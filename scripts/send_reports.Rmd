This script shows how to use googledrive to upload and store a copy of a report, then generate text for an email to send.

We assume your running this from the root of the austraits directory and that you've already built austraits and the report you want to send.

First load google drive:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(googledrive)
```

To check drive is running, try the following. You'll need to authenticate using the austraits email:

```{r}
drive_find(n_max = 5)
```

Now source functions
```{r}
source("scripts/send_report_functions.R")
```

To upload a report simply run

```{r}
out <- upload_report("Angevin_2010")
```

Now generate text for an email, using the details returned from the previous function. As this is html, we need to write it to file:

```{r}
out %>% 
  review_email_text1() %>%
  writeLines("export/email.html")
```

Open the file "export/email.html" and copy/paste into gmail.
