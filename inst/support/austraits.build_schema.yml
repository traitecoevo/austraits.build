# A key describing the structure of the compiled `AusTraits` dataset

austraits:
  description: The compiled `AusTraits` dataset.
  type: list
  elements:
    traits:
      description: A table containing measurements of plant traits.
      type: table
      elements:
        dataset_id: &dataset_id Primary identifier for each study contributed to AusTraits; most often these are scientific papers, books, or online resources. By default this should be the name of the first author and year of publication, e.g. `Falster_2005`.
        taxon_name: &taxon_name Scientific name of the taxon on which traits were sampled, without authorship. When possible, this is the currently accepted (botanical) or valid (zoological) scientific name, but might also be a higher taxonomic level. [biodiversity.org.au:canonical_name]
        site_name: &site_name Name of the site where the individual was sampled. Cross-references between similar columns in `sites` and `traits`.
        context_name: &context_name Name of contextual scenario where the individual was sampled. Cross-references between similar columns in `contexts` and `traits`.
        entity_id: &entity_id A unique identifier that encodes the taxon, population, and/or individual that is connected to a trait value. A taxon-level trait value will have an entity_id that only includes a taxon component. A population-level trait value will have an entity_id that includes both taxon and population components. And an individual-level trait value will have an entity_id that includes taxon, population, and individual components.  
        observation_number: &observation_number A field to indicate that multiple measurements have been made on the same entity over time. Observation number defaults to 1, unless it is manually added as a column at the dataset level or to individual trait entries.
        method_number: &method_number A field to indicate when a trait is measured multiple times on the same entity, with different methods used for each entry. Method number defaults to 1, unless it is manually added as a column or to individual traits.
        trait_name: &trait_name Name of the trait sampled. Allowable values specified in the table `definitions`.
        value: &value The measured value of a trait, site property or context property.
        unit: &units Units of the sampled trait value after aligning with AusTraits standards.
        collection_date: &collection_date Date sample was taken, in the format `yyyy-mm-dd`, `yyyy-mm` or `yyyy`, depending on the resoluton specified. Alternatively an overall range for the study can be indicating, with the starting and ending sample date sepatated by a `/`, as in 2010-10/2011-03
        entity_type: *entity_type
        value_type: *value_type
        basis_of_value: *basis_of_value
        replicates: &replicates Number of replicate measurements that comprise a recorded trait measurement. A numeric value (or range) is ideal and appropriate if the value type is a `mean`, `median`, `min` or  `max`. For these value types, if replication is unknown the entry should be `unknown`. If the value type is `raw_value` the replicate value should be 1. If the trait is categorical or the value indicates a measurement for an entire species (or other taxon) replicate value should be `.na`.
        basis_of_record: *basis_of_record 
        life_stage: &life_stage A field to indicate the life stage or age class of the entity measured. Standard values are `adult`, `sapling`, `seedling` and `juvenile`.         
        measurement_remarks: &measurement_remarks Brief comments or notes accompanying the trait measurement, often used to indicate why multiple method numbers have been assigned or to document original sources for data compilations.
        original_name: &orginal_name Name given to taxon in the original data supplied by the authors.

        taxonIDClean: An identifier for the cleaned name before it is updated to the currently accepted name usage. This may be a global unique identifier or an identifier specific to the data set. Must be resolvable within this dataset. XXXX for APC/APNI at least this should be the [biodiversity.org.au:scientificNameID] because that way it applies to both APC/APNI, while we'd been matching to taxon_ID, which meant there were no identifiers for APNI names not in APC. XXXX [TBC - cleaned_name_taxon_ID]
        taxonomicStatusClean: The status of the use of the `cleaned_name` as a label for a taxon.     Requires taxonomic opinion to define the scope of a taxon. Rules of priority then are used to define the taxonomic status of the nomenclature contained in that scope, combined with the experts opinion. It must be linked to a specific taxonomic reference that defines the concept. [biodiversity.org.au:taxonomicStatus | dwc:taxonomicStatus] [TBC - cleaned_name_taxonomic_status]
        alternativeTaxonomicStatusClean: The taxonomic status of alternative taxonomic records with `cleaned_name` as the accepted (botanical) or valid (zoological) taxon name. [TBC - cleaned_name_alternative_taxonomic_status] 
        acceptedNameUsageID: &accepted_name_usage_ID The taxonID associated with the accepted (botanical) or valid (zoological) concept for this taxon according to the classification being exported. eg. APC for Australian Plants. [biodiversity.org.au:acceptedNameUsageID | dwc:acceptedNameUsageID] XXXX leaving for now, but suggest we switch to taxon_ID since we are aligning with taxon_name not accepted_name_usage. We will still have accepted_name_usage in the taxa table. XXXX   [TBC - accepted_name_usage_ID]

        taxonRank: The taxonomic rank of the most specific name in the scientificName. [biodiversity.org.au:taxonRank | dwc:taxonRank] [TBC - taxon_rank] 
        taxonomicStatus: The status of the use of the scientificName as a label for the taxon in regard to the 'accepted (or valid) taxonomy'. The assigned taxonomic status must be linked to a specific taxonomic reference that defines the concept. [biodiversity.org.au:taxonomicStatus | dwc:taxonomicStatus] [TBC - taxonomic_status] 
        taxonDistribution: Known distribution of the taxon, by Australian state. [biodiversity.org.au:taxonDistribution] [TBC - taxon_distribution]     
        genus: Genus of the taxon without authorship. [biodiversity.org.au:genericName | dwc:genericName] XXXX_in DarwinCore, APC, genus is used for with authorship. Since this column is simply listing the genus of a fully aligned taxon name (which could be genus with authorship), I think without authorship is appropriate. I'd also rather still call it genus, but wanted to alert you_XXXX
        family: Family of the taxon. [biodiversity.org.au:family | dwc:family]
