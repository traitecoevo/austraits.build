# A key describing the structure of the compiled `AusTraits` dataset

austraits:
  description: The compiled `AusTraits` dataset.
  type: list
  elements:
    traits:
      description: A table containing measurements of traits.
      type: table
      elements:
        dataset_id: &dataset_id Primary identifier for each study contributed to AusTraits; most often these are scientific papers, books, or online resources. By default this should be the name of the first author and year of publication, e.g. `Falster_2005`.
        observation_id: &observation_id A unique integral identifier for the observation, where an observation is all measurements made on an individual at a single point in time. It is important for joining traits coming from the same `observation_id`. Within each dataset, observation_id's are unique combinations of `taxon_name`, `population_id`, `individual_id`, and `temporal_id`.
        taxon_name: &taxon_name Scientific name of the taxon on which traits were sampled, without authorship. When possible, this is the currently accepted (botanical) or valid (zoological) scientific name, but might also be a higher taxonomic level. [biodiversity.org.au:canonical_name]
        trait_name: &trait_name Name of the trait sampled. Allowable values specified in the table `definitions`.
        value: &value The measured value of a trait, location property or context property.
        unit: &units Units of the sampled trait value after aligning with AusTraits standards.
        entity_type: *entity_type
        value_type: *value_type
        basis_of_value: *basis_of_value
        replicates: &replicates Number of replicate measurements that comprise a recorded trait measurement. A numeric value (or range) is ideal and appropriate if the value type is a `mean`, `median`, `min` or  `max`. For these value types, if replication is unknown the entry should be `unknown`. If the value type is `raw_value` the replicate value should be 1. If the trait is categorical or the value indicates a measurement for an entire species (or other taxon) replicate value should be `.na`.
        basis_of_record: *basis_of_record 
        life_stage: &life_stage A field to indicate the life stage or age class of the entity measured. Standard values are `adult`, `sapling`, `seedling` and `juvenile`.         
        population_id: &population_id A unique integer identifier for a population, where a population is defined as individuals growing in the same location (location_id /location_name) and plot (plot_id, a context category) and being subjected to the same treatment (treatment_id, a context category).
        individual_id: &individual_id A unique integer identifier for an individual, with individuals numbered sequentially within each dataset by taxon by population grouping. Most often each row of data represents an individual, but in some datasets trait data collected on a single individual is presented across multiple rows of data, such as if the same trait is measured using different methods or the same individual is measured repeatedly across time.
        temporal_id: &temporal_id A unique integer identifier assigned where repeat observations are made on the same individual (or population, or taxon) across time. The identifier links to specific information in the context table.
        source_id: &source_id For datasets that are compilations, an identifier for the original data source.
        location_id: &location_id A unique integer identifier for a location, with locations numbered sequentially within a dataset. The identifier links to specific information in the location table.
        entity_context_id: &entity_context_id A unique integer identifier indicating specific contextual properties of an individual, possibly including the individual's sex or caste (for social insects). 
        plot_id: &plot_id A unique integer identifier for a plot, where a plot is a distinct collection of organisms within a single geographic location, such as plants growing on different aspects or blocks in an experiment. The identifier links to specific information in the context table.
        treatment_id: &treatment_id A unique integer identifier for a treatment, where a treatment is any experimental manipulation to an organism's growing/living conditions. The identifier links to specific information in the context table.
        collection_date: &collection_date Date sample was taken, in the format `yyyy-mm-dd`, `yyyy-mm` or `yyyy`, depending on the resoluton specified. Alternatively an overall range for the study can be indicating, with the starting and ending sample date sepatated by a `/`, as in 2010-10/2011-03
        measurement_remarks: &measurement_remarks Brief comments or notes accompanying the trait measurement, often used to indicate why multiple method numbers have been assigned or to document original sources for data compilations.
        method_id: &method_id A unique integer identifier indicating a trait is measured multiple times on the same entity, with different methods used for each entry. This field is only used if a single trait is measured using multiple methods within the same dataset. The identifier links to specific information in the context table.
        original_name: &original_name Name given to taxon in the original data supplied by the authors.

        link_id: Variable indicating which identifier column in the traits table contains the specified `link_vals`.

        taxonIDClean: An identifier for the cleaned name before it is updated to the currently accepted name usage. This may be a global unique identifier or an identifier specific to the data set. Must be resolvable within this dataset. XXXX for APC/APNI at least this should be the [biodiversity.org.au:scientificNameID] because that way it applies to both APC/APNI, while we'd been matching to taxon_ID, which meant there were no identifiers for APNI names not in APC. XXXX [TBC - cleaned_name_taxon_ID]
        taxonomicStatusClean: The status of the use of the `cleaned_name` as a label for a taxon.     Requires taxonomic opinion to define the scope of a taxon.

        genus: Genus of the taxon without authorship. [biodiversity.org.au:genericName | dwc:genericName] XXXX_in DarwinCore, APC, genus is used for with authorship. Since this column is simply listing the genus of a fully aligned taxon name (which could be genus with authorship), I think without authorship is appropriate. I'd also rather still call it genus, but wanted to alert you_XXXX
        family: Family of the taxon. [biodiversity.org.au:family | dwc:family]

      type: array
      elements:
        var_in: Name of trait in the original data submitted.
        unit_in: Units of trait in the original data submitted.
        trait_name: *trait_name
        entity_type: *entity_type
        value_type: *value_type
        basis_of_record: *basis_of_record
        basis_of_value: *basis_of_value
        replicates: *replicates
        measurement_remarks: *measurement_remarks
        methods: *methods
        life_stage: *life_stage
    substitutions:
      description: A list of any "find and replace" substitutions needed to get the data into the right format.
      type: array
      values:
        trait_name: Trait where substitutions are required.
        find: Contributor's trait value that needs to be changed.
        replace: AusTraits supported replacement value.
    taxonomic_updates:
      description: A table of taxonomic name changes needed to align original names in the dataset with taxon names in the chosen taxonomic reference(s).
      type: array
      values:
        find: *original_name
        replace: *taxon_name
        reason: Records why the change was implemented, e.g. `typos`, `taxonomic synonyms`, and `standardising spellings`
    exclude_observations:
      description: A table of observations to remove from the compilation.
      type: array
      values:
        variable: A variable from the traits table, typically `taxon_name` or `location_name`
        find: Value of variable to remove.
        reason: Records why the data was removed, e.g. `exotic`
    questions: A place to record any queries we have about the dataset (recorded as a named array), including notes on any additional traits that may have been collected in the study but have not been incorporated into AusTraits.
