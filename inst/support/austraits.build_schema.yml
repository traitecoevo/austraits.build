# A key describing the structure of the compiled `AusTraits` dataset

austraits:
  description: The compiled `AusTraits` dataset.
  type: list
  elements:
    traits:
      description: A table containing measurements of traits.
      type: table
      elements:
        dataset_id: &dataset_id Primary identifier for each study contributed to AusTraits; most often these are scientific papers, books, or online resources. By default this should be the name of the first author and year of publication, e.g. `Falster_2005`.
        taxon_name: &taxon_name Scientific name of the taxon on which traits were sampled, without authorship. When possible, this is the currently accepted (botanical) or valid (zoological) scientific name, but might also be a higher taxonomic level.
        observation_id: &observation_id A unique integral identifier for the observation, where an observation is all measurements made on an individual at a single point in time. It is important for joining traits coming from the same `observation_id`. Within each dataset, observation_id's are unique combinations of `taxon_name`, `population_id`, `individual_id`, and `temporal_id`.
        trait_name: &trait_name Name of the trait sampled. Allowable values specified in the table `definitions`.
        value: &value The measured value of a trait, location property or context property.
        unit: &units Units of the sampled trait value after aligning with AusTraits standards.
        entity_type: *entity_type
        value_type: *value_type
        basis_of_value: *basis_of_value
        replicates: &replicates Number of replicate measurements that comprise a recorded trait measurement. A numeric value (or range) is ideal and appropriate if the value type is a `mean`, `median`, `min` or  `max`. For these value types, if replication is unknown the entry should be `unknown`. If the value type is `raw_value` the replicate value should be 1. If the trait is categorical or the value indicates a measurement for an entire species (or other taxon) replicate value should be `.na`.
        basis_of_record: *basis_of_record 
        life_stage: &life_stage A field to indicate the life stage or age class of the entity measured. Standard values are `adult`, `sapling`, `seedling` and `juvenile`.         
        population_id: &population_id A unique integer identifier for a population, where a population is defined as individuals growing in the same location (location_id /location_name) and plot (plot_id, a context category) and being subjected to the same treatment (treatment_id, a context category).
        individual_id: &individual_id A unique integer identifier for an individual, with individuals numbered sequentially within each dataset by taxon by population grouping. Most often each row of data represents an individual, but in some datasets trait data collected on a single individual is presented across multiple rows of data, such as if the same trait is measured using different methods or the same individual is measured repeatedly across time.
        temporal_id: &temporal_id A unique integer identifier assigned where repeat observations are made on the same individual (or population, or taxon) across time. The identifier links to specific information in the context table.
        source_id: &source_id For datasets that are compilations, an identifier for the original data source.
        location_id: &location_id A unique integer identifier for a location, with locations numbered sequentially within a dataset. The identifier links to specific information in the location table.
        entity_context_id: &entity_context_id A unique integer identifier indicating specific contextual properties of an individual, possibly including the individual's sex or caste (for social insects). 
        plot_id: &plot_id A unique integer identifier for a plot, where a plot is a distinct collection of organisms within a single geographic location, such as plants growing on different aspects or blocks in an experiment. The identifier links to specific information in the context table.
        treatment_id: &treatment_id A unique integer identifier for a treatment, where a treatment is any experimental manipulation to an organism's growing/living conditions. The identifier links to specific information in the context table.
        collection_date: &collection_date Date sample was taken, in the format `yyyy-mm-dd`, `yyyy-mm` or `yyyy`, depending on the resoluton specified. Alternatively an overall range for the study can be indicating, with the starting and ending sample date sepatated by a `/`, as in 2010-10/2011-03
        measurement_remarks: &measurement_remarks Brief comments or notes accompanying the trait measurement.
        method_id: &method_id A unique integer identifier indicating a trait is measured multiple times on the same entity, with different methods used for each entry. This field is only used if a single trait is measured using multiple methods within the same dataset. The identifier links to specific information in the context table.
        original_name: &original_name Name given to taxon in the original data supplied by the authors.

        notes: Generic notes about the study and processing of data.
    locations:
      description: A list of study locations (sites) and information about each of the study locations where data were collected. Each should include at least three variables - `latitude (deg)`, `longitude (deg)` and `description`. Additional variables can be included where available. Set to `.na` for botanical collections and field studies where data values are a mean across many locations.
      type: array
      elements:
        location_name: The location name used by the data contributor or a generic location name designated by AusTraits when one is not provided.
        description: A brief vegetation or location description.
        latitude (deg): Location latitude, in decimal degrees.        
        longitude (deg): Location latitude, in decimal degrees.
        locality: An identifiable place name (optional field).
    contexts:
      description: Contextual characteristics associated with information in `traits`.
      type: array
      elements:
        context_property: The context property represented by the data in the column specified by `var_in`.
        category: The category of contextual data. Options are `plot` (a distinct collection of organisms within a single geographic location, such as plants growing on different aspects or blocks in an experiment), `treatment` (an experimental treatment), `entity_context` (contextual information to record about the entity the isn't documented elsewhere, including the entity's sex, caste), `temporal` (indicating when repeat observations are made on the same individual (or population, or taxon) across time) and `method` (indicating the same trait was measured on the same individual (or population, or taxon) using multiple methods).
        var_in: Name of column with contextual data in the original data submitted.
        find: The contextual values in the original data submitted (optional)
        value: The standardised contextual values, aligning syntax and wording with other studies. 
        description: A description of the contextual values.
    traits:
      description: A translation table, mapping traits and units from a contributed study onto corresponding variables in AusTraits. The methods used to collect the data are also specified here.
      type: array
      elements:
        var_in: Name of trait in the original data submitted.
        unit_in: Units of trait in the original data submitted.
        trait_name: *trait_name
        entity_type: *entity_type
        value_type: *value_type
        basis_of_record: *basis_of_record

      description: A list of any "find and replace" substitutions needed to get the data into the right format.
      type: array
      values:
        trait_name: Trait where substitutions are required.
        find: Contributor's trait value that needs to be changed.
        replace: AusTraits supported replacement value.
    taxonomic_updates:
      description: A table of taxonomic name changes needed to align original names in the dataset with taxon names in the chosen taxonomic reference(s).
      type: array
      values:
        find: *original_name
        replace: *taxon_name
        reason: Records why the change was implemented, e.g. `typos`, `taxonomic synonyms`, and `standardising spellings`
    exclude_observations:
      description: A table of observations to remove from the compilation.
      type: array
      values:
