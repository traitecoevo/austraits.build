# Introduction

## About AusTraits

`AusTraits` is an open-source compilation of trait data for Australian plant taxa. The traits we are considering are any morphological, functional or physiological variable that: 1. Tend to vary widely among taxa; and 2. Have been collected across a moderate number of taxa. Many people collect trait data, and as such, data is spread across many sources, under a variety of formats and terms.

AusTraits combines all of these data fragments into a harmonised, error checked, publicly available compilation.

AusTraits is built from many different sources, here referred to as `studies` (so called because the sources are most-often individual scientific papers), with each study denoted by a distinct `dataset_id`. Our data processing pipeline seeks to combine all of the different studies in a transparent and reproducible way. In addition, the AusTraits repository consists of configuration files defining the list of known taxa, the definitions for each trait and table, and appropriate unit conversions. Detailed descriptions of the `definitions`, `database structure`, and `file format` are all available on the [project homepage](http://traitecoevo.github.io/austraits.build/) under the `Details` tab.

## Purpose of this report

The AusTraits compilation includes data from a study with dataset_id **` `r dataset_id` `**. This document describes the information we have on that study.
This report gives both you, as a data contributor, and us, as AusTraits compilers, the opportunity to:

1. Verify that our understanding and handling of your data is correct
2. Provide any missing information about the data

Data from each study in AusTraits is organised into two files, within its own folder:

- ` `r dataset_id`/data.csv`: contains the primary trait measurements, in either long or wide format
- ` `r dataset_id`/metadata.yml`: contains all the contextual data (or metadata) about the trait measurements.

Data from those files has been used to generate the report below.

Please review the report and the original files, check they are correct, and send updates where appropriate. Please also answer the queries in the report below, appearing in orange. These appear again as a list at the end of the document.

We would welcome any of the following:

- Answers to the list of questions
- Expanding or correcting the information in the `metadata.yml`
- Updates to the data

To aid your review, we have attached the following files:

- `r dataset_id`/data.csv` and ` `r dataset_id`/metadata.yml`: The raw inputs for your study.

### Send feedback by 

1. **Copying and pasting the questions at the end of the report into an email and answering as many as possible.** 

    The majority of the questions are automatically generated prompts to look at the pertinent metadata or data plot (or table) and confirm it matches your expectations - for these simply answer "yes". There are often a few questions targeted to your study, written by an AusTraits data curator as they merged in your study. Please consider these carefully, as they usually indicate missing metadata or some source of ambiguity (e.g. units not provided, uncertainty about trait value substitutions).    
2. If appropriate, send a new spreadsheet to replace the existing `data.csv` file.
3. You may edit the `metadata.yml` file associated with your study yourself, but most contributors prefer to answer the flagged questions and have an AusTraits data curator make the changes to the file.
4. Sending back your responses and any edited files.

## Taxa sampled

We have records on `r data_study$traits$taxon_name %>% unique() %>% length()` taxa from your study. We have attempted to align taxon names with [the Australian Plant Census  (APC)](https://biodiversity.org.au/nsl/services/APC) -- a global working list of all known Australian vascular plant taxa. The full list of names for taxa recorded in your study are listed below.

# Trait measurements

## Overview

The dataset includes `r data_study$traits %>% nrow()` individual data points from `r data_study$traits$taxon_name %>% unique() %>% length()` taxa, with data included for the following `r data_study$traits$trait_name %>% unique() %>% length()` traits:

```{r summary_table, results='asis', echo=FALSE}
n_records <- data_study$traits %>%
  group_by(trait_name) %>%
    summarise(
        taxa = length(unique(taxon_name)),
        records = length(value)) %>%
   mutate(records_per_taxa = round(records / taxa, digits=2) )

n_records %>%
  my_kable_styling()
```

# Taxon list

We have records on the following taxa from your study. We have attempted to align taxon names in this study with the Australian Plant Census (APC) or Australian Plant Names Index (APNI). 

## Full taxa list

The table below shows the table of all taxa in this study, where possible using the name aligned with the APC. Columns are as follows:

```{r, results='asis', echo=FALSE}
schema$austraits$elements$taxa$elements %>%
  util_list_to_df1() %>%
  my_kable_styling()
```

Clicking on the name will take you to the relevant taxonomic record in the APC or APNI, where known:

```{r taxon_list2, results='asis', echo=FALSE}
data_study$taxa %>%
  select(one_of(names(schema$austraits$elements$taxa$elements))) -> tmp

if(nrow(tmp) < 10000 ){
  tmp %>%
  mutate(
    taxon_name = as_link(taxon_id, taxon_name)) %>%
  mutate_all(replace_na, "") %>%
  my_kable_styling()
} else{
  cat(crayon:red("\t\tTable too large to dsiplay\n"))
  tmp %>%
  mutate_all(replace_na, "") %>% 
  write_csv(paste0(dataset_id,"_taxa.csv"))
}
```


To create the list of aligned taxa, we needed to make some taxonomic changes. This involved two stages. 

* **Stage 1**: Where possible (i.e. there was no or only a few characters difference), the name you supplied was matched automatically with a known name in APC or APNI. In other cases we may have aligned the taxa by searching for an appropriate match. Such changes are documented in the study metadata file.  The variable `cleaned_name` shows the updated name. The variable `d1` shows the number of characters difference between the `original_name` and `cleaned_name`. 
* **Stage 2**: Once aligned with a known name, we used the APC to update the `cleaned_name` to an accepted name. The taxonomic status of the cleaned name is indicated in column `status cleaned name`. If accepted, no change was made. If it is a synonym or otherwise, the name was changed according to the recommendation given in the APC. Where they existed, we preferred to take the accepted status of an `cleaned_name`, if it existed. Alternative status values are indicated in brackets. This indicate if alternative uses of the name were ever applied. 

Links on `cleaned_name` and `taxon_name` take you to the APC or APNI record for that name.

```{r}
data_study$taxonomic_updates %>% select(-dataset_id) %>% 
  filter(original_name !=taxon_name) %>% 
  mutate(
    d1 = purrr::map2_dbl(original_name, cleaned_name, ~adist(.x, .y)) %>% as.character() %>% str_replace("0", ""),
    d2 = purrr::map2_dbl(taxon_name, cleaned_name, ~adist(.x, .y)) %>% as.character() %>% str_replace("0", ""),
    cleaned_name = as_link(cleaned_scientific_name_id, cleaned_name),
    taxon_name = as_link(taxon_id, taxon_name),
    cleaned_name_alternative_taxonomic_status = replace_na(cleaned_name_alternative_taxonomic_status, ""),
    `status cleaned name` = sprintf("%s %s", cleaned_name_taxonomic_status, ifelse(cleaned_name_alternative_taxonomic_status=="", "", paste("(", cleaned_name_alternative_taxonomic_status, ")")))
    ) %>% 
  select(original_name, d1, cleaned_name, d2, taxon_name, `status cleaned name`) %>%
  mutate_all(replace_na, "") %>% 
  my_kable_styling()
```

## Unknown taxa

We were unable to find taxonomic matches for the following taxa in the data. Where genus and family are shown, the specified genus aligns with an accepted genus. The term `unplaced` appears as the `status` for names on the APNI list, but not yet reviewed by the APC.

```{r taxa_list3, results='asis', echo=FALSE}
data_study$taxa %>%
  filter(is.na(taxon_id)) %>%
  select(one_of(names(schema$austraits$elements$taxa$elements))) %>%
  select(-taxon_id, -scientific_name_id, -taxon_distribution, -establishment_means) %>%
  mutate_all(replace_na, "") %>%
  my_kable_styling()
```


```{r, results='asis', echo=FALSE}
new_question("(section `taxonomic_updates`) Do these taxonomic alignments and corrections look reasonable?")
```
