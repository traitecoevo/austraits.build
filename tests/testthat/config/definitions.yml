# A key describing the structure of the compiled `AusTraits` dataset

austraits:
  description: The compiled `AusTraits` dataset.
  type: list
  elements:
    traits:
      description: A table containing measurements of plant traits.
      type: table
      elements:
        dataset_id: &dataset_id Primary identifier for each study contributed to AusTraits; most often these are scientific papers, books, or online resources. By default this should be the name of the first author and year of publication, e.g. `Falster_2005`.
        taxon_name: &taxon_name Whenever possible, this field indicates the current accepted scientific name of a taxon, per the Australian Plant Census (APC). Alternatively, `taxon_name` can indicate an alignment with a name included in the comprehensive Australian Plant Names Index (APNI), but not currently marked as accepted in APC, or a name that cannot be aligned to available lists of Australian plant names.
        site_name: &site_name Name of the site where the individual was sampled. Cross-references between similar columns in `sites` and `traits`.
        context_name: &context_name Name of contextual senario where the individual was sampled. Cross-references between similar columns in `contexts` and `traits`.
        observation_id: &observation_id A unique identifier for the observation, useful for joining traits coming from the same `observation_id`. For wide datasets, these are assigned automatically based on the `dataset_id` and row number of the raw data.
        trait_name: &trait_name Name of the trait sampled. Allowable values specified in the table `definitions`.
        value: &value Measured value.
        unit: &units Units of the sampled trait value after aligning with AusTraits standards.
        collection_date: &collection_date Date sample was taken, in the format `yyyy-mm-dd`, `yyyy-mm` or `yyyy`, depending on the resoluton specified.
        value_type: *value_type
        replicates: &replicates Number of replicate measurements that comprise the data points for the trait for each measurement. A numeric value (or range) is ideal and appropriate if the value type is a `mean`, `median`, `min` or  `max`. For these value types, if replication is unknown the entry should be `unknown`. If the value type is `raw_value` the replicate value should be 1. If the value type is `expert_mean`, `expert_min`, or `expert_max` the replicate value should be `.na`.
        collection_type: &collection_type A field to indicate where the majority of plants on which traits were measured were collected -  in the `field`, `lab`, `glasshouse`, `botanical collection`, or `literature`. The latter should only be used when the data were sourced from the literature and the collection type is unknown.
        sample_age_class: &sample_age_class A field to indicate if the study was completed on `adult` or `juvenile` plants.
        measurement_remarks: &measurement_remarks Comments or notes accompanying the trait measurement.
        original_name: &orginal_name Name given to taxon in the original data supplied by the authors.
