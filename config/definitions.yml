# A key describing the structure of the compiled `AusTraits` dataset

austraits:
  description: The compiled `AusTraits` dataset
  type: list
  elements:
    traits:
      description: A table containing measurements of plant traits
      type: table
      elements:
        dataset_id: &dataset_id Primary identifier for each study contributed into AusTraits; most often these are scientific papers, books, or online resources. By default should be name of first author and year of publication, e.g. `Falster_2005`.
        species_name: &species_name Name of species after aligning taxonomy with standard sources.
        site_name: &site_name Name of site where species was sampled. Cross-references between similar columns in context and data.
        observation_id: A unique identifier for the observation, useful for joining traits coming from the same observation_id. Observation ids are assigned automatically, based on `dataset_id` and row number in the file `data.csv`.
        trait_name: &trait_name Name of trait sampled. Allowable values specified in the table `traits`.
        value: &value Value of trait sampled. In the master dataset these are all stored as characters, then converted to numeric later where appropriate.
        unit: &units Units of the sampled trait value after aligning with AusTraits standards.
        value_type: *value_type
        replicates: &replicates Number of replicate measurements that comprise the data points for the trait for each measurement. A numeric value (or range) is ideal and appropriate if the value type is a `mean`, `median`, `min` or  `max`. For these value types, if replication is unknown the entry should be `unknown`. If the value type is `raw_value` the replicate value should be `1`. If the value type is `expert_mean`, `expert_min`, or `expert_max` the replicate value should be `.na`.
