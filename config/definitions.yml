    traits:
      description: A table containing measurements of plant traits
      type: table
      elements:
        dataset_id: &dataset_id Primary identifier for each study contributed into AusTraits; most often these are scientific papers, books, or online resources. By default should be name of first author and year of publication, e.g. `Falster_2005`.
        species_name: &species_name Name of species after aligning taxonomy with standard sources.
        site_name: &site_name Name of site where species was sampled. Cross-references between similar columns in context and data.
        observation_id: A unique identifier for the observation, useful for joining traits coming from the same observation_id. Observation ids are assigned automatically, based on `dataset_id` and row number in the file `data.csv`.
        trait_name: &trait_name Name of trait sampled. Allowable values specified in the table `traits`.
        value: &value Value of trait sampled. In the master dataset these are all stored as characters, then converted to numeric later where appropriate.
        unit: &units Units of the sampled trait value after aligning with AusTraits standards.
        value_type: *value_type
        replicates: &replicates Number of replicate measurements that comprise the data points for the trait for each measurement. A numeric value (or range) is ideal and appropriate if the value type is a `mean`, `median`, `min` or  `max`. For these value types, if replication is unknown the entry should be `unknown`. If the value type is `raw_value` the replicate value should be `1`. If the value type is `expert_mean`, `expert_min`, or `expert_max` the replicate value should be `.na`.
        original_name: &orginal_name Taxonomic name given to species in the original data supplied by the authors
    sites:
      description: A table containing observations of site characteristics associated with information in `data`. Cross referencing between the two dataframes is possible using combinations of the variables `dataset_id`, `site_name`.
      type: table
      elements:
        dataset_id: *dataset_id
        site_name: *site_name
        site_property: The site characteristic being recorded. Name should include units of measurement, e.g. `longitude (deg)`. Ideally we have at least these variables for each site - `longitude (deg)`, `latitude (deg)`, `description`.
        value: *value
    methods:
      description: A table containing details on methods with which data were collected, including time frame and source
      type: table
      elements:
        dataset_id: *dataset_id
        trait_name: *trait_name
        methods: &methods A textual description of the methods used to collect the trait data. Whenever available, methods are taken near-verbatim from referenced souce. Methods can include descriptions such as 'measured on herbarium specimens','data from the literature', or a detailed description of the field or lab methods used to collect the data.
        year_collected_start: &year_collected_start The year data collection commenced
        year_collected_end: &year_collected_end The year data collection was completed
        description: &description A 1-2 sentence description of the purpose of the study. 
        collection_type: &collection_type A field to indicate where the plants on which traits were measured were collected -  in the `field`, `lab`, `glasshouse`, `herbarium specimens`, or `literature`. The latter should only be used when the data were sourced from the literature and the collection type is unknown. 
        sample_age_class: &sample_age_class A field to indicate if the study was completed on `adult` or `juvenile` plants
        sampling_strategy: &sampling_strategy A written description of how study sites were selected and how study individuals were selected. When available, this information is lifted verbatim from a published manuscript. For herbarium studies, this field ideally indicates which herbaria were 'sampled' to measure a specific trait
        source_primary_citation: Citation for primary source. This detail is genearted from the primary source in the metadata
        source_primary_key: Citation key for primary source in `sources`. The key is typically of format Surname_year

    taxonomy:
      description: A table containing details on species taxonomy associated with information in `data`. Cross referencing between the two dataframes is possible using the variable `species_name`.

In addition we have tried to align these names with the [`Australian Plant Census` (APC)](https://biodiversity.org.au/nsl/services/apc) and the [`Australian Plant Names Index` (APNI)](https://biodiversity.org.au/nsl/services/APNI).
