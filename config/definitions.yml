Alternatively, the ovary may be embedded in the receptacle and therefore be located below the insertion level of the remaining floral organs (i.e., the ovary is inferior and the flower is epigynous). Flowers with a hypanthium may either have a superior ovary (perigyny; e.g., many Rosaceae) or an inferior ovary (epiperigyny). It is also possible that the ovary is inferior to a certain degree only, such as half-inferior, if the receptacle is surrounding the ovary to its mid-level.

In flowers with perianth whorls fused along their complete length (e.g., Convolvulus), perianth parts are counted based on merism (e.g., if a calyx has 5 distinct sepals and the corolla is entirely fused, then the corolla is often interpreted to consist of five fused petals), anatomy (e.g., number of vascular traces), development (e.g., number of primordia), or comparison with closely related taxa.

    flower_perianth_fusion:
      description: Fusion of perianth organs (congenital or postgenital) at anthesis, recorded on a continuous scale, from 0 (free parts) to 1 (parts fused along their entire length). Partial fusion was recorded using an approximate number between these two extremes (e.g., 0.1 corresponds to basal fusion, 0.5 to fusion along half of the length of perianth parts). In case of multiple whorls, this trait records within-whorl fusion. For example, if organs within each whorl are fused along their entire length, a trait value of 1 is recorded. In cases where organs of two whorls are fused into a common tubular structure, such as frequently observed in monocots (e.g., Polygonatum), the perianth is considered to be fused. If the two (or more) whorls differed in their extent of fusion, a range of trait values may be recorded. For example, if the calyx is only basally fused, up to 10% of its length, but the corolla is entirely fused, a range of 0.1 to 1 is recorded as the trait value for the species.

In case of flowers with two or more perianth whorls, species are considered actinomorphic if all whorls are actinomorphic and as zygomorphic if one or more whorls are zygomorphic. Trait is not applicable when the perianth is missing. (Definition and trait values derived from Schoenenberger et al. (2020)  for their character '207. Symmetry of perianth (D1)')
      type: categorical
      label: Symmetry of perianth
      values:
        actinomorphic_general: Perianth displaying radial symmetry
        actinomorphic_rotational: Perianth that can be equally divided into three or more identical sections that, when rotated around the center of the flower by some number of degrees, exactly match each other in orientation and shape.

      description: Perianth phyllotaxis at anthesis. Perianth parts may be organised in one or more whorls or along a continuous spiral, usually with wide divergence angles more or less equal to 137.5 degrees. Less frequently, perianth phyllotaxis may be irregular. Perianth phyllotaxis at anthesis may differ from phyllotaxis of perianth part primordia at their inception and it is not uncommon that spirally initiated perianths become whorled later through development.

    flower_perianth_differentiation:
      description: The ways in which perianth organs may look different from each other in a given flower. Typically, outer perianth parts are sepaloid and protect the other floral organs during floral development, while inner organs are often petaloid and play a role in pollinator attraction (Endress, 1994). However, it is also possible that all parts are either sepaloid or petaloid but remain differentiated in shape, size, and/or texture. In case of spiral perianths, differentiation may be continuous (i.e., gradual), whereby two successively initiated organs are very similar or only slightly different, while the outermost and innermost organs at both ends of the spiral are very different from each other (e.g., Chimonanthus). In the special case of perianths consisting of a single whorl, they are scored as undifferentiated. This perianth differentiation trait may be seen as both functional (the parting vs. sharing of functions among perianth parts) and developmental (the expression of a genetic program for different forms of perianth parts vs. a single program for a single type of perianth part morphology). Within-whorl differentiation, whereby organs of the same whorl take different forms, is common in zygomorphic flowers (e.g., Balsaminaceae, Fabaceae, Orchidaceae) but is not taken into account with this trait. This trait is not applicable when the perianth is absent. (Definition and trait values derived from Schoenenberger et al. (2020)  for their character '234. Perianth differentiation (D1)')

    flower_filament:
      description: Trait that considers the absence or presence of the filament, and in the latter case, the shape of the filament. Shape is considered in terms of length and width and is defined in relation to anther length/width. The width of the filament may thus either be broad as in laminar (e.g., Eupomatiaceae) or bulky stamens (e.g., Chloranthaceae), or narrow (filamentous) as found in many core eudicots groups (e.g., Rosaceae). This trait is considered inapplicable when filaments are entirely fused with each other or to the perianth. (Definition and trait values derived from Schoenenberger et al.

      description: Fusion of stamen (and staminode) filaments among each other at anthesis (congenitally or postgenitally) is recorded on a continuous scale, from 0 (free filaments) to 1 (filaments fused along their entire length). Partial fusion is recorded using an approximate number between these two extremes (e.g., 0.1 corresponds to basal fusion, 0.5 to fusion along half of the length of filaments).

    flower_filament_fusion_to_inner_perianth:
      description: The fusion of filaments with the innermost perianth organs at anthesis on a continuous scale, from 0 (filaments completely free from perianth) to 1 (filaments fused along their entire length with the perianth; the 'entire length' of the filament is defined as the distance between the floral base and the joint between filament and anther). Partial fusion is recorded using an approximate number between these two extremes (e.g., 0.1 corresponds to basal fusion, 0.5 to fusion along half of the length of perianth parts). If two (or more) stamen whorls (including staminodial whorls) differ in their extent of filament fusion with the perianth, this trait is recorded as a range of values. For example, if the filaments of an outermost stamen whorl are fused, up to 90% of their length, but an inner whorl only up to 50%, the trait is assigned a range of 0.5 to 0.9. The rationale for this is to provide a general trait that allows comparison of fusion among all angiosperms. (Definition derived from Schoenenberger et al. (2020)  for their character '308.

    flower_anther_orientation:
      description: Orientation of anther at anthesis. Anthers of angiosperms are rather uniform in their basic structure. They normally have four microsporangia (pollen sacs) that are arranged pair-wise in two thecae. The two microsporangia of a theca usually release their pollen grains through a common opening (stomium). Often, it is difficult to establish anther orientation clearly in a flower as this is a gradual feature with many intermediate stages. (Definition and trait values derived from Schoenenberger et al.

    flower_structural_carpels_count:
      description: Number of fertile or sterile carpels in bisexual or female flowers, recorded as a continuous character (with integer values of 1 and above). Includes the number of co-occurring carpellodes (sterile carpels) because this number is often more easily obtained from the literature than the actual number of fertile carpels. However, the number of carpellodes in male flowers is ignored for this character. In multicarpellate, unilocular gynoecia with complete carpel fusion up to the stigma (e.g., Primula), it may be difficult to assess the number of carpels unequivocally. In such cases, the number of carpels is scored only if it is well established based on anatomical or developmental investigations. Similarly, in gynoecia where one or more carpels are reduced (e.g., in the pseudomonomerous gynoecia of some Arecaceae, Stauffer et al., 2002), the total number of structural carpels is only scored when unequivocally determined in the literature.

    flower_gynoecium_placentation:
      description: The different types of placentation in apocarpous/unicarpellate and in syncarpous gynoecia. In apocarpous and unicarpellate gynoecia, placentation is often described as marginal as the ovules are usually attached along the ventral slit (i.e., the zone where the carpel margins become postgenitally closed during carpel development). In syncarpous gynoecia there are three main types of placentation, 1) axile placentation refers to ovaries where the ovules are placed in the angle between carpel flanks in the center of the ovary; 2) in ovaries with parietal placentation the ovules attach to the ovary wall where two carpels meet; 3) in ovaries with free-central placentation the ovules are attached to a central column that emerges from the base of the ovary and protrudes into the non-septate ovary. It is not unusual that syncarpous gynoecia show a transition from proximally axile to a distally parietal placentation (e.g., Polemoniaceae). Basal and apical placentation may occur both in apocarpous/unicarpellate and in syncarpous gynoecia. Usually there is one longitudinal series of ovules attached to each carpel margin. However, both in apocarpous/unicarpellate and in syncarpous gynoecia there may be more than one series of ovules at the flanks of a carpel. These latter cases are referred to as laminar (or laminar-diffuse) placentation (e.g., in some Nymphaeaceae). A placenta that is protruding from its surroundings and has more than two series of ovules (either axile or parietal) is called protruding-diffuse.

Aperture terminology is partly determined by the position of the aperture on the pollen grain (either at the pole or at the equator) and pollen grain polarity, in turn, is determined by the spatial orientation of the microspore in the meiotic tetrad.

    traits:
      description: A table containing measurements of plant traits.
      type: table
      elements:
        dataset_id: &dataset_id Primary identifier for each study contributed into AusTraits; most often these are scientific papers, books, or online resources. By default should be name of first author and year of publication, e.g. `Falster_2005`.
        taxon_name: &taxon_name Whenever possible, this field indicates the currently accepted scientific name of a taxon, per the Australian Plant Census (APC). Alternatively, `taxon_name` can indicate an alignment with a name included in the comprehensive Australian Plant Names Index (APNI) but not currently marked as accepted in APC; or a name that cannot be aligned to available lists of Australian plant names.
        site_name: &site_name Name of site where individual was sampled. Cross-references between similar columns in `sites` and `traits`.
        context_name: &context_name Name of contextual senario where individual was sampled. Cross-references between similar columns in `contexts` and `traits`.
        observation_id: &observation_id A unique identifier for the observation, useful for joining traits coming from the same `observation_id`. For wide datasets, these are assigned automatically, based on the `dataset_id` and row number of the raw data.
        trait_name: &trait_name Name of trait sampled. Allowable values specified in the table `definitions`.
        value: &value Measured value.
        unit: &units Units of the sampled trait value after aligning with AusTraits standards.

        value_type: *value_type
        replicates: &replicates Number of replicate measurements that comprise the data points for the trait for each measurement. A numeric value (or range) is ideal and appropriate if the value type is a `mean`, `median`, `min` or  `max`. For these value types, if replication is unknown the entry should be `unknown`. If the value type is `raw_value` the replicate value should be 1. If the value type is `expert_mean`, `expert_min`, or `expert_max` the replicate value should be `.na`.

          ORCID: ORCID iD (Open Researcher and Contributor ID) for the data collector, if available
          additional_role: Any additional roles the data collector had in the study, a field most frequently used to identify which data contributor is the contact person for the dataset.
          type: categorical
        assistants:
          description: *assistants
        austraits_curators:
          description: *austraits_curators
    dataset:
      description: Study details, including study description, sampling strategy, sampling time frame, and sample age class.
      type: categorical
      values:
        year_collected_start: *year_collected_start
        year_collected_end: *year_collected_end
        description: *description

        sample_age_class: *sample_age_class
        sampling_strategy: *sampling_strategy
        original_file: The name of the file initially submitted to AusTraits
        notes: Generic notes about the study and processing of data
    sites:
      description: A list of study sites and information about each of the study sites where data were collected. A list of sites. Each should include at least three variables - `latitude`, `longitude` and `description`. Additional variables can be included where available. Set to `.na` for botanical collections and field studies where data values are a mean across many locations.
    contexts:
      description: A list of scenarios sites and contextial information about each of the scenarios where data were collected. A list of contexts. Each should include at least two variables - `context_type` and `description`. Additional variables can be included where available. Set to `.na` as default.
    config:
      description: Information on the format of the submitted data file.
      type: categorical
      elements:
        data_is_long_format: Indicates if the data spreadsheet has a vertical (long) or  horizontal (wide) configuration with `yes` or `no` terminology
        variable_match: Identifies which information is in each column in the file `data.csv`, excluding the actual trait data. One element within `variable_match` must be `taxon_name`. Datasets with `data_is_long_format` set to `yes` must also identify which column includes data on `value` and `trait_name`. Other allowed values include `date`, `site_name`, `observation_id`, `context_name` if these columns are present in the `data.csv` file or created with custom R code.
        custom_R_code: A field where additional R code can be included. This allows for custom manipulation of the data in the submitted spreadsheet into a different format for easy integration with AusTraits. `.na` indicates no custom R code was used.
    traits:
      description: A translation table mapping traits and units from a contributed study onto corresponding variables in AusTraits. Also specified here are methods used to collect the data.
      type: array
      elements:
        var_in: Name of trait in the original data submitted
        unit_in: Units of trait in the original data submitted
        trait_name: *trait_name
        value_type: *value_type
        replicates: *replicates
        methods: *methods
    substitutions:
      description: A list of any "find and replace" substitutions needed to get the data into the right format.
      type: array
      values:
        trait_name: Trait where substitutions are required
        find: Contributor's trait value that needs to be changed
        replace: AusTraits supported replacement value
    taxonomic_updates:
      description: A table of taxonomic name changes needed to align original names in dataset with taxa in APC and APNI.
      type: array
      values:
        find: *orginal_name
        replace: *taxon_name
        reason: Records why the change was implemented, e.g. `typos`, `taxonomic synonyms`, and `standardising spellings`
    exclude_observations:
      description: A table of observations to remove from compilation
      type: array
      values:
        variable: A variable from the traits table, typically `taxon_name`, `site_name` or `context_name`
        find: Value of variable to remove
        reason: Records why the data was removed, e.g. `exotic`
    questions: A place to record any queries we have about the dataset (recorded as a named array), including notes on any additional traits that may have been collected in the study but have not been incorporated into AusTraits.
