        year_collected_end: &year_collected_end The year data collection was completed.
        description: &description One sentence describing the purpose of the study.
        collection_type: &collection_type A field to indicate where the plants on which traits were sampled were collected -  in the `field`, `lab`, `glasshouse`, or `herbarium specimens`, or `literature`. The latter should only be used when the data were sourced from the literature and the collection type is unknown. 
        sample_age_class: &sample_age_class A field to indicate if study completed on `adult` or `juvenile` plants.
        sampling_strategy: &sampling_strategy A written description of how study sites were selected and how study individuals were selected. When available, this information is lifted verbatim from a published manuscript. For herbarium studies, this field ideally indicates which herbaria were 'sampled' to measure a specific trait.
        source_primary: &source_primary The original study in which data were collected.
        source_secondary: &source_secondary A subsequent study where data were compiled or re-analysed and then made available.
    excluded_data: 
      description: A table of data that did not pass quality test and so were excluded from the master dataset.
      type: character
      value: Structure is identical to that presented in the `data` table, only with an extra column called `error` indicating why the record was excluded.
    species_list:
      description: A table containing details on species taxonomy associated with information in `data`. Cross referencing between the two dataframes is possible using combinations of the variables `species_name`. We have attempted to align species names with known taxonomic units, focussing primarily on the [`The Plant List` (TPL)](http://www.theplantlist.org/) -- a global working list of all known plant species. In addition we have tried to align these names with the [`Australian Plant Census` (APC)](https://biodiversity.org.au/nsl/services/apc) and the [`Australian Plant Names Index` (APNI)](https://biodiversity.org.au/nsl/services/APNI).
      type: table
      elements:
        species_name: *species_name
        family: Family of aligned species_name
        authority: Authority for aligned species_name
        TPL_ID: ID of species in the TPL
        status: Status of species in TPL
        APC_name: Name of species in APC
        APC_ID: ID of species in the APC
        APNI_ID: ID of species in the APNI
    metadata: 
      description: &metadata Structured recording of metadata for each individual study, as entered into Austraits. Information included in `context` and `details` are derived from this file. Also includes information on mapping of trait data into standard terms and units, plus any taxonomic changes implemented.
      type: character
      value: A structured yaml object, represented as a list in R. See section metadata for more details.
    definitions: 
      description: A copy of the definitions for all tables and terms. Information included here was used to process data and generate any documentation for the study.
      type: character
      value: A structured yaml file, represented as a list in R. See file `config/definitions.yaml` for more details.
    session_info: 
      description: The versions of R, packages, and data used to generate the dataset.
      type: character
      value: A structured yaml file, represented as a list in R.
