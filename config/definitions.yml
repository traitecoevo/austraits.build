        observation_id: A unique identifier for the observation, useful for joining traits coming from the same observation_id. Observation ids are assigned automatically, based on `dataset_id` and row number in the file `data.csv`.
        trait_name: &trait_name Name of trait sampled. Allowable values specified in the table `traits`.
        value: &value Value of trait sampled. In the master dataset these are all stored as characters, then converted to numeric later where appropriate.

        replicates: &replicates Number of replicate measurements that comprise the data points for the trait for each measurement. A numeric value (or range) is ideal and appropriate if the value type is a `mean`, `median`, `min` or  `max`. For these value types, if replication is unknown the entry should be `unknown`. If the value type is `raw_value` the replicate value should be `1`. If the value type is `expert_mean`, `expert_min`, or `expert_max` the replicate value should be `.na`.

The latter should only be used when the data were sourced from the literature and the collection type is unknown. 
        sample_age_class: &sample_age_class A field to indicate if the study was completed on `adult` or `juvenile` plants
        sampling_strategy: &sampling_strategy A written description of how study sites were selected and how study individuals were selected.

        primary: &source_primary The original study in which data were collected
        secondary: &source_secondary A subsequent study where data were compiled or re-analysed and then made available
    people:
      description: A list of the key contributors to the study, their respective institutions and roles in the study
      type: array
      elements:
        name: Name of person
        institution: Institution of person
        role:
          description: Person's role in the study
          type: categorical
          values:
            collector: The person (people) leading data collection (up to 2 permitted)
            contributor: Person responsible for entering data into AusTraits
            lab_leader: Leader of lab group at time of collection
            assistant: Anyone else who assisted in collection of the data
            contact: The person to contact with questions about the data set
    dataset:
      description: Details about the study where the data were collected
      type: categorical
      values:
        year_collected_start: *year_collected_start
        year_collected_end: *year_collected_end
        description: *description
        collection_type: *collection_type
        sample_age_class: *sample_age_class
        sampling_strategy: *sampling_strategy
        original_file: The name of the file initially submitted to AusTraits
        notes: Generic notes about the study and processing of data
    sites:
      description: A list of study sites and information about each of the study sites where data were collected. A list of sites. Each should include at least three variables - `latitude`, `longitude` and `description`. Additional variables can be included where available. Set to `.na` for herbarium studies and field studies where data values are a mean across many locations.
    contexts:
      description: A list of scenarios sites and contextial information about each of the scenarios where data were collected. A list of contexts. Each should include at least two variables - `context_type` and `description`. Additional variables can be included where available. Set to `.na` as default.
    config:
      description: Information on the format of the submitted data file
      type: character
      elements:
        data_is_long_format: Indicates if the data spreadsheet has a vertical (long) or  horizontal (wide) configuration with `yes` or `no` terminology
        variable_match: Identifies which information is in each column in the file `data.csv`, excluding the actual trait data. One element within `variable_match` must be `species_name`. Datasets with `data_is_long_format` set to `yes` must also identify which column includes data on `value` and `trait_name`. Other allowed values include `date`, `site_name`, `observation_id`, `context_name` if these columns are present in the `data.csv` file or created with custom R code.
        custom_R_code: A field where additional R code can be included. This allows for custom manipulation of the data in the submitted spreadsheet into a different format for easy integration with AusTraits. `.na` indicates no custom R code was used.
    traits:
      description: A translation table mapping traits and units in the original study onto corresponding variables in AusTraits. Also specified here are methods used to collect the data.
      type: array
      elements:
        var_in: Names of trait in the original data submitted
        unit_in: Units of trait in the original data submitted
        trait_name: *trait_name
        value_type: *value_type
        replicates: *replicates
        methods: *methods
    substitutions:
      description: A list of any "find and replace" substitutions needed to get the data to get it into the right format
      type: array
      values:
        trait_name: Name of variable to search
        find: Value to find
        replace: Replacement value
    taxonomic_updates:
      description: A list of taxonomic name changes needed to align with current taxonomy
      type: array
      values:
        find: *orginal_name
        replace: *species_name
        reason: Records why the change was implemented, e.g. `typos`, `taxonomic synonyms`, and `standardising spellings`
    questions: A place to record any queries we have about the dataset (recorded as a named array), including notes on any additional traits that may have been collected in the study but have not been incorporated into AusTraits.
