      type: categorical
      label: Ovary position
      allowed_values_levels:

        three_quarters_inferior: Flower where the receptacle surrounds more than three
          quarters of the ovary.
      comments: The ovary is the part of the gynoecium where the ovules are produced.
        The ovary may be located on the receptacle and thus be positioned above the
        insertion level of the remaining floral organs (i.e., the ovary is superior
        and the flower is hypogynous). Alternatively, the ovary may be embedded in
        the receptacle and therefore be located below the insertion level of the remaining
        floral organs (i.e., the ovary is inferior and the flower is epigynous). Flowers
        with a hypanthium may either have a superior ovary (perigyny; e.g., many Rosaceae)
        or an inferior ovary (epiperigyny). It is also possible that the ovary is
        inferior to a certain degree only, such as half-inferior, if the receptacle
        is surrounding the ovary to its mid-level. Definition and trait values derived

        perianth parts are counted based on merism (e.g., if a calyx has 5 distinct
        sepals and the corolla is entirely fused, then the corolla is often interpreted
        to consist of five fused petals), anatomy (e.g., number of vascular traces),

      comments: Partial fusion was recorded using an approximate number between these
        two extremes (e.g., 0.1 corresponds to basal fusion, 0.5 to fusion along half
        of the length of perianth parts). In case of multiple whorls, this trait records
        within-whorl fusion. For example, if organs within each whorl are fused along
        their entire length, a trait value of 1 is recorded. In cases where organs
        of two whorls are fused into a common tubular structure, such as frequently
        observed in monocots (e.g., Polygonatum), the perianth is considered to be
        fused. If the two (or more) whorls differed in their extent of fusion, a range
        of trait values may be recorded. For example, if the calyx is only basally
        fused, up to 10% of its length, but the corolla is entirely fused, a range
        of 0.1 to 1 is recorded as the trait value for the species. Definition derived

          or more identical sections that, when rotated around the center of the flower
          by some number of degrees, exactly match each other in orientation and shape.
        actinomorphic_strictly_polysymmetric: Polysymmetry, with three or more planes
          of bilateral symmetry.
        actinomorphic_spiral: Perianth lacking a distinct plane of symmetry because
          their perianth parts are spirally arranged.

      comments: This trait is applied to the perianth as a whole. In case of flowers
        with two or more perianth whorls, species are considered actinomorphic if
        all whorls are actinomorphic and as zygomorphic if one or more whorls are
        zygomorphic. Trait is not applicable when the perianth is missing. Definition

      comments: Typically, outer perianth parts are sepaloid and protect the other
        floral organs during floral development, while inner organs are often petaloid
        and play a role in pollinator attraction (Endress, 1994). However, it is also
        possible that all parts are either sepaloid or petaloid but remain differentiated
        in shape, size, and/or texture. In case of spiral perianths, differentiation
        may be continuous (i.e., gradual), whereby two successively initiated organs
        are very similar or only slightly different, while the outermost and innermost
        organs at both ends of the spiral are very different from each other (e.g.,
        Chimonanthus). In the special case of perianths consisting of a single whorl,
        they are scored as undifferentiated. This perianth differentiation trait may
        be seen as both functional (the parting vs. sharing of functions among perianth
        parts) and developmental (the expression of a genetic program for different
        forms of perianth parts vs. a single program for a single type of perianth
        part morphology). Within-whorl differentiation, whereby organs of the same
        whorl take different forms, is common in zygomorphic flowers (e.g., Balsaminaceae,
        Fabaceae, Orchidaceae) but is not taken into account with this trait. This
        trait is not applicable when the perianth is absent. Definition and trait

        staminodial whorls) differ in their extent of filament fusion with the perianth,
        this trait is recorded as a range of values. For example, if the filaments
        of an outermost stamen whorl are fused, up to 90% of their length, but an
        inner whorl only up to 50%, the trait is assigned a range of 0.5 to 0.9. The
        rationale for this is to provide a general trait that allows comparison of
        fusion among all angiosperms. Definition derived from Schoenenberger et al.

      comments: Includes the number of co-occurring carpellodes (sterile carpels)
        because this number is often more easily obtained from the literature than

        gynoecia with complete carpel fusion up to the stigma (e.g., Primula), it
        may be difficult to assess the number of carpels unequivocally. In such cases,
        the number of carpels is scored only if it is well established based on atomical
        or developmental investigations. Similarly, in gynoecia where one or more
        carpels are reduced (e.g., in the pseudomonomerous gynoecia of some Arecaceae,
        Stauffer et al., 2002), the total number of structural carpels is only scored

        axile: Ovules are placed in the angle between carpel flanks in the center
          of the ovary; in syncarpous gynoecia.
        apical: Ovules attach at the top of the ovary; pendulous; in syncarpous gynoecia
          and apocarpous and unicarpellate gynoecia.
        basal: Ovules attach at the base of the ovary; in syncarpous gynoecia and
          apocarpous and unicarpellate gynoecia.
        parietal: Ovules attach to the ovary wall where two carpels meet; in syncarpous
          gynoecia.
        marginal: Ovules attach along the ventral slit; in apocarpous and unicarpellate
          gynoecia.
        free_central: Ovules are attached to a central column that emerges from the
          base of the ovary and protrudes into the non-septate ovary; in syncarpous
          gynoecia.
        laminar: When there is more than one series of ovules at the flanks of a carpel;
          in syncarpous gynoecia and apocarpous and unicarpellate gynoecia.
      comments: In apocarpous and unicarpellate gynoecia, placentation is often described
        as marginal as the ovules are usually attached along the ventral slit (i.e.,
        the zone where the carpel margins become postgenitally closed during carpel
        development). In syncarpous gynoecia there are three main types of placentation,
        1) axile placentation refers to ovaries where the ovules are placed in the
        angle between carpel flanks in the center of the ovary; 2) in ovaries with
        parietal placentation the ovules attach to the ovary wall where two carpels
        meet; 3) in ovaries with free-central placentation the ovules are attached
        to a central column that emerges from the base of the ovary and protrudes
        into the non-septate ovary. It is not unusual that syncarpous gynoecia show
        a transition from proximally axile to a distally parietal placentation (e.g.,
        Polemoniaceae). Basal and apical placentation may occur both in apocarpous/unicarpellate
        and in syncarpous gynoecia. Usually there is one longitudinal series of ovules
        attached to each carpel margin. However, both in apocarpous/unicarpellate
        and in syncarpous gynoecia there may be more than one series of ovules at
        the flanks of a carpel. These latter cases are referred to as laminar (or
        laminar-diffuse) placentation (e.g., in some Nymphaeaceae). A placenta that
        is protruding from its surroundings and has more than two series of ovules
        (either axile or parietal) is called protruding-diffuse. Definition and trait

      comments: Aperture terminology is partly determined by the position of the aperture
        on the pollen grain (either at the pole or at the equator) and pollen grain

      comments: This trait includes measurements of leaves and leaf analogues, including
        leaflets, cladodes, and phyllodes. When a measurement is made on a leaf analogue,
        the tissue measured should be documented as part of the methods or noted as

        be mapped to the trait `leaflet_area`. It is most common for leaf area measurements
        to include the petiole; the measurement methods should indicate if the petiole
        is included in or excluded from the leaf area measurements. For terete leaves,
        leaf area should still be recorded as the 2-dimensional projected area.

        contrast, leaf thickness measurements from the taxonomic literature will usually
        include any veins or midribs, because in this literature leaf thickness is
        generally measured on succulent plants. The `methods` field should document

        plant's life history, such that some researchers will distinguish between
        ephemeral and annual species, and other researchers will group these life
        history categories together under `annual`. In addition, only a subset of
        studies will use the term `short-lived perennial`; the majority will score
        all perennial plants as `perennial`. Rangeland studies and post-fire studies
        are those most likely to score species as `ephemeral` or `short-lived perennial`,
        as these are environments where perennial species' lifespans are often divided
        into those that are short-lived due to environmental conditions and those
        that are able to persist through the environmentally unfavourable period.

        mineral nutrition and/or water directly from another plant (its host) in an
        interaction that does not benefit the host plant.
      comments: Plants described as parasitic in the context of this trait always
        have haustoria, specialised organs that penetrate the host plants's vascular
        bundles. The trait `root_structures` documents symbiotic relationships with
        fungi. The trait `plant_energy_acquisition_strategy` documents specialised
        strategies or specialised organs or tissues plants use to obtain carbon or
        mineral nutrition.

          not distinguish between obligate hemiparasites, plants which require a host
          for at least part of their life cycle, and facultative hemiparasites, plants
          which can grow and reproduce without a host.
        hemiparasitic_obligate: Plant that is photosynthetic but requires a host for
          at least part of its life cycle.
        hemiparasitic_facultative: Plant that is photosynthetic and can grow and reproduce
          without a host but augments its energy, mineral nutrition, and /or water

        holoparasitic: Plant that obtains all (or nearly all) of its energy through
          parasitism.
        parasitic: Plant that obtains some energy, mineral nutrition and/or water
          through parasitism. This term is used if a dataset does not specify if a
          plant is a hemiparasite or a holoparasite.
        not_parasitic: In the context of this trait, a plant that does not acquire
          energy, mineral nutrition, and/or water via haustoria connected to another
          plant. It can include species that form a symbiosis, including a parasitic
          interaction, with a fungal partner.

      comments: Although the majority of vascular plants use photosynthesis to produce
        their own carbohydrates, this trait mostly includes data for the few taxa
        that are not photosynthetic. Likewise, it captures alternative nutrient acquisition
        strategies. See also the trait `parasitic` which captures data on whether
        plants are parasitic (or partially parasitic), forming haustoria to penetrate
        their host plant. The trait `root_structures` includes specialised root structures

        different components of a whole plant's shape [PATO:0000052] and structure
        [PATO:0000141] into general groups [NCIT:C43359]. Characters that contribute
        to the plant form categories include the height [PATO:0000119] of the vegetative
        shoot system [PO:0025607], the distribution of leaves [PO:0025034] along the
        plant stem [PO:0009047], and the position [PATO:0000140] and count [NCIT:C25463]
        of stems and/or leaves relative to the ground surface.; The form of a plant,
        capturing a general sense of plant height and shape, which parts of a plant
        are woody versus herbaceous, the number of stems arising at ground level,
        and the distribution of leaves relative to the main stem.
      comments: This definition of plant growth form is narrower than what is used
        by many other references. Here, information pertaining to where a plant grows
        is captured by `plant_growth_substrate`. Terminology about the shape and length
        of stems and distribution of leaves is included in `stem_growth_habit`. An
        indication of whether a plant is parasitic is presented in `parasitic`. Included
        in the list of plant growth forms are two terms that are exclusively used
        to describe Australian plants, mallee and hummock, and one, tussock, that
        is an important growth form of Australian grasses, but globally used less
        frequently.
      type: categorical
      label: Plant growth form
      allowed_values_levels:
        herb: A seed-bearing plant which does not have a woody above-ground stem;
          when available this term has been divided into more detailed terms. (Synonyms,
          forb)
        subshrub: A plant that is only woody at the base, with the remainder of the
          stems regenerating yearly. This term is not meant to encompass short-lived
          plants that are only borderline woody. (Synonyms, suffrutescent)
        shrub: A woody plant that is distinguished by NOT being a tree, due to one
          of more of the following characteristics, 1) they are less than 8 metres
          in height; 2) if a plant community includes trees, the shrubs are shorter
          than the surrounding trees and not part of the canopy; 3) in comparison
          to trees, the leaves are more distributed along the entire trunk; 4) the
          plant has multiple relatively narrow stems arising at or near ground level.
          The definition of `shrub` is complex, as there are many single-stemmed shrubs
          within Australia and many taxa that are described in the taxonomic literature
          as a shrub or small tree.
        mallee: Refers to Eucalyptus species which are small trees that form a large
          lignotuber. They have multiple stems arising at or near ground level and
          regenerate from the lignotuber following fire.
        tree: A tall, woody, perennial plant, usually with a single main trunk, and
          its leaves predominantly elevated above the ground surface.
        graminoid: Herbaceous plant with a grass-like morphology that is within the
          order Poales. Taxa both with and without a tussock form are mapped to this
          term. This term is most frequently applied to three large monocot families,
          Poaceae, Cyperaceae, and Juncaceae, but the term could apply to other taxa
          within Poales with a grass-like morphology, including narrow, linear leaves
          and non-showy flowers, including Restionaceae, Centrolepidaceae, Anarthriaceae,
          and Ecdeiocoleaceae. Taxa outside Poales with a grass-like morphology should
          be designated as `herbs` and also have the term `tufted` mapped to the trait
          `stem_growth_habit`.
        tussock: A subcategory of graminoid, which is a plant where many shoots from
          the basal meristem form prominent tufts.
        graminoid_not_tussock: A subcategory of graminoid, indicating a plant which
          explicitly lacks a tussock morphology, with the leaves not growing in tufts.
        hummock: Plant that grows as a dense mound up to 1 metre in height. The term
          generally applies only to species within the genera Triodia that form such
          mounds and these are considered a distinctive and uniquely Australian growth
          form.
        basal_large: A plant whose leaves form a distinctly large basal tuft or rosette,
          including large acaulescent monocots and cycads.
        geophyte: Subcategory of herb, specifically referring to plants that survive
          the winter/dry season as an organ (rhizome, bulb, corm, or tuber) buried
          in dry soil, with all leaves dying back each year.
        palmoid: Plant that bears a rosette-like canopy of typically large, often
          compound leaves atop a usually thick (pachycaulous), columnar, unbranched
          or little-branched stem. Palms, tree ferns, trunked cycads, trunked grass-trees,
          and Pandanus are mapped to this term. (Synonyms, rosette-tree, palm, grass-tree)
        climber: Plant that climbs up another plant's stem or branches, rather than
          being able to support itself. Term used only if datasets do not specify
          if a climbing plant is herbaceous (a vine) or woody (a liana).
        climber_herbaceous: Herbaceous plant that climbs up another plant's stem or
          branches, rather than being able to support itself. This is usually synonymous
          with `vine`. Types of climbers (scrambling, twining) are captured under
          the trait `plant_climbing_mechanism`. (Synonyms, vine)
        climber_woody: Woody or thick-stemmed (>2 cm) plant that climbs up another
          plant's stem or branches, rather than being able to support itself. This
          is usually synonymous with `liana`. Woody climbers generally use hooks,
          tendrils, and/or adventitious roots to climb; the climbing mechanisms used
          by a taxon are captured under the trait `plant_climbing_mechanism`. (Synonyms,
          liana)
        fern: A taxonomic grouping; ferns are vascular plants that reproduce via spores.
        lycophyte: A taxonomic grouping that includes quillworts, clubmosses, and
          selaginella.

        whether any plant tissues [CARO:0000043] are succulent [FLOPO:0900041], indicating
        they are thick [PATO:0000591] and fleshy [PATO:0002351], generally storing
        water [CHEBI:15377] as a drought tolerance [TO:0000276] adaptation or filling
        with water as a salt tolerance [TO:0006001] adaptation.; Trait indicating
        whether the leaves or stems of a plant are thick and fleshy because they store
        water, generally an adaptation to arid or salty environments.
      comments: Succulence generally has either a water storage function or is a mechanism
        to cope with (or thrive in) saline conditions. See the categorical trait `plant_tolerance_salt`
        for plant salt tolerance and salt avoidance strategies and the numeric trait
        `plant_tolerance_soil_salinity` for the soil salinity a plant can tolerate.

        hemiepiphyte: A plant that spends part of its life cycle as an epiphyte, growing
          upon another plant.
      comments: Although the majority of vascular plants are `terrestrial`, for most
        taxonomic groups `plant growth substrate` is only recorded if a plant is not
        terrestrial. The exceptions are ferns and orchids, where both floras and individual
        researchers tend to specifically indicate which taxa are terrestrial. The
        values under this trait are recorded as part of `plant growth form` by many
        researchers, trait handbooks, and databases; they have been split out here,
        as the terms capturing what a plant is attached to do not generally describe
        the form of a plant.

        a population or across a taxon. The trait should only be scored for self-supporting
        plants, not climbers whose height is dependent on the surrounding vegetation.
        The documented height should be the maximum height achieved by vegetative

      comments: The trait `soil_salinity_tolerance` documents actual soil salinity
        levels taxa can tolerate. The trait `plant_type_by_resource_use` has some
        overlapping values, but focuses on terms to describe a plant's overall resource
        tolerances/requirements, while this trait focuses on terms associated with
        salinity tolerances/requirements. The trait `plant_tolerance_soil_salinity`
        offers numeric soil salinity levels a taxon can tolerate.

        is expected that some observations in AusTraits mapped onto ‘seed_dry_mass'

      comments: The trait values indicate the approximate shape of the seed, acknowledging
        few seeds are exactly ellipsoid, globoid, etc. The list of terms has been
        chosen to represent different length:width:height ratios and different levels
        of symmetry. Terms that suggest very specific shapes have generally been grouped
        into a broader category for increased interoperability across datasets.

      comments: This trait is always meant to be measured at "breast height", 1.4
        m above the ground surface. However, for short plants this will not always
        be the case, so it is advised to read the methods to confirm at what height
        plant diameters have been recorded. This trait is not meant to document the
        DBH of all individuals sampled, but instead the maximum DBH for a typical
        mature individual within a population or across a taxon.

        vessels to hydraulic conductivity [EnvThes:22133] as described by the Hagen-Poiseuille
        equation [hupson:SCAIVPH_00000131] .; Hydraulic diameter (or hydraulically
        weighted diameter) is a weighted arithmetic mean diameter of xylem vessels
        in a stem, reflecting the greater contribution of wide vessels to actual hydraulic
        conductivity. It is based on the Hagen-Poiseuille law, a fluid dynamics equation
        that describes laminar flow through a tube. It shows that a few large conduits
        transport an equal amount of water as many small ones, as flow rate is proportional
        to the 4th power of the conduit's diameter.

        indicates whether the plant stem [PO:0009047] (the vegetative shoot system
        [PO:0025607]) is woody, with “woody” defined to include both plant stems with
        secondary xylem (true wood) [PO:0005848] and those with wood-like lignification
        [CHEBI:6457] (woodiness in monocots and ferns).; A binary trait, indicating
        whether a plant's stems are woody, with woody broadly defined to include both
        `true wood` (secondary xylem) and taxa that do not produce secondary xylem
        (i.e. monocots and ferns) but have thick, stiff, robust lignified stems.
      comments: This trait considers all species that have stiff lignified stems as
        `woody` and those that lack such stems as `herbaceous`. See the trait `plant
        woodiness detailed` for sub-categories of `woody` that indicate the extent
        and type of woodiness present in a plant stem.

      comments: This trait documents in detail the degree and type of lignification
        in a plant's stems and roots (woodiness), while `plant woodiness` is a binary
        trait collapsing woodiness into a pair of values, `woody` versus `herbaceous`.
        Datasets that only use the terms `woody` versus `herbaceous` are only mapped
        to the binary trait; only datasets that explicitly indicate different levels
        of woodiness are mapped to `plant woodiness detailed`.
