There will be additional values mapped as either 'seed_dry_mass' or 'fruit_dry_mass' that are also diaspores, but have identified only as being a 'seed' or 'fruit'. In addition, it is expected that some observations in AusTraits mapped onto 'seed_dry_mass' will actually include both the seed and some dispersal tissue, if the two cannot easily be separated.)

The ovary may be located on the receptacle and thus be positioned above the insertion level of the remaining floral organs (i.e., the ovary is superior and the flower is hypogynous). Alternatively, the ovary may be embedded in the receptacle and therefore be located below the insertion level of the remaining floral organs (i.e., the ovary is inferior and the flower is epigynous). Flowers with a hypanthium may either have a superior ovary (perigyny; e.g., many Rosaceae) or an inferior ovary (epiperigyny). It is also possible that the ovary is inferior to a certain degree only, such as half-inferior, if the receptacle is surrounding the ovary to its mid-level.

    flower_perianth_parts_count:
      description: The total number of perianth parts, including sepals, petals, or any form of tepal. A value of zero was scored when the perianth is absent. In flowers with perianth whorls fused along their complete length (e.g., Convolvulus), perianth parts are counted based on merism (e.g., if a calyx has 5 distinct sepals and the corolla is entirely fused, then the corolla is often interpreted to consist of five fused petals), anatomy (e.g., number of vascular traces), development (e.g., number of primordia), or comparison with closely related taxa.

    flower_perianth_fusion:
      description: Fusion of perianth organs (congenital or postgenital) at anthesis, recorded on a continuous scale, from 0 (free parts) to 1 (parts fused along their entire length). Partial fusion was recorded using an approximate number between these two extremes (e.g., 0.1 corresponds to basal fusion, 0.5 to fusion along half of the length of perianth parts). In case of multiple whorls, this trait records within-whorl fusion. For example, if organs within each whorl are fused along their entire length, a trait value of 1 is recorded. In cases where organs of two whorls are fused into a common tubular structure, such as frequently observed in monocots (e.g., Polygonatum), the perianth is considered to be fused. If the two (or more) whorls differed in their extent of fusion, a range of trait values may be recorded. For example, if the calyx is only basally fused, up to 10% of its length, but the corolla is entirely fused, a range of 0.1 to 1 is recorded as the trait value for the species.

Trait is not applicable when the perianth is missing. (Definition and trait values derived from Schoenenberger et al. (2020)  for their character '207. Symmetry of perianth (D1)')

      description: Perianth phyllotaxis at anthesis. Perianth parts may be organised in one or more whorls or along a continuous spiral, usually with wide divergence angles more or less equal to 137.5 degrees. Less frequently, perianth phyllotaxis may be irregular. Perianth phyllotaxis at anthesis may differ from phyllotaxis of perianth part primordia at their inception and it is not uncommon that spirally initiated perianths become whorled later through development.

    flower_perianth_differentiation:
      description: The ways in which perianth organs may look different from each other in a given flower. Typically, outer perianth parts are sepaloid and protect the other floral organs during floral development, while inner organs are often petaloid and play a role in pollinator attraction (Endress, 1994). However, it is also possible that all parts are either sepaloid or petaloid but remain differentiated in shape, size, and/or texture. In case of spiral perianths, differentiation may be continuous (i.e., gradual), whereby two successively initiated organs are very similar or only slightly different, while the outermost and innermost organs at both ends of the spiral are very different from each other (e.g., Chimonanthus). In the special case of perianths consisting of a single whorl, they are scored as undifferentiated. This perianth differentiation trait may be seen as both functional (the parting vs. sharing of functions among perianth parts) and developmental (the expression of a genetic program for different forms of perianth parts vs. a single program for a single type of perianth part morphology). Within-whorl differentiation, whereby organs of the same whorl take different forms, is common in zygomorphic flowers (e.g., Balsaminaceae, Fabaceae, Orchidaceae) but is not taken into account with this trait. This trait is not applicable when the perianth is absent. (Definition and trait values derived from Schoenenberger et al. (2020)  for their character '234. Perianth differentiation (D1)')

Shape is considered in terms of length and width and is defined in relation to anther length/width. The width of the filament may thus either be broad as in laminar (e.g., Eupomatiaceae) or bulky stamens (e.g., Chloranthaceae), or narrow (filamentous) as found in many core eudicots groups (e.g., Rosaceae). This trait is considered inapplicable when filaments are entirely fused with each other or to the perianth. (Definition and trait values derived from Schoenenberger et al.

Partial fusion is recorded using an approximate number between these two extremes (e.g., 0.1 corresponds to basal fusion, 0.5 to fusion along half of the length of filaments).

Partial fusion is recorded using an approximate number between these two extremes (e.g., 0.1 corresponds to basal fusion, 0.5 to fusion along half of the length of perianth parts). If two (or more) stamen whorls (including staminodial whorls) differ in their extent of filament fusion with the perianth, this trait is recorded as a range of values. For example, if the filaments of an outermost stamen whorl are fused, up to 90% of their length, but an inner whorl only up to 50%, the trait is assigned a range of 0.5 to 0.9. The rationale for this is to provide a general trait that allows comparison of fusion among all angiosperms. (Definition derived from Schoenenberger et al. (2020)  for their character '308.

They normally have four microsporangia (pollen sacs) that are arranged pair-wise in two thecae. The two microsporangia of a theca usually release their pollen grains through a common opening (stomium). Often, it is difficult to establish anther orientation clearly in a flower as this is a gradual feature with many intermediate stages. (Definition and trait values derived from Schoenenberger et al.

      description: Number of fertile or sterile carpels in bisexual or female flowers, recorded as a continuous character (with integer values of 1 and above). Includes the number of co-occurring carpellodes (sterile carpels) because this number is often more easily obtained from the literature than the actual number of fertile carpels. However, the number of carpellodes in male flowers is ignored for this character. In multicarpellate, unilocular gynoecia with complete carpel fusion up to the stigma (e.g., Primula), it may be difficult to assess the number of carpels unequivocally. In such cases, the number of carpels is scored only if it is well established based on anatomical or developmental investigations. Similarly, in gynoecia where one or more carpels are reduced (e.g., in the pseudomonomerous gynoecia of some Arecaceae, Stauffer et al., 2002), the total number of structural carpels is only scored when unequivocally determined in the literature.

    flower_gynoecium_placentation:
      description: The different types of placentation in apocarpous/unicarpellate and in syncarpous gynoecia. In apocarpous and unicarpellate gynoecia, placentation is often described as marginal as the ovules are usually attached along the ventral slit (i.e., the zone where the carpel margins become postgenitally closed during carpel development). In syncarpous gynoecia there are three main types of placentation, 1) axile placentation refers to ovaries where the ovules are placed in the angle between carpel flanks in the center of the ovary; 2) in ovaries with parietal placentation the ovules attach to the ovary wall where two carpels meet; 3) in ovaries with free-central placentation the ovules are attached to a central column that emerges from the base of the ovary and protrudes into the non-septate ovary. It is not unusual that syncarpous gynoecia show a transition from proximally axile to a distally parietal placentation (e.g., Polemoniaceae). Basal and apical placentation may occur both in apocarpous/unicarpellate and in syncarpous gynoecia. Usually there is one longitudinal series of ovules attached to each carpel margin. However, both in apocarpous/unicarpellate and in syncarpous gynoecia there may be more than one series of ovules at the flanks of a carpel. These latter cases are referred to as laminar (or laminar-diffuse) placentation (e.g., in some Nymphaeaceae). A placenta that is protruding from its surroundings and has more than two series of ovules (either axile or parietal) is called protruding-diffuse.

When a measurement is made on a leaf analogue, the tissue measured should be documented as part of the methods or noted as a `context` or under `measurement_remarks`. Leaflet area can alternatively be mapped to the trait `leaflet_area`. It is most common for leaf area measurements to include the petiole; the measurement methods should indicate if the petiole is included in or excluded from the leaf area measurements. For terete leaves, leaf area should still be recorded as the 2-dimensional projected area.

It is the width measure that will be reported in taxonomic treatments. It is not the `effective_leaf_width`, a trait that records the diameter of the largest circle that can be drawn within the leaf lamina. If a leaf analogue (leaflet, cladode, or phyllode) is measured instead of a true leaf, this should be noted as a `context` or under `measurement_remarks`.

      description: The form of a plant, capturing a general sense of plant height and shape, which parts of a plant are woody versus herbaceous, the number of stems arising at ground level, and the distribution of leaves relative to the main stem.
      notes: This definition of plant growth form is narrower than what is used by many other references. Here, information pertaining to where a plant grows is captured by `plant_growth_substrate`. Terminology about the shape and length of stems and distribution of leaves is included in `stem_growth_habit`. An indication of whether or not a plant is parasitic is presented in `parasitic`. Included in the list of plant growth forms are two terms that are exclusively used to describe Australian plants, mallee and hummock, and one, tussock, that is an important growth form of Australian grasses, but globally used less frequently.
      type: categorical
      label: Plant growth form
      allowed_values_levels:
        herb: A seed-bearing plant which does not have a woody above-ground stem; when available this term has been divided into more detailed terms. (synonym, forb)
        subshrub: A plant that is only woody at the base, with the remainder of the stems regenerating yearly. This term is not meant to encompass short-lived plants that are only borderline woody. (synonym, suffrutescent)
        shrub: A woody plant that is distinguished by NOT being a tree, due to one of more of the following characteristics, 1) they are less than 8 metres in height; 2) if a plant community includes trees, the shrubs are shorter than the surrounding trees and not part of the canopy; 3) in comparison to trees, the leaves are more distributed along the entire trunk; 4) the plant has multiple relatively narrow stems arising at or near ground level. The definition of `shrub` is complex, as there are many single-stemmed shrubs within Australia and many taxa that are described in the taxonomic literature as a shrub or small tree.
        mallee: Refers to Eucalyptus species which are small trees that form a large lignotuber. They have multiple stems arising at or near ground level and regenerate from the lignotuber following fire.
        tree: A tall, woody, perennial plant, usually with a single main trunk, and its leaves predominately elevated above the ground surface.
        graminoid: Herbaceous plant with a grass-like morphology that is within the order Poales. Taxa both with and without a tussock form are mapped to this term. This term is most frequently applied to three large monocot families, Poaceae, Cyperaceae, and Juncaceae, but the term could apply to other taxa within Poales with a grass-like morphology, including narrow, linear leaves and non-showy flowers, including Restionaceae, Centrolepidaceae, Anarthriaceae, and Ecdeiocoleaceae. Taxa outside Poales with a grass-like morphology should be designated as `herbs` and also have the term `tufted` mapped to the trait `stem_growth_habit`.
        tussock: A subcategory of graminoid, which is a plant where many shoots from the basal meristem form prominent tufts.
        graminoid_not_tussock: A subcategory of graminoid, indicating a plant which explicitly lacks a tussock morphology, with the leaves not growing in tufts.
        hummock: Plant that grows as a dense mound up to 1 metre in height. The term generally applies only to species within the genera Triodia that form such mounds and these are considered a distinctive and uniquely Australian growth form.
        basal_large: A plant whose leaves form a distinctly large basal tuft or rosette, including large acaulescent monocots and cycads.
        geophyte: Subcategory of herb, specifically referring to plants that survive the winter/dry season as an organ (rhizome, bulb, corm, or tuber) buried in dry soil, with all leaves dying back each year.
        palmoid: Plant that bears a rosette-like canopy of typically large, often compound leaves atop a usually thick (pachycaulous), columnar, unbranched or little-branched stem. Palms, tree ferns, trunked cycads, trunked grass-trees, and Pandanus are mapped to this term. (synonym, rosette-tree, palm, grass-tree) 
        climber: Plant that climbs up another plant's stem or branches, rather than being able to support itself. Term used only if datasets do not specify if a climbing plant is herbaceous (a vine) or woody (a liana).
        climber_herbaceous: Herbaceous plant that climbs up another plant's stem or branches, rather than being able to support itself. This is usually synonymous with `vine`. Types of climbers (scrambling, twining) are captured under the trait `plant_climbing_mechanism`. (synonym, vine) 
        climber_woody: Woody or thick-stemmed (>2 cm) plant that climbs up another plant's stem or branches, rather than being able to support itself. This is usually synonymous with `liana`. Woody climbers generally use hooks, tendrils, and/or adventitious roots to climb; the climbing mechanisms used by a taxon are captured under the trait `plant_climbing_mechanism`. (synonym, liana)
        fern: A taxonomic grouping; ferns are vascular plants that reproduce via spores.
        lycophyte: A taxonomic grouping that includes quillworts, clubmosses, and selaginella.
    plant_succulence:
      description: Trait characterising whether the leaves or stems of a plant are thick and fleshy because they store water, generally an adaptation to arid or salty environments.
      notes: Succulence generally has either a water storage function or is a mechanism to cope with (or thrive in) saline conditions. See the trait `salt tolerance` for detailed variation in plant salt tolerance and salt avoidance strategies.

        semi-succulent: A plant has tissues that are somewhat thick and fleshy, including many chenopods.
        not_succulent: Neither stems nor leaves are thick and fleshy.
    stem_growth_habit:
      description: Trait characterising a stem's structure and 3-dimensional extent, including the position of stems, degree of branchiness, density of branches, and branch angles relative to other branches and the ground surface.
      notes: This trait captures how a plant explores 3-dimensional space, with trait values predominantly adjectives that modify the core plant growth forms.

        cushion-forming: Multiple erect, short stems arise from the soil and are so tightly packed that they form dense, even, rounded canopy with no gaps. (synonym, cushion) 
        mat-forming: Multiple stems that are mostly horizontal and are densely packed, but open enough that there are still a few gaps between them.
        tufted: Plant has a dense clump of leaves, either at the base of the plant or clusters of leaves growing close together higher on the plant. This term can refer to grasses, shrubs, or trees. 
        creeping: Stem that creeps along the ground, rooting at nodes. (synonym, repent)
        decumbent: Stems whose bases lie flat on the ground, but whose tips grow upward. (synonym, ascending)
        prostrate: Stems lie flat on the ground but do not root at nodes (synonym, procumbent, reclining, trailing)
        rosette: Plants whose leaves radiate from a central point at or near ground level. (synonym, acaulescent, rosulate)
        climbing: Stem that does not have a self-supporting structure and ascends by leaning on or attaching itself to surrounding vegetation or another substrate. Climbing mechanisms include tendrils, petioles, adventitious roots, scrambling, and twining and are distinguished between in the trait `plant_climbing_mechanism`.
        sprawling: Stem that sprawls across other plants or objects, but lacks specialised climbing structures or mechanisms.(synonym, clambering, scandent)
        rhizomatous: Plants with short horizontal underground stems from which shoots emerge.
        stoloniferous: Plants with long horizontal branches either slightly belowground or aboveground, that root at their nodes or tips, producing new plants. (synonym, sarmentose)
        spreading: Plants with a notable horizontal extent, referring either to a broad tree canopy or a shrub or herb that spreads across the ground.

      notes: Leaf mass per area includes measurements submitted as `specific_leaf_area` (SLA); they are simply inverted. Leaf mass per area is explicitly measured on an entire leaf, including the petiole. Measurements made on a piece of the leaf lamina, excluding petiole and midrib, are a separate trait `leaf_lamina_mass_per_area`. If measurements are made on the entire leaf lamina, but the petiole is excluded, this should be noted in the methods or under `measurement_remarks`.

    woodiness:
      description: A binary trait, indicating whether or not a plant’s stems are woody, with woody broadly defined to include both `true wood` (secondary xylem) and taxa that do not produce secondary xylem (i.e. monocots and ferns) but have thick, stiff, robust lignified stems.
      notes: This trait considers all species that have stiff lignified stems as `woody` and those that lack such stems as `herbaceous`. See the trait `plant woodiness detailed` for sub-categories of `woody` that indicate the extent and type of woodiness present in a plant stem
      type: categorical
      label: Woodiness
      allowed_values_levels:
        herbaceous: Plant with non-lignified stems.
        woody: Plant whose stems are stiff and lignified, including both stems that produce secondary xylem and those that produce only lignified primary tissues but are notably stiff and robust.
    woodiness_detailed:
      description: A variable to indicate the extent, distribution, and type of secondary xylem (true wood) and wood-like lignification (woodiness in monocots and ferns) in stems, roots, and reproductive shoots.
      notes: This trait documents in detail the degree and type of lignification in a plant's stems and roots (woodiness), while `plant woodiness` is a binary trait collapsing woodiness into a pair of values, `woody` versus `herbaceous`. Datasets that only use the terms `woody` versus `herbaceous` are only mapped to the binary trait; only datasets that explicitly indicate different levels of woodiness are mapped to `plant woodiness detailed`. 
      type: categorical
      label: Detailed woodiness categories
      allowed_values_levels:
        herbaceous: Plant with non-lignified stems.
        woody: Plant whose stems produce secondary xylem (true wood).
        woody_base: Plant where secondary xylem (true wood) is present only at the base of stems. (synonym, suffrutescent)
        woody_root: Plant that has a woody rootstock, but non-woody above-ground stems.
        semi_woody: Plant that forms stems considered only "partially woody", generally having lower lignin and cellulose contents and possibly not forming secondary xylem. These are generally short-lived, fast-growing stems. (synonym, green-stem shrub, soft shrub, soft wood)
        woody_like_stem: Taxa, including monocots and ferns, that produce thick, stiff, robust lignified stems, but do not produce secondary xylem.
        woody_like_inflorescence: Taxa, including monocots and ferns, that produce thick, stiff, robust lignified inflorescence shoots, but are otherwise non-woody.
