# Contributing to austraits.build

We envision AusTraits as an on-going collaborative community resource that:

1. Increases our collective understanding of the Australian flora;
2. Facilitates accumulating and sharing of trait data;
3. Aspires to fully transparent and reproducible research of highest standard, and 
4. Builds a sense of community among contributors and users.

We'd love for you to contribute. You can read more about the ways you can contribute on our website.
