  description: Investigation into trait values correlated with plant height along
    light availability and successional gradients for far north Queensland species.
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: Nineteen species, ranging from early to late successional status,
    were selected using published sources (Hopkins & Graham 1987; Osunkoya 1996; Hyland
    et al. 1999). Species selected to represent the light gradient establish and mature
    in closed forest, where successional species are assumed absent. For inclusion
    in this set we required that a species was known to establish and persist at low
    light levels, as indicated either by published sources (Hyland et al. 1999; Osunkoya
    1996) or by scientists familiar with the vegetation (A Graham, J Wells, CSIRO
    Atherton; R Jensen). Twenty-six species, experiencing a range of light levels
    at maturity, from high (canopy trees) to low light (understorey shrubs), were
    included.

traits:
- var_in: LMA (mg mm-2)
  unit_in: mg/mm2
  trait_name: specific_leaf_area
  value_type: unknown
  replicates: unknown
  methods: LMA was calculated as the leaf dry mass (oven-dried for 48 hours at 65
    °C) divided by leaf size. It was measured on the first five fully expanded leaves
    at the tip of each individual.
- var_in: Leaf nitrogen (mg mg-1)
  unit_in: mg/mg
  trait_name: leaf_N_per_dry_mass
  value_type: unknown
  replicates: unknown
  methods: Leaves from all individuals per species were pooled and finely ground for
    nitrogen analysis. Total nitrogen concentration (%) was measured using complete
    combustion gas chromatography by Waite Analytical Services, Adelaide. The first
    five fully expanded leaves at the tip of each individual were used for the analysis.
- var_in: leaf size (mm2)
  unit_in: mm2
  trait_name: leaf_area
  value_type: unknown
  replicates: unknown
  methods: Leaf size was calculated as the one-sided leaf area (flat bed scanner).
    It was measured on the first five fully expanded leaves at the tip of each individual.
- var_in: wood density (mg mm-3)
  unit_in: mg/mm3
  trait_name: wood_density
  value_type: unknown
  replicates: unknown
  methods: Wood density was calculated using 40–60 mm stem segments taken 250 mm and
    1000 mm back along a branch from the branch tip. Fresh samples were refrigerated
    before processing. After removing bark material, the volume of each wood sample
    was determined using Archimedes' principle (Hacke et al. 2000). Samples were submerged
    in a water-filled container on a balance. The weight change (mg) recorded during
    submersion corresponds to the mass of water displaced, which can be converted
    to a volume using the formula, displacement weight (mg)/0.998 (mg/mm3), where
    0.998 mg/mm3 is the density of water at 20 °C. Samples were then dried for 4 days
    at 60 °C before weighing.
- var_in: branch mass fraction
  unit_in: dimensionless
  trait_name: branch_mass_fraction
  value_type: unknown
  replicates: unknown
  methods: Branch mass fraction was calculated as the mass side branches/total mass,
    on a carbon dry mass basis.
- var_in: Seed mass (mg)
  unit_in: mg
  trait_name: seed_mass
  value_type: unknown
  replicates: unknown
  methods: Mean oven-dried seed mass (including seed coat but excluding seed accessories)
    was estimated for all species with available field material. In total, collections
    for 17 of 47 species were made. Data for an additional 12 species were drawn from
    published (Osunkoya et al. 1994; Grubb et al. 1998) and unpublished (P. Juniper,
    CSIRO Atherton) sources.
