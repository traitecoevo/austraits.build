  description: Extensive collection of leaf anatomical and morphological trait data
    for Proteaceae
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: 'From Jordan_2008: CHARACTERS AND DATA SOURCES Presence/absence
    characters were scored for species for climatic variables and forms of stomatal
    protection. The climatic characters were scored for all Australian species of
    Proteaceae, except poorly documented ones (1109 species in total). Published descriptions
    and observations of herbarium collections were used to score macroscopic forms
    of protection for the 1109 Australian species, 332 South African species, 42 New
    Caledonian species, 10 South American species, and two New Zealand species of
    the family. Anatomical data were derived from cross sectional anatomy of over
    300 species and from cuticle preparations of over 500 species; From Jordan_2020:
    We also measured epidermal characters from 109 extant species (electronic supplementary
    material, table S4) representing 69 of the 80 genera of Proteaceae, with multiple
    species of large genera. Replicate specimens (measured for most species) indicated
    that within-species variation in epidermal characteristics was small relative
    to among-species variation.'

  trait_name: stomatal_distribution
  entity_type: species
  value_type: mode
  basis_of_value: expert_score
  replicates: .na.character
  methods: Five epidermal characters (electronic supplementary material, table S5
    and figure S1) were estimated on both fossils and extant specimens. Guard cell
    length, a simple, reliable measure of stomatal size on fossils, was measured from
    all specimens. Stomatal density, stomatal index [100 x number of stomata/(number
    of epidermal pavement cells + number of stomata)], pavement cell area and theoretical
    maximum stomatal conductance (gs max) were calculated for most species by site
    combinations, based on an average of up to five specimens. Measurements were made
    from digital micrographs of cuticles, using ImageJ v. 1.48 (National Institutes
    of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA; http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/). gs max was estimated
    following the equation of Parlange & Waggoner [11], assuming that stomatal pore
    length was two-thirds of guard cell length, stomatal pore width was one-third
    of pore length and stomatal pore depth was the same as stomatal pore length. These
    assumptions are consistent with dimensions observed in extant Proteaceae (G.J.J.
    12 December 2015, unpublished data).

  methods: Five epidermal characters (electronic supplementary material, table S5
    and figure S1) were estimated on both fossils and extant specimens. Guard cell
    length, a simple, reliable measure of stomatal size on fossils, was measured from
    all specimens. Stomatal density, stomatal index [100 x number of stomata/(number
    of epidermal pavement cells + number of stomata)], pavement cell area and theoretical
    maximum stomatal conductance (gs max) were calculated for most species by site
    combinations, based on an average of up to five specimens. Measurements were made
    from digital micrographs of cuticles, using ImageJ v. 1.48 (National Institutes
    of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA; http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/). gs max was estimated
    following the equation of Parlange & Waggoner [11], assuming that stomatal pore
    length was two-thirds of guard cell length, stomatal pore width was one-third
    of pore length and stomatal pore depth was the same as stomatal pore length. These
    assumptions are consistent with dimensions observed in extant Proteaceae (G.J.J.

  methods: Dense hairs covering the stomatal regions were defined as the presence
    of a dense layer of hairs obscuring the stomata in fully developed leaves. This
    definition included species with hairs at the apertures of pits, grooves, or closely
    revolute margins. Many other species had immature leaves with hairs that were
    lost at maturity.

  unit_in: .na.character
  trait_name: .na.character
  entity_type: species
  value_type: mode
  basis_of_value: expert_score
  replicates: .na.character
  methods: Presence of tightly revolute margins. In these species, the leaf margins
    were appressed either to each other or to a protruding midrib. The apertures of
    the resulting grooves were lined with hairs in almost all species. A form of deep
    encryption, defined as the presence of an external aperture that is separated
    from the stomatal aperture by at least twice the width of the aperture of the
    crypt, pit, or groove.

    to a series of deep, narrow, hair-lined grooves running the length of the leaf.
    A form of deep encryption, defined as the presence of an external aperture that
    is separated from the stomatal aperture by at least twice the width of the aperture
    of the crypt, pit, or groove.

  methods: The presence of deep pits. In these species, the leaf areoles were deeply
    invaginated, creating a large cavity lined by stomata (Figs. 5, 6). The apertures
    were typically occluded by hairs and ~100 um in diameter, and the cavities were
    often ~300 um in diameter and contained ~40-100 stomata.  A form of deep encryption,
    defined as the presence of an external aperture that is separated from the stomatal
    aperture by at least twice the width of the aperture of the crypt, pit, or groove.

  unit_in: .na.character
  trait_name: .na.character
  entity_type: species
  value_type: mode
  basis_of_value: expert_score
  replicates: .na.character
  methods: Papillose pits were defined to include stomata that were sunken below the
    epidermis and partially covered by large papillae (Figs. 7, 8; see also 27). The
    stomata were typically sunken by 25-40 um, with apertures 25-40 um wide. Some
    other species had stomata slightly sunken (<20 um) below the leaf surface (e.g.,
    Lomatia dentata, Grevillea hilliana) or had somewhat papillose surfaces (e.g.,
    Lambertia echinata, Hakea petiolaris), but these did not form a discrete, clearly
    defined class and had no consistent pattern with climate. They are not considered
    further.
