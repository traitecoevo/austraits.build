  description: data from a study comparing carbon uptake strategies of native versus
    invasive species
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: 'All study sites were located in urban bushland remnants on Hawkesbury
    Sandstone-derived soils in the Sydney region. Average annual rainfall is 1220
    mm. These soils are quartz-rich with well-drained, acidic sandy surface textures,
    and are poor in organic matter and nutrients, particularly P and N (Walker, 1960;
    Williams & Raupach, 1983). Typical vegetation communities supported by these soils
    are dry sclerophyll open forests and woodlands, dominated by species of Eucalyptus,
    Acacia and Banksia (Benson & Howell, 1990). Three site types were surveyed: sites
    adjacent to urban creeks, sites below stormwater outlets, and undisturbed hill-
    slopes. Sites adjacent to urban creeks and stormwater outlets are typically subject
    to nutrient enrichment via stormwater run-off (Leishman, 1990; Leishman et al.,
    2004). The storm- water system transfers run-off from impervious surfaces in urban
    catchments and discharges it at outlets that generally drain into previously dry
    areas of natural bushland at the edge of urban development, or directly into creeks.
    Earlier work has shown that soils receiving stormwater run-offhave average total
    P concentrations of approximately 600 mg kg-1'' compared with background soil
    P concentrations of 40-100 mg kg-'' and are heavily invaded by exotic plants such
    as Ligustrum sinense, Cardiospermum grandiflorum, Lantana camara and Protoasparagus
    aethiopicus (Leishman, 1990; Leishman et al., 2004).'
  original_file: Hawkesbury sandstone data.csv provided directly by Michelle Leishman
    - this file had two workbooks that were joined in excel; 'data_Leishman_2007_from_Richards_2008'
    was part of a compilation by Anna Richards that included mean values for the Hawkesbury
    sandstone data and additional NSW data.
  notes: There is additional information for this study in the Macquarie University library from Tammy Haslehurst's honors thesis. Also, values for Acacia sp. in the file 'Hawkesbury
    sandstone data' match those for 'Acacia parramatensis' in the other data file
    I have. I've manually changed the Acacia sp. to Acacia parramatensis.

  methods: Leaf traits were measured on young to medium-aged, fully expanded outer
    canopy leaves. Ten leaves from each individual were separated for calculation
    of SLA (leaf area/leaf dry weight). Projected leaf area was determined with a
    flatbed scanner (HP Desk II scanner) and image analysis software (Delta-T SCAN;
    Delta-T Devices, Cambridge, UK). All leaves were oven-dried at 60'C for 48 h before
    weighing.

    combustion gas chromatography (Howarth, 1977). All foliar nutrient analyses were
    conducted at the Waite Analytical Laboratory, University of Adelaide, Adelaide,
    Australia. Individual measurements were averaged for each species at each site.
