  description: Plant fire response and other related trait data extracted from the
    VicFlora, the Victorian online flora.
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: This dataset is sourced from the VicFlora online website (version
    date 2022-05-06). Briefly, the textual descriptions of each taxon were downloaded
    and organised into a tabular format of individual taxon names and their corresponding
    text using R coding script. Sentences mentioning the words 'burn' or 'fire' were
    extracted and manually scored to match relevant traits in AusTraits. Unclassified
    taxa were inferred, where possible, as possessing a trait value from a higher-level
    taxonomic description, e.g. all taxa in X genus were classified as resprouts,
    which was mentioned only in the genus description. All below-species-level taxa
    were also inferred from species-level values where possible.
