  methods: Seeds were assumed to be ellipsoids and the volumes calculated for 302 species from measurements of seed length (l), breadth (b) and width (w) (volume = pi / 6.1 .b.w). Seed volume ranged from 0.001 mm3 (Drosera bunnaniz) to 93,530 mm3 (Aleurites molucanna) and was log transformed prior to analyses since the distribution was log normal.
