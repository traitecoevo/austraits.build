  description: seed mass reserve data for various species in NSW
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: Seed mass data measured on seeds dissected by Ian Wright & Martin
    Henery, 1998/1999. Seeds sourced from different locations, including Australian
    seed company (ASC), MLF (unknown seed company), Kuringgai National Park (KNP)
    and Round Hill Nature Reserve (RH). Sites are distinguished by the rainfall and
    phosphorus content.
  original_file: component of file Wright & Henery seed mass data.xls that is not
    published in Henery_2001
  notes: As of Feb 13, 2020 this data set combines data that were separated into Wright_2001
    and Westoby_2003. The data under Westoby_2003 were not the same values that appeared
    in the accompanying paper. Lizzy Wenk is making the assumption the data that had
    been under Westoby_2003 are also unpublished and should be part of this dataset_id.
    (Westoby_2003 now refers to a different dataset entirely.) In addition, there
    is a column in the data.csv file with seed provenance.

traits:
- var_in: whole_M (mg)
  unit_in: mg
  trait_name: seed_mass
  value_type: site_mean
  replicates: 6-113
  methods: Seeds were assumed to be ellipsoids and the volumes calculated for 302
    species from measurements of seed length (l), breadth (b) and width (w) (volume
    = pi / 6.1 .b.w). Seed volume ranged from 0.001 mm3 (Drosera bunnaniz) to 93,530
    mm3 (Aleurites molucanna) and was log transformed prior to analyses since the
    distribution was log normal. Replicate count is given as a column in the data.csv
    file.
- var_in: reserve_M (mg)
  unit_in: mg
  trait_name: seed_mass_reserve
  value_type: site_mean
  replicates: 6-113
  methods: Data for seed reserve mass (dry mass of embryo plus endosperm if present)
    were drawn from previous studies in similar vegetation (Leishman et al. 1995;
    Westoby et al. 1990) or from unpublished datasets for western NSW, but none of
    the values are present in other datasets within AusTraits. Replicate count is
    given as a column in the data.csv file.
