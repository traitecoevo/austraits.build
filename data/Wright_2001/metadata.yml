  methods: Seeds were assumed to be ellipsoids and the volumes calculated for 302
    species from measurements of seed length (l), breadth (b) and width (w) (volume
    = pi / 6.1 .b.w). Seed volume ranged from 0.001 mm3 (Drosera bunnaniz) to 93,530
    mm3 (Aleurites molucanna) and was log transformed prior to analyses since the
    distribution was log normal.

taxonomic_updates:
- find: Phyllota phyllicoides
  replace: Phyllota phylicoides
  reason: Spelling mistake identified by TaxonStand (2018-02-08)
- find: Dodonaea viscosa angustissima
  replace: Dodonaea viscosa subsp. angustissima
  reason: Typo - align to known species (D Falster, 2018-02-13)
- find: Dodonaea viscosa cuneata
  replace: Dodonaea viscosa subsp. cuneata
  reason: Typo - align to known species (D Falster, 2018-02-13)
- find: Pittosporum phylliraeoides
  replace: Pittosporum phillyraeoides
  reason: typo, align to known species (S Andrew)
questions:
  contributors: Do you have basic information on the sampling strategy for
    this data? Was it collected at a single site or across many sites? Also, what
    methods were used to collect the seed reserve mass data?
