  description: We examined spatial and temporal patterns of tree water use and aspects
    of hydraulic architecture in four common tree species of central Australia to
    better understand processes that constrain water use in these environments.
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: In this study we have examined patterns of tree water use, leaf
    water potential and aspects of hydraulic architecture at two sites within the
    Ti tree basin- Tin fish Bore (C. opaca, E. victrix and A. aneura) on Stirling
    station and on Woodforde River on Pine Hill Station (E. camaldulensis, A. aneura).
    These two sites were chosen as they encompass the range of habitats common in
    this region of central Australia and represent sites of contrasting depths to
    water table (Tin fish 7 m, Woodforde 40 m). Not all species were present at each
    site; however, both sites contained extensive stands of A. aneura. Field measurements
    undertaken as part of this study were made during two field campaigns in April
    and November 2007. The April field campaign took place between 18 and 25 April,
    during a time of relatively high soil moisture availability. The November field
    campaign took place between 17 and 24 November, after an extended period of little
    or no rainfall, and represented a period of low soil water availability.

traits:
- var_in: Huber_value

  trait_name: huber_value
  entity_type: population
  value_type: mean
  basis_of_value: measurement
  replicates: 4
  methods: Sapwood area to leaf area ratios were determined on two terminal branches
    collected from each tree for which there were concurrent water use and leaf water
    potential measurements. Area under bark was measured on two axis using digital
    callipers. All leaves were stripped from each branch and retained for leaf area
    determination. Approximately five leaves from each branch were scanned for leaf
    area using the scanning software WinRhizo (Regent Instruments, Quebec, Canada).
    Leaves were then dried to constant weight at 65C and SLA of each sample calculated
    from ratio of leaf area to dry weight. The remainder of the leaves from each branch
    were then dried at 65C and the SLA used to calculate branch leaf area by multiplying
    SLA and dry weight of all leaves on each branch. In these trees, heartwood and
    pith colour was distinctly different from sapwood colour and no heartwood was
    observed in these branches. Thus, area under bark was assumed to represent sapwood
    area.

- var_in: Sapwood_density
  unit_in: kg/m3
  trait_name: wood_density
  entity_type: population
  value_type: mean
  basis_of_value: measurement
  replicates: 4
  methods: Replicate measures of sapwood density were made on two to three sample
    branches from each tree. Branch samples ranged in length from 5 to 10 cm, and
    diameter ranged between 3 and 10 mm. Samples were stored in sealed plastic bags
    until processing. In the laboratory, bark was stripped from each sample and the
    sample placed in a beaker of distilled water for up to 24 h to fully saturate.
    Samples were blotted dry and volume determined via Archimedes principle by fully
    immersing the branch sample in a beaker of distilled water placed on a tared electric
    balance. The measured weight of the immersed branch sample was equivalent to volume.
    Each sample was then dried at 80C to constant weight and sapwood density determined
    as the ratio of dry weight to fully saturated volume of the sample.

  unit_in: MPa
  trait_name: water_potential_predawn
  entity_type: population
  value_type: mean
  basis_of_value: measurement
  replicates: 4
  methods: Diurnal patterns of leaf water potential were determined on two leaves
    from each of four trees of each species. Measurements commenced pre-dawn and continued
    at 60 to 90min intervals until dusk. Balancing pressure was determined using a
    Scholander-type pressure bomb (PMS Instruments, Corvallis, OR). Leaves were collected
    from between 3 and 5 m above ground level. All leaves were sampled from the northern
    aspect of the canopy using pole pruners. Leaves were immediately sealed in plastic
    bags to prevent transpiration (Turner and Long 1980) and stored in a dark insulated
    container until measurement, usually within 20 min.

  entity_type: population

  methods: For each species, relationships between diameter at 1.3 m and sapwood area
    were developed. An increment corer was used to determine sapwood thickness and
    sapwood was distinguished from heartwood on the basis of a distinct colour change.
    Additionally, sapwood thickness was determined in up to 20 trees of each of the
    four species to ensure no systematic biases in our determination of sapwood area.
- var_in: Canopy_conductance
  unit_in: mmol/m2/s
  trait_name: .na
  entity_type: population
  value_type: mean
  basis_of_value: measurement
  replicates: 4
  methods: Canopy conductance, expressed on a leaf area basis, was calculated from
    sapflow and vapour pressure deficit following Ewers et al. (2005) Gc= KG(TA)E1
    / D , where KG (TA) is the conductance coefficient as a function of temperature
    (115 Â± 0.4236 (TA) kPa m3 kg-1), which accounts for the temperature effects on
    the psychrometric constant, latent heat of vaporisation, specific heat of air
    at constant pressure and the density of air (Phillips and Oren 1998). TA is air
    temperature (degC), El is transpiration rate per unit leaf area (kg s-1 m-2) and
    D is vapour pressure deficit (kPa). Canopy conductance (m s-1) was converted to
    mmol m-2 s-1 following Pearcy et al. (1989). Canopy conductance calculated in
    this manner assumes that boundary layer conductance is high so that D is close
    to leaf-to-air vapour pressure difference. It also assumes that there are no vertical
    gradients in D throughout the canopy and negligible water stored above the sapflux
    measurement point.
- var_in: soil_to_leaf_hydraulic_conductance
  unit_in: kg/m2/s/MPa
  trait_name: .na
  entity_type: population
  value_type: mean
  basis_of_value: measurement
  replicates: 4
  methods: Soil-to-leaf hydraulic conductance (Kp) was determined from the slope of
    tree water use (expressed on a sapwood area basis, Qs, kg s-1 m-2) and leaf water
    potential (MPa) measurements made throughout the morning (O Grady et al. 2006).
    Comparisons between water use and leaf water potential were made by taking the
    mean of the 15min fluxes from before and after the time leaves were sampled for
    determination of leaf water potential.
