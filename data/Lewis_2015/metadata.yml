  description: Wollemi pine (Wollemia nobilis W.G.Jones, K.D.Hill, & J.M.Allen), formerly
    widespread in Australia, was reduced to a remnant population of fewer than 100
    genetically indistinguishable individuals. Here, we examined the interactive effects
    of three [CO2] (290, 400 and 650 ppm) and two temperature (ambient, ambient +
    4 deg C) treatments on clonally-propagated Wollemi pine grown for 17 months in
    glasshouses under wellwatered and fertilised conditions.

  sampling_strategy: 'Plant material and growth conditions Wollemi pine (Wollemia
    nobilis W.G.Jones, K.D.Hill & J.M. Allen) plants were obtained as one-year-old,
    clonally propagated, potted plants from the Australian Botanic Garden (Mount Annan,
    NSW, Australia). Plants were planted one per pot in 2.4 L plastic pots filled
    with a potting mix consisting of 1.5 : 0.5 : 1 (v/v/v) coir peat, sand and Perlite,
    respectively, supplemented with lime, dolomite, iron sulfate, Micromax and Nutricote
    (N:13; Sungro Horticulture, Bellevue, WA, USA). The plants were randomly assigned
    to six adjacent, naturally sun-lit and temperature-controlled glasshouse compartments.
    Plants were grown under 50% shade cloth to provide optimal light intensities for
    ex situ Wollemi pine growth (Pohio et al. 2005). Pots were watered twice a week
    to through-flow with tap water. During the growing season (December-February),
    pots were watered ~every 6 weeks with Aquasol fertiliser (N: 23%, P: 4%, K:18%,
    Zn: 0.05%, Cu: 0.06%, Mo: 0.0013%, Fe: 0.06%, Bo: 0.01%; Yates Australia, Padstow,
    NSW, Australia) at a concentration of 2 g L-1. Plants were spot sprayed with Confidor
    pesticide (Bayer CropScience, Melbourne, Vic, Australia), at a concentration of
    1 g L-1, when pests (golden mealy bug (Nipaecoccus aurilanatus) and aphids (Aphis
    spp.)) were detected. The six glasshouse bays were separated into six factorial
    combinations of two temperature and three [CO2] regimes. Temperature and [CO2]
    were maintained as described in work by Ghannoum et al. (2010a). In brief, three
    bays tracked local (Richmond, NSW, Australia) ambient temperature (i.e. ambient
    temperature treatment) and three bays were maintained at ambient + 4 deg C (i.e.
    elevated temperature treatment). Air temperature was kept constant during the
    night and midday periods; temperature was stepped up and down in two 4 C steps
    before and after the midday period. Average temperatures for the ambient and elevated
    temperature treatments were 26/18 and 30/22 deg C (day/night) respectively. The
    temperature set point was maintained within +4 deg C and -2 deg C for 100% of
    the time. Within each temperature treatment, bays were automatically regulated
    to maintain pre-industrial (280 ppm), ambient (400 ppm) and elevated (640 ppm)
    [CO2]. Actual average daytime [CO2] during the study period for the pre-industrial,
    ambient and elevated treatments was 290, 400 and 650 ppm respectively. The CO2
    set point was maintained within +/- 20 ppm of the target 82-86% of the time across
    bays. Mixing bottled CO2 with ambient air (d13C ~ -9.83 per mille) resulted in
    a 13CO2 isotopic composition of d13C of about -5.51 per mille and -17.02 per mille
    under pre-industrial and elevated [CO2] respectively. Air d13C corresponded to
    average values determined (for the corresponding treatment) throughout the experiment,
    coinciding with gas exchange analyses. Average vapour pressure deficits in the
    bays over the growing season in the ambient temperature treatment were 1.49, 1.69
    and 1.62 kPa in the pre-industrial, ambient and elevated [CO2] treatments, respectively,
    and in the elevated temperature treatment were 1.17, 1.67 and 1.67 kPa in the
    pre-industrial, ambient and elevated [CO2] treatments respectively. Plants were
    rotated within glasshouse bays on a fortnightly basis and between glasshouse bays
    on a bi-monthly basis to minimise the impact of glasshouse bay environmental variation
    on plant responses to the [CO2] and temperature treatments.'

  methods: ACi response curves were measured 15 months (February 2010) after treatments
    were initiated. Curves were measured on 9-10 plants in each treatment using a
    portable open gas exchange system (LI-6400, Li-Cor Biosciences     Inc.) supplying
    light by a built-in blue and red light-emitting diode source mounted above the
    leaf cuvette (LI-6400-02B). External [CO2] (Ca) was applied after equilibration
    at the ambient growth [CO2] and the cuvette temperature was maintained at 20 deg
    C; Ca was varied 11 times between 75 ppm and 2000 ppm. Measurements were automatically
    recorded at each Ca set-point when photosynthesis had equilibrated, which was
    typically 1-2 min after a stable Ca setpoint had been achieved. Amax (and corresponding
    stomatal conductance) is recorded as the top step in the ACi curve.

    [CO2] x temperature treatment combination. All measurements (except November 2008)
    were made at saturating irradiance (Q, 700 mmolm-2 s-1, 400-700 nm), the target
    growth [CO2], midday growth temperature (26 or 30 deg C) and a leaf-to-air vapour
    pressure deficit (VPD) of 0.9-2.0 kPa, reflecting ambient VPD in the glasshouse
    compartments. Conditions for measurements in November 2008 were the same except
    that irradiance was 1000 mmolm-2 s-1. All measurements (except February 2010)
    were recorded after ~10 min, after photosynthesis had equilibrated. In February
    2010, gas-exchange data at the growth [CO2] were determined from measurements
    of the response of photosynthesis (A) to intercellular [CO2] (Ci) and irradiance

  replicates: 1
  methods: Seventeen months (April 2010) after the initiation of [CO2] and temperature
    treatments, six plants from each of the treatment combinations were harvested
    and separated into leaf and stem tissue. Leaves were further separated into new
    growth, corresponding to leaves produced since the initiation of treatments, and
    initial leaf tissue, corresponding to leaves produced before the initiation of
    treatments. Total projected leaf area of initial leaf tissue and new growth was
    measured using a portable leaf area meter (LI-3100A, Li-Cor Biosciences Inc.,
    Lincoln, NE, USA). Harvested tissue was oven-dried at 70 deg C until completely
    dry (approximately 1 week) and then massed. For each plant, leaf mass per unit
    leaf area (LMA) was calculated as total leaf dry mass/total leaf area. Leaf area
    per unit shoot dry mass (LAR) was calculated as total leaf area/total shoot dry
    mass.

    cm long plastic straws with Optimal Cutting Temperature (O. C. T.) embedding medium
    for frozen tissue (Tissue-Tek, Sakura, USA) and placed in a freezer at -79 deg
    C for ~10 minutes. Frozen sections were removed from the straws and secured to
    the cryotome disc with O. C. T. medium. Sections were cut to a thickness 35 um
    using a cryotome (Leica CM1900, Leica, Bannockburn, IL, USA) (Figure 7). Cryotomed
    leaf 13 sections were carefully transported to microscope slides and stained using
    0.01% toluidine blue in phosphate buffer solution (PBS). Olympus compound light
    microscope (Olympus BX51) with 10x optical lens and digital camera (Olympus DP20)
    were used to take multiple images (average of 5 per section) of the leaf sections.

  replicates: 1
  methods: epidermal cell density of the lower side; Individual leaves were cut into
    1cm2 segments taken from the middle of each leaf, with one side of the leaf uncut
    to allow the segment to unfold. Leaf sections were placed in test tubes with 3mL
    of 30% hydrogen peroxide, 3mL of glacial acetic acid and 0.01g of triton-x. The
    tubes were placed in a 90 deg C water bath for 72. Sections were removed and rinsed
    with distilled water to remove mesophyll cell debris and traces of acid. The epidermal
    layers were floated in distilled water and any remaining tissues were removed
    using a soft, round-tip nylon paintbrush. Sections were stained overnight in 0.5%  aqueous
    safranin, rinsed with distilled water and mounted on glass microscope slides in
    40% glycerol. Sections were viewed through an Olympus compound light microscope
    (Olympus BX60) using 10x magnification. Images were collected using a JenOptik
    C14 digital camera with resolution 1300x1030 and image analysis software Image
    pro plus version 6.2 (Image-Pro Plus 6.2, Media Cybernetics, Inc., Maryland USA).
    An average of five images of the epidermal cells and stomates were acquired from
    varying depths/focuses. Wollemi pine leaves are decurrent and therefore have uneven
    epidermal layers. This requires multiple images at varying focal depths to be
    stacked into one focused image. The number of epidermal cells and number of stomates
    were counted using the image processing and analysis software, ImageJ (ImageJ
    1.41, Wayne Rasband, National Institute of Health, USA). Partial stomates and
    epidermal cells along the left hand side and top of the field of view were not
    counted; partial stomates along the right hand side and bottom of the field of
    view were included in the study. This eliminated bias from the stomatal counts.
    Stomatal index was calculated for the abaxial (underside) surface of the leaves,
    as adaxial side stomatal frequencies are significantly smaller and vary greatly,
    producing inconsistent stomatal counts, not representative of true stomatal frequencies.
    Stomatal index (proportion of epidermal cells that are stomata) was calculated
    by the equation S/[E+S] x 100. Where S = stomata per unit area and E = number
    of epidermal cells per unit area.
