  description: Wollemi pine (Wollemia nobilis W.G.Jones, K.D.Hill, & J.M.Allen), formerly
    widespread in Australia, was reduced to a remnant population of fewer than 100
    genetically indistinguishable individuals. Here, we examined the interactive effects
    of three [CO2] (290, 400 and 650 ppm) and two temperature (ambient, ambient +
    4 deg C) treatments on clonally-propagated Wollemi pine grown for 17 months in
    glasshouses under wellwatered and fertilised conditions.
  collection_type: experiment
  sample_age_class: seedling
  sampling_strategy: 'Plant material and growth conditions Wollemi pine (Wollemia
    nobilis W.G.Jones, K.D.Hill & J.M. Allen) plants were obtained as one-year-old,
    clonally propagated, potted plants from the Australian Botanic Garden (Mount Annan,
    NSW, Australia). Plants were planted one per pot in 2.4 L plastic pots filled
    with a potting mix consisting of 1.5 : 0.5 : 1 (v/v/v) coir peat, sand and Perlite,
    respectively, supplemented with lime, dolomite, iron sulfate, Micromax and Nutricote
    (N:13; Sungro Horticulture, Bellevue, WA, USA). The plants were randomly assigned
    to six adjacent, naturally sun-lit and temperature-controlled glasshouse compartments.
    Plants were grown under 50% shade cloth to provide optimal light intensities for
    ex situ Wollemi pine growth (Pohio et al. 2005). Pots were watered twice a week
    to through-flow with tap water. During the growing season (December-February),
    pots were watered ~every 6 weeks with Aquasol fertiliser (N: 23%, P: 4%, K:18%,
    Zn: 0.05%, Cu: 0.06%, Mo: 0.0013%, Fe: 0.06%, Bo: 0.01%; Yates Australia, Padstow,
    NSW, Australia) at a concentration of 2 g L-1. Plants were spot sprayed with Confidor
    pesticide (Bayer CropScience, Melbourne, Vic, Australia), at a concentration of
    1 g L-1, when pests (golden mealy bug (Nipaecoccus aurilanatus) and aphids (Aphis
    spp.)) were detected. The six glasshouse bays were separated into six factorial
    combinations of two temperature and three [CO2] regimes. Temperature and [CO2]
    were maintained as described in work by Ghannoum et al. (2010a). In brief, three
    bays tracked local (Richmond, NSW, Australia) ambient temperature (i.e. ambient
    temperature treatment) and three bays were maintained at ambient + 4 deg C (i.e.
    elevated temperature treatment). Air temperature was kept constant during the
    night and midday periods; temperature was stepped up and down in two 4 C steps
    before and after the midday period. Average temperatures for the ambient and elevated
    temperature treatments were 26/18 and 30/22 deg C (day/night) respectively. The
    temperature set point was maintained within +4 deg C and -2 deg C for 100% of
    the time. Within each temperature treatment, bays were automatically regulated
    to maintain pre-industrial (280 ppm), ambient (400 ppm) and elevated (640 ppm)
    [CO2]. Actual average daytime [CO2] during the study period for the pre-industrial,
    ambient and elevated treatments was 290, 400 and 650 ppm respectively. The CO2
    set point was maintained within +/- 20 ppm of the target 82-86% of the time across
    bays. Mixing bottled CO2 with ambient air (d13C ~ -9.83 per mille) resulted in
    a 13CO2 isotopic composition of d13C of about -5.51 per mille and -17.02 per mille
    under pre-industrial and elevated [CO2] respectively. Air d13C corresponded to
    average values determined (for the corresponding treatment) throughout the experiment,
    coinciding with gas exchange analyses. Average vapour pressure deficits in the
    bays over the growing season in the ambient temperature treatment were 1.49, 1.69
    and 1.62 kPa in the pre-industrial, ambient and elevated [CO2] treatments, respectively,
    and in the elevated temperature treatment were 1.17, 1.67 and 1.67 kPa in the
    pre-industrial, ambient and elevated [CO2] treatments respectively. Plants were
    rotated within glasshouse bays on a fortnightly basis and between glasshouse bays
    on a bi-monthly basis to minimise the impact of glasshouse bay environmental variation
    on plant responses to the [CO2] and temperature treatments.'

    pressure deficit (VPD) of 0.9-2.0 kPa, reflecting ambient VPD in the glasshouse

questions:
  contributor: In the spreadsheet with isotope data, both leaf and stem samples list
    pot 306. However, the leaf sample indicates this pot is at CO2 = 280 and the stem
    sample lists CO2 = 400. I've assumed a pot number refers to the same plant. Also
    pot 301 lists "Elev" temperature for the leaf sample and Ambient temperature for
    the stem sample. Based on your notes files, all pots in the 300's should be elevated
    temperature and CO2 = 280 ppm - can I correct the outliers?
  question2: In the manuscript you also mention CO2 response curves. If you'd like
    to submit these data as well, I can extract Amax (and corresponding stomatal conductance,
    ci, transpiration values) to also include in AusTraits.
  question3: Do you have additional methods information for the leaf anatomy data?
    In the notes file, I can see it was Allison Frith's honours project, but there
    are only definitions given, not methods.
  question4: Measurements in the Asat file were made at different PAR values (700
    vs 1000). I just want to confirm these are both considered "saturating" light
    levels. I've included the PAR reading at a contextual variable.
  additional_traits: percent mucilage cells, percent mesophyll cells, percent vascular
    cells, stomatal index of abaxial and adaxial sides; they also measured CO2 response
    curves.
