  description: An investigation of the effects of severe drought on the growth, water
    use and survival of five succulent species to determine how green roofs will perform
    in hot and dry climates where water is often limiting and drought tolerance determines
    plant survival.
  collection_type: glasshouse
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: Five succulent species were evaluated, three introduced Sedum
    species (S. pachyphyllum Rose, S. clavatum Clausen and S. spurium Marshall von
    Bieberstein) and two Australian species (Carpobro-tus modestus S.T. Blake and
    Disphyma crassifolium L.) (Table 1). The Sedum species are likely to be obligate
    CAM plants, however little is known about their CAM strategies. Butler (2012)
    found that although S. spurium showed nocturnal CO2 accumulation they did not
    show nocturnal CO2 uptake. The two Australian species are facultative CAM plants
    when water is limiting (Winter et al., 1981). Three month-old cuttings of each
    species were planted on December 1, 2010 into 200 mm diameter pots containing
    one of the three substrates (160 mm deep substrate). As cuttings had been grown
    in commercial potting mix, as much of this mix as possible was removed prior to
    planting to reduce the effects of this media on the water holding capacity of
    the green roof substrates. These were comprised of 80% readily available mineral
    components, either scoria, crushed roof tiles or bottom ash from coal fired power
    stations and 20% horticultural grade coir (Rayner et al., unpublished data). Table
    2 shows the aggregate sizes of the mineral components for the three green roof
    substrates. Scoria and crushed roof tile components were sourced locally from
    Melbourne, Victoria, while the bottom ash was sourced from coal-fired power stations
    in New South Wales. Whilst conforming to the FLL guidelines (2008), the three
    growing media differed in physical and chemical properties (Table 2), including
    water holding capacity (WHC). Bottom ash had a significantly higher WHC than either
    scoria or roof tile. Low WHC of the substrates was related to a higher air-filled
    porosity (AFP) in scoria but not in roof tile, which has a similar AFP to bottom
    ash.  ^p   As the three substrates differed in bulk densities, substrates were
    added by weight to pots to ensure the same volume (equivalent oven dried weight
    = 2702.8 g scoria; 3904.6 g roof tile; and 2051.2 g bottom ash substrate). This
    diameter pot approximates planting density on established green roofs in Melbourne
    (25 plants m-2). Fine mesh squares were placed in the bottom of pots to prevent
    loss of substrate. One month post-planting 12 g of slow release fertiliser (Osmocote
    plus, Scotts Australia Pty Ltd.; 16 nitrogen (N):1.3 phosphorus (P):9.1 potassium
    (K)) was added to the surface of each pot. ^p  2.1. Experimental design ^p    The
    drought experiment ran for 113 days (25 January to 17 June, 2011) and was conducted
    in a temperature controlled glasshouse at The University of Melbourne's Burnley
    campus, Melbourne, Australia (-37.828472, 145.020883). Daytime temperature ranged
    between 6 and 49 degC with a mean of 21.4 degC, and night-time temperatures ranged
    between 6 and 28 degC with a mean of 15.7 degC. We used a factorial randomised
    block design with substrate and watering regime (drought or well-watered) as treatments,
    with five replicates. All plants were watered weekly until the start of experiment
    (25 January 2011) when they were considered well established. Plants were considered
    well established when above ground growth was sufficient to cover the pot's surface.
    Two treatments were implemented, well-watered (WW) and droughted (D). Well-watered
    plants were watered once a week to pot capacity from days 1 to 85, then fortnightly
    until day 113 as evaporative demand declined. Droughted plants were watered to
    pot capacity at the start of the experiment then received no further watering.

questions:
  contributor: I could also include root:shoot ratios and could include the different
    drought treatments/growing conditions as contextual variables if you have a bigger
    dataset to contribute.
  question2: You'll notice that your "succulence" (leaf_water_content_per_area) values
    are far higher than other studies in AusTraits. I'm assuming this is accurate,
    since they are succulents. (And I've double checked the values in the manuscript
    and they are the same.)
