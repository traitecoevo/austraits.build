  description: The primary aim of this study was to determine whether selective pressures
    on species originating in drought-prone environments constrain hydraulic traits
    among related species grown under common conditions.
  basis_of_record: captive_cultivated
  life_stage: sapling
  sampling_strategy: The study was conducted in a plantation of Eucalyptus species
    at Richmond, New South Wales, Australia (33.33ºS, 150.44ºE) near the Hawkesbury
    River on alluvial floodplain at an elevation of 25 m. The local climate is sub-humid
    temperate, characterized by hot summers and the low possibility of frost during
    winter (approx. 13 times annually). Mean annual temperature is 17ºC, with a mean
    monthly maximum and minimum temperature of 30.1ºC and 3.5ºC generally achieved
    in January and July, respectively. Annual rainfall is 801mm, with a mean maximum
    and minimum rainfall of 129mm and 32mm per month, respectively, distributed fairly
    evenly but with the majority of rain falling in summer months. The plantations
    were established in September 2007 in a paddock with occasional weed control,
    as described previously in Héroult et al. (2013) and Bourne et al. (2015). The
    plantation consisted of two replicate, monoculture plots of each of five Eucalyptus
    species, namely Eucalyptus cladocalyx, E. crebra, E. dunnii, E. grandis and E.
    tereticornis, where each plot contained 35 individual trees planted at a density
    of 1000 trees ha-1 with a spacing of 2.6 m along the row and 3.85 m between rows.
    An additional monoculture plot of 160 trees of E. saligna was planted alongside
    these plantations with the same spacing at the same time. Seedlings were fertilized
    at planting in September 2007, watered by hand for the first 4 months of establishment,
    and replaced as required within the first year, with survival of all individuals
    at the time of measurement. Measurements were conducted on 4- to 5-year-old trees
    of each species with average tree heights of 8.8, 8.3, 13.1, 15.5, 11.1 and 12.8
    m for E. cladocalyx, E. crebra, E. dunnii, E. grandis, E. saligna and E. tereticornis,
    respectively. The driest part of each species range, being the lowest mean annual
    precipitation observed in the species range, was used as an indication of their
    ability to tolerate dry conditions, and in accordance with the Koppen-Geiger climate
    classification system we classified E. cladocalyx and E. crebra as sub-humid climate
    zone species, E. tereticornis as a sub-humid/humid intermediate species, and E.
    dunnii, E. grandis and E. saligna as humid zone species. We used climate maps
    in Peel et al. (2007) overlain with species distributions from the Atlas of Living
    Australia (ALA; www.ala.org. au) for these classifications, consistent with Bourne
    et al. (2015).

  methods: Estimates of vessel diameter and density were obtained for E. cladocalyx,
    E. crebra, E. dunnii, E. grandis, E. saligna and E. tereticornis trees. Sections
    of 20 lm thickness were taken from one separate branch segment from the upper
    third of the tree crown from each of five different trees using a sliding microtome.
    Photographs of these sections, stained with 0.05 % (w/v) Toluidine blue, were
    taken using a digital camera (ProgRes(R) C14, JenOptik, Hallam, Australia) with
    the Lumix Progress C4 software as seen at x40 (vessel counts) and x100 (vessel
    diameter) magnification under a microscope (Olympus BX60, Center Valley, PA, USA).
    We analysed these images and measured vessel diameter of all vessels >300 lm2
    throughout the sapwood of each section using ImageJ processing and analysis software
    (Abramoff et al., 2004). Hydraulically weighted vessel diameter (Dh), consistent
    with that measured by Sperry and Saliendra (1994), was calculated for interspecific
    comparisons of vessel anatomy and correlations with climate.

  entity_type: population
  value_type: mean

  replicates: 7
  methods: Stem hydraulics, Five to six branches from separate trees of E. cladocalyx,
    E. crebra, E. dunnii, E. grandis, E. saligna and E. tereticornis, with up to six
    4-9 cm long sub-samples per branch, were harvested from the upper third of the
    tree crown using a boom lift (Snorkel MHP13/35 Trailer Mounted Lift, Snorkel Ltd,
    Meadowbrook, Qld, Australia) and measured for stem hydraulic characteristics.
    Xylem vulnerability curves were constructed using the bench dehydration method
    (Sperry et al., 1988) where branches were progressively dried down at 25ºC for
    between one and 12 cumulative hours dependent on species selected, branch size
    and the desired water potential. Regardless of segment lengths considered, bench
    dehydration provides more accurate vulnerability estimates for long-vesseled species,
    prone to the 'open vessel' artefact, than either air injection or centrifuge methods
    (Choat et al., 2010, 2016; Cochard et al., 2013). As Eucalyptus species have long
    vessels (>1 m length), bench dehydration was used here. Xylem tension was relaxed
    prior to measurements in order to avoid possible excision artefacts (Wheeler et
    al., 2013; Torres- Ruiz et al., 2015). Preliminary testing of xylem tension relaxation
    in these species revealed that rehydration for up to 2 h followed by progressive
    cutting back underwater from upstream and downstream ends achieved the best results.
    Accordingly, stems were harvested close to dawn and rehydrated for 2 h in a walk-in
    cold room set to 4ºC. The first cut was made to the upstream end of the branch
    underwater, at least 30 cm from the desired segment, and left to rehydrate for
    10 min. Successive cuts were made at 2min intervals, allowing rehydration between
    each cut, alternating between upstream and downstream ends of the segment. Water
    potentials on excised leaves were measured prior to cutting the branch using a
    Scholander type pressure chamber (Model 1505D Pressure Chamber Instrument, PMS
    Instrument Company, Albany, OR, USA). Initial hydraulic conductivity (Kinitial)
    and final hydraulic conductivity (Kfinal) were measured using a 0.003MPa pressure
    head and logged using a digital liquid flow meter (Liqui-Flow L10, Bronkhorst
    High-Tech BV, Ruurlo, Gelderland, The Netherlands) and flow analysis programs
    FlowDDE (V. 4.69) and FlowPlot (Versions 4.69 and 3.34, respectively, Bronkhorst
    FlowWare, http://down loads.bronhorst.com). Kfinal was measured after flushing
    the stem segment with 2mmol KCl solution at a pressure of 175 kPa for 20min or
    until bubbles were no longer emitted from the segment.

    Accordingly, stems were harvested close to dawn and rehydrated for 2 h in a walk-in
    cold room set to 4ºC. The first cut was made to the upstream end of the branch
    underwater, at least 30 cm from the desired segment, and left to rehydrate for
    10 min. Successive cuts were made at 2min intervals, allowing rehydration between
    each cut, alternating between upstream and downstream ends of the segment. Water
    potentials on excised leaves were measured prior to cutting the branch using a
    Scholander type pressure chamber (Model 1505D Pressure Chamber Instrument, PMS
    Instrument Company, Albany, OR, USA). Initial hydraulic conductivity (Kinitial)
    and final hydraulic conductivity (Kfinal) were measured using a 0.003MPa pressure
    head and logged using a digital liquid flow meter (Liqui-Flow L10, Bronkhorst
    High-Tech BV, Ruurlo, Gelderland, The Netherlands) and flow analysis programs
    FlowDDE (V. 4.69) and FlowPlot (Versions 4.69 and 3.34, respectively, Bronkhorst
    FlowWare, http://down loads.bronhorst.com). Kfinal was measured after flushing
    the stem segment with 2mmol KCl solution at a pressure of 175 kPa for 20min or
    until bubbles were no longer emitted from the segment.
