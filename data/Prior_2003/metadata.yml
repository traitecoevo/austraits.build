  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: At each site, all tree species with six or more representatives
    at least 2 m tall and with accessible leaves (lower than about 2 m from the ground)
    were included in the study, giving a total of 21 species from the four habitats
    described above. Three species ( Melaleuca viridiflora, Terminalia ferdinandiana
    and Planchonia careya ) were found in two habitats (Table 1). A full set of measurements
    was made at both habitats for these species. Nomenclature follows that of the
    Northern Territory Herbarium (2003). The study species included evergreen, semi-deciduous
    and deciduous trees from 12 families (Table 1). Eight species are Myrtaceous and
    thus of Gondwanan origin, as is the coniferous family Cupressaceae; all other
    families are considered either Pan-tropic or Cosmopolitan (Thiele & Adams 1999).
    Phenological classification was based on observation during this study, as there
    are slight inconsistencies between Brock (1993) and Williams et al . (1997). Trees
    were considered evergreen if they maintained at least 60% canopy throughout the
    year. Deciduous species were defined as those in which every individual lost all
    its leaves for a period of at least 1 month (Williams et al . 1997). Other species
    were considered semi-deciduous. Two species ( Acacia auriculiformis and Erythrophleum
    chlorostachys ) are considered nitrogen-fixers.

  dry monsoon forest:
    longitude (deg): 130.9
    latitude (deg): -12.4
    description: The study sites were located near Darwin, northern Australia, in
      four distinct habitats common in the northern part of the Northern Territory.
      The dry monsoon forest site was at Leanyer (12.4degS, 130.9degE) while the other
      sites were located at Berry Springs Wildlife Park and the adjacent Berry Springs
      Nature Park (12.7deg S, 131.0deg E). Temperatures in this region are high all
      year round, with monthly means for Darwin ranging from 24.9degC in July to 29.2degC
      in November. Rainfall is extremely seasonal. 97% of Darwin's average annual
      1710 mm rain falls between October and April; June, July and August are virtually
      rainless (Commonwealth Bureau of Meteorology, Australia 2001). The dry monsoon
      forest at Leanyer has been largely actively regenerated since 1990, following
      cyclone damage, weed invasion and wildfire (Panton 1993). Remnant trees were
      used as the seed source for regeneration, so that all study species occur naturally
      in the area. Study trees were between 2 and 6 m tall and included remnant individuals
      from the original forest and planted trees that were 4-5 years old. The vegetation,
      soils and landforms of the Berry Springs locations have been described by Sivertsen,
      McLeod & Henderson (1980) and by Bowman & Minchin (1987). Each study site was
      about 0.5-1 ha in area. The open forest was on deep (>1 m) red massive earth,
      developed on highly weathered parent material. The woodland was located on shallow
      earthy sand with extensive surface gravel and low in nutrients (Sivertsen et
      al . 1980). The Melaleuca swamp was in a seasonally inundated section of a poorly
      drained depression. Neither open forest nor woodland had been burnt for at least
      10 years, in contrast to similar areas outside the Territory Wildlife Park,
      where fire is frequent (Russell-Smith, Ryan & Durieu 1997). March 2002, four
      to six samples of soil were taken from 0.2 m depth from each habitat for qualitative
      texture determination (by feel; Brady & Weil 1999) and nutrient analysis. Approximately
      600-800 g soil was dried at 60degC, ground, and passed through a 2 mm sieve
      to determine percentage gravel. Soil was then passed through a 1 mm sieve, and
      total Kjeldahl N and P were determined using flow-injection analysis (Lachat
      Instruments, Milwaukee, WI, USA).
