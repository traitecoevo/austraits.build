Species,Acacia carneorum,"Straggly spreading gregarious shrub or tree to 5 m high; habit similar to some Hakea spp. (e.g. H. leucoptera). Branchlet apices densely tomentulose-puberulous. Phyllodes sessile, patent to inclined, quadrangular in section with a yellow or light brown vein at apex of each angle, (2-) 3-9 cm long, 1-2 (-2.5) mm wide, pungent, thick, rigid; indumentum appressed-puberulous, becoming sparse or absent with age. Inflorescences simple, normally 1 per axil; peduncles 8-30 mm long, appressed-puberulous; heads globular, 35-60-flowered, bright golden. Flowers 5-merous; sepals united. Pods rarely produced, narrowly oblong, 2-5 cm long, 8-12 mm wide, thickly coriaceous to woody, dehiscing from apex. Seeds longitudinal, elliptic, c. 6 mm long, aril large and yellowish. Biochemically related to AcaciaÂ crombiei and A. peuce.Â See A. crombiei for note. Perhaps distantly related to A. atrox. Grows on sand ridges or sandy flats in mulga communities or with Callitris glaucophylla, or in alluvium along watercourses in chenopod low shrubland.

Species,Acacia catenulata subsp. occidentalis,"Tree to 8 (-10) m tall; trunk not fluted. New shoots not resinous, densely sericeous by silvery white or pale yellow hairs. Peduncles 2-7 mm long; spikes 8-15 mm long. Pods 4-6 (-8) mm wide. Perhaps conspecific with the typical subspecies which occurs in Queensland and Northern Territory, but subsp. catenulata seemingly grows to a taller plant and has deeply fluted trunks, according to L. Pedley, Austrobaileya 1: 145 (1978), and sometimes has resinous new shoots that are never yellow-hairy. This subspecies may resemble AcaciaÂ subcontorta with which it is sometimes sympatric. A putative hybrid between A. aneura and A. catenulata subsp. occidentalis occurs between Newman and Jiggalong, Western Australia. Grows on hardpan flats or gently undulating terrain along diffuse watercourses or colluvial fans, sometimes extending to dry low rocky hills or ridges. Grows in (sometimes stony) shallow, red-brown sandy loam, clay-loam, deep red loamy duplex soils or self-mulching cracking clays in open to moderately closed low woodlands of Eucalyptus victrix and/or with Mulga ('AcaciaÂ aneura group' of species). It often forms dense populations. Generally killed under hot fire conditions. However, lightly scorched plants or those burnt under cool fire conditions resprout from the crown, along main stems and branches or from the trunk just below ground level. Few fertile specimens are available to accurately determine the phenology. It appears to flower in response to rainfall between December and June, but not all plants in given populations produce flowers during this period.","grows on hardpan flats or gently undulating terrain along diffuse watercourses or colluvial fans, sometimes extending to dry low rocky hills or ridges. it appears to flower in response to rainfall between december and june, but not all plants in given populations produce flowers during this period.",ABRS_2022,,rain_autumn rain_winter,

Seeds Â±longitudinal, oblong-elliptic, 2-4.5 mm long, brown or black, often mottled; areole open, often yellowish. The two Tindale specimens from the type area (Murchison River) are characterised by phyllodes 3-8 mm wide, pods c. 2 mm wide, and inflorescences Â± round to broadly ellipsoidal. B.R. Maslin, Journal of the Adelaide Botanic Gardens 2(4): 318-319 (1980), stated that there are other recognisable forms. From Central Australian desert areas there is a form with narrower phyllodes (2-4 mm wide), broader pods (3-6 mm wide) and spicate inflorescences (e.g. H. Martin UNSW3560G and Maslin 5678). He also recorded a variant from the Pilbara region, Western Australia, with smaller, fimbriate, veinless calyces and interrupted spikes (e.g. Beard 6178); this variant is related to A. cyperophylla. Another variant is discussed by B.R. Maslin, Nuytsia 4: 98 (1982), from the Hamersley Ra., Western Australia, with narrowly elliptic (instead of linear) phyllodes 4.5-6.5 cm long and 5-8 mm wide. Further material and field investigations of this variable species are necessary. Grows in drier areas, in red sandy soils or on rocky ground, often on laterite, quartzite or granite, in gullies along creeks, on plains, sand hills, mesas or scree slopes, in scrub heath, Casuarina scrub or frequently associated with spinifex.

Related to Acacia sp. F and A. translucens in the 'A. stigmatophylla group', but is distinguished by its prominently spreading, large flower-buds, often larger flowers with striated petals, and a Â±erect knob-like to conical mucro on the phyllodes (the apical mucro is initially flattened against the lamina margin in the other species). A small flowered variant occurs in the Sturt Creek area, W.A., to The Granites-Rabbit Flat area, N.T., and is characterised by smaller, more compact heads (5-7 mm diam.) often containing a larger number of flowers (up to 37 per head) which are usually smaller with a corolla 1.5-1.9 (-2.5) mm long, e.g. Wolf Creek Crater, A.S.George 15333 (DNA, PERTH), 21 miles [33.8 km] NW of Granites, N.T., J.R.Maconochie 999 (BRI, DNA, K, MEL, NSW, PERTH).

Genus,Arthrochilus,"Deciduous, terrestrial orchids growing in clonal colonies, with dimorphic flowering and non-flowering plants. Non-flowering plants consist solely of a leafy rosette; flowering plants consist of a thin, wiry, leafless stem and an inflorescence, but usually no rosette until later (Arthrochilus longicollis and A. rosulatusÂ are unusual in having a stem-encircling basal rosette). Rosette terminating stem or on basal lateral growth on peduncle. Leaves 2-6 spreading from central point in rosette, mostly ground-hugging, petiolate or sessile. Raceme multiflowered; peduncle thin, wiry, with many sterile bracts. Flowers non-resupinate, dull-coloured, insectiform. Tepals inconspicuous, mostly recurved or reflexed against ovary. Dorsal sepal larger than lateral sepals, recurved. Lateral sepals basally attached to column foot. Petals narrower than sepals. Labellum hinged by short claw to underside of column foot, projecting out like an insectiform lure. Labellum lamina unlobed, simple and vestigial. Callus large, hammer-shaped, dominating labellum, main body covered with colourful hairs and/or shiny, club-shaped calli or warty calli, limb extending from main body ending in an irregularly swollen head-like structure (apex). Column slender, curved in semi-circle, with 2 unequal pairs of long, slender, curved wings (one pair above anther); front hairy, often spotted. Pollinia four, deeply bilobed, mealy, yellow, no viscidium. Species of Arthrochilus are common in the wetter tropical regions of N Australia, and many new species await discovery and formal recognition. Arthrochilus is not an easy genus to research and linking floral and vegetative parts of each species can be difficult because the flower stems appear very early in the wet season when field work is difficult and the rosettes commonly appear well after the flowers. In some seasons flowering may be finished when the main part of the wet season is underway. Most of the significant features for identification occur in the flowers but the rosettes can also be distinctive. The rosettes are also easier to locate and can be cultivated to produce flowers in the following season. These orchids grow in a range of habitats including shrubby forest, heathland, monsoon forest, rocky escarpments and sedgeland in soils ranging from freely draining to low-lying flats and swampy areas that become soaked during the wet season. Flowering in the tropical species is closely associated with the wet season, the first inflorescences often following the early heavy rains of the build-up. The flower stems have often finished by the time the rosettes appear. Flowering however, can continue as long as suitable growing conditions occur and in prolonged wet seasons the inflorescences become very tall with buds, flowers, capsules and dehisced capsules all present at the same time. It is normal for only a low proportion of plants in a colony to produce inflorescences. Colonies of rosettes can be very prominent later in the season. Pollinated by male thynnine wasps that are attracted to the flowers by scents mimicking sexual pheromones, and attempt to fly away with the labellum for mating purposes. This activity is vigorous and it is not uncommon for the labellum to be torn off the flower during this process. Preliminary research shows a specific 1: 1 relationship between the orchid and the pollinator. The capsule matures its seed in an erect position.","these orchids grow in a range of habitats including shrubby forest, heathland, monsoon forest, rocky escarpments and sedgeland in soils ranging from freely draining to low-lying flats and swampy areas that become soaked during the wet season. flowering in the tropical species is closely associated with the wet season, the first inflorescences often following the early heavy rains of the build-up.",Flora_of_Australia,,,

The S.A. collection cited is the only one known and the locality may have been a base for collecting trips rather than an actual collecting locality (J.Jessop, pers. comm.).

Genus,Caladenia,"Most above-ground parts of these terrestrial orchids are hairy. The plants have a single basal leaf that is usually much longer than wide and subtends a stiff flower stem that usually carries a single flower, but some species can have up to 6 flowers. Flower size ranges from small with 2 lateral sepals and petals projecting forwards like fingers, to large spidery flowers with spreading tepals ending in tailed, wispy or clubbed segments. A few species are distinctive for their bizarre-shaped flowers. The sepals and petals of each species are mostly very similar in size and shape. In many species the extended tips of the tepals are covered with scent-producing glands; sometimes the tips are replaced by thickened, club-like structures (osmophores) containing the glands. These glandular tails and clubs are the site of pseudopheromone production that is important for pollination. The labellum of each Caladenia species is markedly different to all the other floral segments in shape and is often also of a contrasting colour, especially the apical lobe which in many species is bright red to maroon. The labellum is hinged by a short claw to the base of the column, usually stiffly hinged but sometimes delicately balanced. Labellum shape ranges from unlobed to distinctly 3-lobed, with the lateral lobes often broad and curved upwards to flank the column; and usually arches longitudinally in a graceful curve, often with the apex recurved or coiled inwards. Labellum margins range from entire to adorned with a fringe of variously shaped marginal teeth, these sometimes fused into a thickened band. The centre of the labellum is adorned with rows of stalked or sessile, colourful calli in various shapes, decreasing in size towards the labellum apex. In some groups of Caladenia, the basal calli are a different size and colour to the rest. The column is narrowly to broadly winged and the anther carries four bilobed, flat pollinia without a viscidium. The pollen is usually yellow, occasionally white. Most Caladenia species occur as separate individuals, some form clonal colonies, and some grow in localised clonal tufts. The root system consists of a parent tuber and replacement tuber partially covered by a fibrous multilayered tunic which extends as a sheath to the soil surface and through which each annual shoot develops. Tubers are replaced annually on short droppers, the new one often deeper in the soil than the previous one. Each tuber adds a new layer of fibre to the inner side of the tunic. The sheath of old plants consists of several layers of fibre and is expanded at each point where a tuber has developed, these structures often forming an interlinked chain. At ground level the stem swells and forms a collar, which is the primary site of fungal infection.  Species of Caladenia occur in a wide range of forested, shrubby and heathy habitats from the coast to the inland plains, and from the lowlands to montane and subalpine areas. They mostly grow in soils with free drainage, but some species have adapted to seasonally moist, wet or peaty soils. Flowering is generally enhanced by hot summer fires, especially when densely overgrown vegetation is burnt. Species of Caladenia are deciduous and die back to a dormant, fleshy tuber over summer. The tuber sprouts after soaking autumn/winter rains and develops a leaf which expands and matures before an inflorescence is produced. Caladenia species use a range of strategies to achieve cross-pollination. Most species are sexually deceptive; fooling their insect pollinators into thinking they are a desirable insect mate. Several Caladenia species use food deception to attract other types of insects by pretending to offer a food reward. A small number of Caladenia species are self-pollinating. To achieve pollination by sexual deception, the orchid lures male thynnine wasps to the flower by producing a false sex hormone (kairomone or pseudopheromone) that mimics the sex scent released by a wingless female thynnine wasp when advertising for a mate. At close range, the shape, colour and tactile features of the flower persuade the male wasp to grapple with the labellum, either attempting to mate with it or fly away with the labellum for aerial mating. Passive pivoting movements of the labellum during the grappling process bring the wasp into proximity with the pollen, depositing the pollinia on the wasp's thorax, or on the stigma when the wasp visits a second flower. Recent research has shown that some wasp-pollinated spider orchids (e.g. C. arenaria, C. hastata, C. paludosa) produce small amounts of nectar on the labellum which probably acts both as a reward and an inducement for the wasp to continue visiting other flowers. Detailed studies indicate that most sexually deceptive species of Caladenia have a relationship with a single species of wasp (Phillips et al. 2009b). However, pollinator sharing can occur between species of wasp-pollinated Caladenia, indicating geographical variation in the composition of the wasp pheromone produced by the orchid (Colin Bower, pers. comm.). Cryptic species have been shown to occur within Caladenia concinna (Bower 2001a) and C. tentaculata (Phillips et al. 2009b). Most species of Caladenia that have colourful flowers use food deception to achieve pollination. Very few species produce visible quantities of nectar on the labellum (C. nana is an exception). This system of deceit is common in the small-flowered species but also found in several of the larger-flowered spider orchids and wispy spider orchids. Although very few studies have been undertaken, the pollinators are mostly small native bees of the families Apidae (social bees), Colletidae (plasterer bees) and Halictidae (sweat bees); also flies in the families Syrphidae (hover flies) and Conopidae (thick-headed flies). Nectar scarab beetles (Cetoniinae) pollinate C. flava. Introduced honey bees (Apis mellifera) have been observed visiting flowers and removing pollinia. No apparent close or specific relationship between the pollinator and the orchid species has been noted. Self-pollination is relatively rare in Caladenia, which is perhaps surprising considering that several species extend into montane areas with climates that are not particularly congenial to insects. Altogether, about 12 species of small-flowered Caladenia are known to be self-pollinating, as well as C. graminifolia and C. cruscula, and two subspecies of the Limestone Spider Orchid (C. bicalliata subsp. bicalliata and subsp. cleistogama). Most species flower in late winter, spring and early summer. Caladenia drummondii is an exception, flowering in winter while the leaf is still not fully expanded.","they mostly grow in soils with free drainage, but some species have adapted to seasonally moist, wet or peaty soils. the tuber sprouts after soaking autumn/winter rains and develops a leaf which expands and matures before an inflorescence is produced.",Flora_of_Australia,,,

This species, together with Cryptostylis subulata, Diplodium alatum and Eriochilus cucullatus, was among the earliest Australian orchids to be scientifically described. It was first collected in 1793 by a group of French botanists and biologists, headed by Jacques-Julien Houtou de LabillardiÃƒÆ’Â¨re who named the species in 1806 as Epipactis reflexa. These scientists, who were on a French expedition which visited south-eastern Tas. while searching for the lost expedition of La PÃƒÆ’Â©rouse, collected around Recherche Bay for five weeks between January and May 1793. The botanical results of the collections, including illustrations, were published in two volumes entitled Nova Hollandiae Plantarum Specimen in 1804-1806. Epipactis reflexa was illustrated on tab. 211 in the second volume. The type specimens and/or original illustrations of LabillardiÃƒÆ’Â¨re's Australian orchids are housed in the Herbarium at the University of Florence in Italy.

Genus,Corunastylis,"Plants growing singly or in loose groups. Root system consists of paired tubers (a parent tuber and a replacement tuber) and a few short roots, including 1 or 2 specialised mycorrhizal roots which tend to grow upwards (apogeotrophic). Leaf single, thin, wiry, solid. In flowering plants the leaf and peduncle of the inflorescence are inseparably fused and emerge from the soil as a single unit with an immature inflorescence at the apex, the leaf with a short, free apical part (free part) which may embrace the peduncle or spread away from the flower stem. Inflorescence racemose or spicate, few- to multi-flowered. Floral buds enlarge as the fused leaf/peduncle elongates, opening when mature. Flowers non-resupinate, sessile to subsessile, dull-coloured or dark, often with a fruity fragrance. Tepals glabrous, hairy or glandular-hairy. Dorsal sepal free, broader than lateral sepals, hooding column, sometimes with an apical gland. Lateral sepals free, narrower and longer than dorsal sepal, often basally gibbous, sometimes with an apical gland (often dropping off or reduced to vestigial remnants). Petals free, smaller than sepals, often longitudinally striped. Labellum hinged by small, flexible claw to apex of column foot, sometimes hinged delicately and labellum tremulous, vibrating in the slightest breeze. Labellum lamina unlobed, thin or fleshy, margins entire, serrulate, glandular or hairy. Callus a thin to fleshy, nectar-bearing plate, sometimes dominating the labellum, centrally grooved, surface smooth, papillate or colluviate. Column small with lobed wings and a well-developed basal foot. Pollinia 4, in two unequal pairs, clavate, sectile, yellow, attached via hamulus to viscidium.  These orchids grow in freely draining to moisture-retentive soils in open forest, woodland, coastal scrub, heathland, rock outcrops and swamps. A preferred habitat is moss pads in shallow soil over rock plates. Corunastylis plants are generally inconspicuous and can be difficult to see among grasses, rushes and sedges. Non-flowering plants consist of a thin, wispy leaf that is almost invisible except in open rocky sites. Flowering plants are wiry with a thin, solitary leaf and a spike of small, crowded, upside-down flowers. Most species flower in summer and autumn. Flowering is probably triggered by rainfall, but flowering plants can also appear prior to the appearance of substantial rain. Species of Corunastylis also respond positively to rain falling after they flower, the extra moisture resulting in the development of large replacement tubers which flower the next season irrespective of the arrival of the summer/autumn rains. This is especially true of species growing in areas of low or unreliable rainfall and explains the appearance of flowering plants even in dry seasons. Flowering is often promoted by burning; certainly the plants are much easier to see in the first two or three years after a fire. Slashing sometimes has a similar effect. In some species of Corunastylis the fused leaf/flower stalk lengthens considerably (30-70 cm) after flowering to facilitate seed dispersal. The plants are then much more visible. At least five species of Corunastylis are either self-pollinating or apomictic, but most are pollinated by insects that are attracted to the flowers by a combination of dark floral colours, fruity or sour perfumes (not always detectable by humans), tremulous labella, hairy segments, and the presence of nectar. According to Bower (2001) and Bower et al. (2015), pollination in the few species so far studied is exclusively by small flies of the families Chloropidae (grass flies), Milichiidae (jackal flies) and Scatopsidae (scavenger flies). The flies land on the inflorescence and then move to the labellum and feed on the labellum nectar, delving deep into the flower until they reach the base of the labellum, eventually contacting the viscidium and removing the pollinarium on their thorax. Pollen deposition occurs during a subsequent visit. Garnet (1940) collected five species of flies on unspecified species of Corunastylis; two of the flies were chloropids (Caviceps flavipes and Gaurax (as Oscinosoma subpilosa). The author has collected unidentified species of Clavipes on Corunastylis despectans, C. morrisii, C. nigricans and C. rufa. Alan Logan collected a species of Gaurax (Chlopopidae) and Stomosis (Milichiidae) on Corunastylis clivicola and Colin Bower collected Clavipes flavipes on Corunastylis rufa (both records in Bower 2001). Ants may also be occasional pollinators of these orchids. For photos of insects visiting the flowers of species of Corunastylis see Kuiter (2013, pp. 70-75; 2017, pp. 36-55)."," these orchids grow in freely draining to moisture-retentive soils in open forest, woodland, coastal scrub, heathland, rock outcrops and swamps. flowering is probably triggered by rainfall, but flowering plants can also appear prior to the appearance of substantial rain. species of corunastylis also respond positively to rain falling after they flower, the extra moisture resulting in the development of large replacement tubers which flower the next season irrespective of the arrival of the summer/autumn rains. this is especially true of species growing in areas of low or unreliable rainfall and explains the appearance of flowering plants even in dry seasons.",Flora_of_Australia,,,

Genus,Didymoplexis,"Leafless terrestrial orchids with a fleshy root system consisting of slender, interconnected, elongated rhizomes with roots arising from apex; and pale, fleshy, brittle flower stems. Inflorescence racemose, flowers opening sequentially. Pedicels fleshy. Flowers short-lived (less than a day), bell-shaped, shedding completely from the flower stem soon after flowering unless pollinated. Basal parts of sepals and petals fused to form a tube with the apical parts separate and spreading widely. Labellum hinged to apex of short column foot. Labellum lamina unlobed, with a central keel carrying irregular rows of calli. Column slender with very short column foot. Anther with 4 pollinia attached directly to viscidium.  Localised and disjunct; growing in seasonally wet areas in rainforest, grassy forest, and bamboo thickets, often in black peaty soil. The flowers are insect-pollinated, but the pollinators are unknown. Being leafless, species of Didymoplexis are obligate mycoheterotrophs that are completely dependant on mycorrhizal fungi in the family Marasmiaceae to obtain nutrients and organic carbon materials needed for the orchid's growth. Flower stems emerge above the ground and produce flowers after the first soaking rains of the wet season. Each flower lasts less than a day with the stem extending before the next flower expands. After pollination, the individual flower stems (pedicels) elongate considerably prior to seed dispersal and the upright capsules shed seed 7-12 days later.","growing in seasonally wet areas in rainforest, grassy forest, and bamboo thickets, often in black peaty soil. flower stems emerge above the ground and produce flowers after the first soaking rains of the wet season.",Flora_of_Australia,,,

Basal palea acute or obtuse. Specimens of E. acicularis are distinguished from the closely related E. ramosus by having generally more spikes, the foliage mostly at the base of the plant, and usually by the presence of an external ligule which may vary from a discontinuous pubescence across the collar region of only some of the leaves to an indurated membranous-ciliolate protuberance present on all leaves. A few collections appear to lack an external ligule, but at least some of the leaf blades, sheaths and/or orifices are hairy, whereas E. ramosus is always completely glabrous (except for occasional hairs behind the internal ligule). Differences are further discussed under E. ramosus. Intermediates between these two species occur in N.S.W.

Inflorescences usually digitate or subdigitate, or rarely with branches whorled; branches 2-6 (-10), 5-15 cm long, rigid. Glumes: lower glume 2-3.5 mm long, muticous or aristulate; upper glume 3.5-7.3 mm long, with awn usually less than 1 mm long. Callus 0.6-1.3 mm long. Basal lemma narrowly lanceolate, 5.5-7.4 (-9) mm long, acuminate, entire or bidentate, cartilaginous, scaberulous or scabrous; awn much longer than lemma body, 9-14 mm long. Basal palea acute or obtuse. This is Enteropogon acicularis (Lindl.) Lazarides form A, Austral. J. Bot., Suppl. Ser. 5: 33 (1972). Dried specimens of E. ramosus are most reliably distinguished from those of E. acicularis by the combination of completely glabrous foliage (except for occasional hairs behind the ligule) and the absence of an external ligule. In addition, E. ramosus tends to be taller, with fewer spikes, and the culms branching at several nodes is distinctive in more mature specimens. The two species may be more readily distinguished in the field, as the spikes of E. ramosus are reported to spread in a single plane while those of E. acicularis are arranged in several planes. The leaves of E. ramosus are borne along the whole culm length, but are mostly basal in E. acicularis, though this may be partly related to the height. Abruptly twisting mature leaves have been seen on specimens of E. acicularis but this condition is more common in E. ramosus. Intermediates between these two species sometimes occur in N.S.W.Â  Usually on light-textured soils such as sandy loams, but also known fromheavy-textured red earths and skeletal soils; often in seasonally wet areassuch as creek beds, with Eucalyptuscamaldulensis or Melaleuca, or in woodlands withPoplar Box (Eucalyptus populnea), Wilga (Geijera parviflora), Gidgee (Acacia cambagei) or Mulga (Acacia aneura), or in mallee or shrublands with Atriplex, Maireana, Acacia and Triodia; often common but never dominant in the understorey.Â  Flowers in summer or in response to rain in N.S.W., throughout the year butespecially in early summer in S.A., flowering recorded for Apr.-May, July inthe Kimberley region of W.A."," flowers in summer or in response to rain in n.s.w., throughout the year butespecially in early summer in s.a., flowering recorded for apr.-may, july inthe kimberley region of w.a.",ABRS_2022,,rain,

Flower stems appear rapidly after the first heavy, soaking rains of summer and disappear just as quickly, the period from flowering to seed dispersal being only a few days. Successive flowering stems can appear if rainfall persists. This orchid often appears in small groups and can disappear from an area for many years. The flowers have an unusual smell resembling clag. See Jones (1985) for a detailed study of the method of self pollination.

This culturally significant plant, colloquially referred to as the desert fig, grows on elevated landscapes in central Australia, including Uluru (Ayers Rock), Kata Tjuta (The Olgas) and Karlu Karlu (Devils Marbles), three of Central Australia's best-known natural landmarks. Usually on rocky sandstone, quartzite, or siliceous slopes, ridges and cliff faces, or on large granite or sandstone boulder fields, often associated with drainage lines, water-accumulation points and waterholes, the roots commonly following rock fissures. For associated plant species see Wilde & Barrett (2021: 297). The fruit is eaten by the Western Bowerbird, Ptilonorhynchus guttatus guttatus (Gould) (see Fig. 10 in Wilde & Barrett 2021: 298). The distribution of this bowerbird subspecies is very similar to that of the desert figs in Central Australia and it has a strong (though not exclusive) ecological link to the fig trees, as fruit are available all year round, the fig trees often grow near water, and the dense cover offers excellent sites for bower construction. The Western Bowerbird might be the vector of desert figs growing on inaccessible cliffs and located many kilometres away from their nearest neighbours through consumption of fruit. Flowering and fruiting all year round following rainfall, but the main fruiting time appears to be August-January. Desert figs are an important traditional food source for many Aboriginal people in Central Australia, being rich in both calcium and potassium. Dry figs that are ground with water can be formed into balls that can then be re-dried and stored for long periods for consumption when other foods are scarce. In addition to utilisation for food, the leaves of this species were used for children's games, women's leaf games, and love potions.

Genus,Hibbertia,"Erect to prostrate or rarely mat-forming shrubs (rarely climbers or small trees), glabrous or with a vestiture of simple or fascicled (2-many-armed) hairs which are sometimes scale-like and may be borne on tubercles. Stems Â± terete or rarely flattened into cladodes (in subgen. Pachynema). Leaves well-developed or rarely reduced to scales or apparently absent, alternate (sometimes appearing fascicled when borne on short-shoots) or very rarely opposite (not in Australia), simple, sessile (rarely perfoliate or amplexicaul) to shortly (rarely long-) petiolate, exstipulate, often with intrapetiolar tufts of hairs; lamina entire or rarely toothed or lobed, terete to flat, with margin flat to tightly recurved or revolute (the leaves then often sclerophyllous and ericoid), rarely involute; midrib prominent to apparently absent; apex retuse or obtuse to acute or pungent-pointed, straight or recurved. Flowers sessile or pedicellate, terminal but often appearing leaf-opposed due to overgrowth of the flower-subtending shoot or axillary when terminal to a short-shoot, single or in bracteate, unbranched (rarely branched) pseudo-cincinnae. Bracts 1-many, subtending the flower or borne on or at the base of the pedicel, herbaceous to scarious. Sepals 5, quincuncial, slightly connate at base, usually somewhat accrescent, the outer often differing in shape, size or vestiture from the inner. Petals 5 (rarely 1 or 2), free, quincuncial (when 5), actinomorphic or slightly zygomorphic, usually obovate and entire to distinctly emarginate, yellow (rarely white, orange, red or pink), caducous (rarely persistent). Stamens 1-numerous, in a complete to interrupted ring (rarely in 2 or 3 distinct whorls) or in 2-5 groups around the carpels or in a group to one side of the carpels (then erect or curving over the gynoecium); filaments filiform or occasionally strap-like (often stout in subgen. Pachynema), free to almost completely connate when the stamens are in groups; anthers dehiscing by latrorse to introrse slits which may be short and terminal (the anthers then Â± porate) or as long as the locules; staminodes absent or present. Carpels (1) 2-5 (-10); ovaries free, erect to spreading, glabrous to hairy or covered with scales, with terminal and usually excentric styles, 1-8-ovulate, the ovules tending to be basal when 1 or 2, marginal when many. Fruit a follicle, rarely on an elongated gynophore; seeds usually Â± globular, endospermic, with an entire to fimbriate aril that may be short and basal to completely enclosing the seed and is semi-translucent to opaque-white or (rarely) fleshy and brightly red or orange; embryo usually poorly differentiated when the seed is shed. Generic delimitation. Hibbertia is currently classified into four subgenera (Horn 2007, 2009): subgen. Adrastaea (DC.) J.W.Horn (1 sp.), subgen. Hemistemma (Juss. ex Thouars) J.W.Horn (c. 225 spp.), subgen. Hibbertia (c. 90 spp.) and subgen. Pachynema (R.Br. ex DC.) J.W.Horn (c. 12 spp.). The latter three have been further informally subdivided into species groups based on morphology by previous authors (e.g., Thiele 2019a, 2019b; Toelken 2010, 2013; Wheeler 2002, 2004). There is good preliminary molecular support for some species groups as monophyletic clades (see Horn 2009; Thiele 2019a). Vestiture. Hair morphology, length and density, particularly on stems, leaves, sepals and carpels, are highly varied in Hibbertia and are important for distinguishing between species groups and discriminating some closely related species. Hairs may be simple and unicellular or fascicled, i.e. comprising 2-many unicellular arms arising from a single point on the epidermis. When fascicled, the individual arms may be Â± equal in length or very unequal and may be spreading-erect, antrorsely-directed or flattened-radiate; in the latter case they are often variably fused to form peltate scales. Fascicled hairs with two equal arms are called twinned hairs. A distinctive type of hair found on some species is simple, short and distinctly uncinate (called hooked hairs in the descriptions); these are often slightly to distinctly retrorse. Both simple and few-armed fascicled hairs may be very short (the surface then being minutely scabrid) to long; in general, simple hairs form softer vestitures than fascicled hairs. Fascicled hairs are often borne on rounded or sometimes elongate epidermal tubercles; hooked hairsÂ may also be tuberculate at the base. Only simple hairs are present in subgen. Hibbertia, while fascicled hairs and hooked hairs are common in subgen. Hemistemma. For more information on hairs in the genus, see discussions in Horn (2007), Thiele (2015) and Toelken (1998, 2010, 2012, 2013). Leaves. Leaves vary from broadly orbicular to narrowly linear, with or without a prominent midrib below, and may be terete or have an expanded lamina; when laminate, the margin may be flat, recurved to revolute or (rarely) involute. Many species in subgen. Hemistemma have ericoid leaves, with the margin tightly recurved or revolute and often butting tightly against the midrib below. In such cases, the true abaxial leaf surface may be completely obscured in both fresh and dried specimens. Stomata in all species are borne only on the abaxial surface; it is likely that in the many species with ericoid leaves, the whole leaf essentially acts as a stomate, with minor movements of the lamina margin towards or away from the midrib controlling water relations. In many such species the nature of the (largely hidden) abaxial surface is important for species discrimination, being either glabrous, distinctly papillate, or densely hairy. Leaves on specimens may need to be broken to observe this feature. Mature plants within subgen. Pachynema appear leafless or have leaves reduced and scale-like; only seedlings (or vigorously resprouting growth) bear ""normal"" leaves. Inflorescence. Most species have solitary, terminal flowers, which may be sessile or pedicellate (the flower stalks sometimes referred to as ""peduncles""). Early growth of a subtending shoot from an axil of a subtending leaf or bract (see below) may render the flower leaf-opposed; the branch system when flowering is thus sympodial. Flowers may also be borne (and sometimes closely aggregated) on short-shoots, in which case they appear axillary. Several species groups in subgen. Hemistemma have flowers borne in unusual bracteate inflorescences (Thiele 2019b), here called pseudo-cincinnae (because their bract pattern indicates that they may not to be cymose like true cincinnae). In Australia such inflorescences are usually unbranched, but in a distinctive New Caledonian radiation they may be branched. Floral bracts. Flowers are usually subtended by one to several bracts that clearly comprise modified leaves but are morphologically distinct from normal leaves. The terminal (primary, flower-subtending) bract always lacks an axillary bud, while all distal bracts bear an axillary bud; growth of these buds (or axillary buds from upper leaves) continues the shoot axis sympodially. When pedicellate flowers are subtended by a single (primary) bract, the bract may be at the apex of the pedicel immediately below the calyx, at the base of the pedicel, or variably along the pedicel; the bract position in these cases is species-diagnostic. Secondary bracts in pedicellate flowers are always at the base of the pedicel. Bract texture varies between species, from herbaceous to distinctly scarious. Secondary bracts may morphologically grade into normal leaves. In some species one to several leaves subtending a flower differ in size and shape from stem leaves. Androecium. Androecia in Hibbertia are very diverse. Stamens may be arranged all around, only on one side of, or rarely on opposite sides of, the carpels. Species in subgen. Hibbertia always have an actinomorphic androecium (the stamens arranged all around the gynoecium). By contrast, most species in subgen. Hemistemma have a zygomorphic androecium, with the the stamens all on one side of the (usually two) carpels. The disposition of stamens (and styles) in both cases is highly diagnostic, presumably due to specialised pollination syndromes: in those members of subgen. Hemistemma with a zygomorphic androecium, the stamens and styles may be erect, or the stamens may curve forwards over the carpels and their short, curved styles. In the latter case the androecium is reminiscent of a hand of bananas. When stamens are distributed all around the carpels they may be free in a single or multi-layered whorl, or in clusters (often between the carpels). The filaments in the latter case may be free or variously fused. Staminodes (reduced, infertile stamens) are present in some species groups in subgen. Hemistemma and Pachynema (less often in subgen. Hibbertia). The presence or absence, and positions when present, of the staminodes with respect to the stamens is always species-diagnostic. Subgenus Pachynema and subgen. Adrastaea have 2 or 3 distinct whorls to the androecium, with the inner whorl of two stamens or staminodes that are alternate to the 2 carpels. The filaments of some species in subgen. Pachynema are rounded and transversely thickened. Most species are found in shrublands, woodlands and forests, with very few in alpine or desert regions. Most species are likely to be principally bee-pollinated. Some species may be pollinated by shield-bearing moths (Heliozelidae), which also lay their eggs in the carpels. Flower beetles are commonly seen on some species eating the anthers, pollen and carpels; it is not known whether these are effective pollinators. Seed dispersal is likely to be by birds for those (few) species with red- or orange-coloured fleshy arils that enclose the seed, and by ants for species that have a reduced, usually translucent, aril, which may act as an elaiosome (Stebbins & Hoogland 1976). The seeds of some species have a long and complex seed dormancy (Schatral et al. 1997, Hidayati et al. 2012), the seeds at dispersal having a scarcely differentiated embryo. Fire ecology varies from obligately resprouting to obligately reseeding after disturbance (usually fire). Obligate reseeders mostly germinate readily, while obligate resprouters may be intractable germinators (Hidayati et al. 2012). Temperate species flower mostly in spring and early summer, sometimes with occasional flowering in response to rain at other times of the year; species in the monsoon tropics flower in the late wet and early dry season.","temperate species flower mostly in spring and early summer, sometimes with occasional flowering in response to rain at other times of the year;",Flora_of_Australia,,,

Leptochloa fusca subsp. fusca and L. fusca subsp. muelleri have sometimes been treated as two species (Diplachne fusca and D. muelleri), and sometimes as subspecies of Diplachne fusca, in regional floras published during the 20th century. The two taxa are similar in vegetative dimensions, but in subsp. fusca the lemma is uniformly coloured, while in subsp. muelleri the lemmas have an olive-green or greyish spot occupying about the lower two-thirds and are paler towards the apex and lateral nerves when mature. The lengths of the spikelets, and the length and width of the fertile florets, tend to be greater in subsp. muelleri, and the florets are only dorsally compressed, whereas subsp. fusca has some lateral compression and keeling of the fertile floret. Leptochloa fusca subsp. muelleri has been widely collected from central Australia and central W.A., while subsp. fusca appears more confined to the eastern states and the north coast of the continent, the two subspecies overlapping in the arid to semi-arid regions of N.S.W. and Qld. Both L. fusca subsp. fusca and L. fusca subsp. muelleri are palatable to stock, atleast in western N.S.W., while other Leptochloa species occurring in thesame region are not (Cunningham et al., Pl. W. New South Wales, 1992). Being free-seedingand somewhat salt tolerant, they can assist in the reclamation of scaldedduplex soils.

Genus,Nervilia,"Terrestrial tuberous orchids. Flowering and non-flowering plants dimorphic, growing in vegetative colonies. Rootstock consists of stem tubers with nodes and short, spreading roots, reproducing by daughter stem tubers produced on the end of horizontal, multi-noded stolons. Sterile plants consist of a single, plicate, ground-hugging or erect leaf. Flowering plants have no leaf at flowering time, but consist of a fleshy flower stem with 1 to a few erect or nodding flowers, leaf arising at the base of the finished flower stem. Inflorescence racemose, 1- to few-flowered. Flowers resupinate or non-resupinate, short-lived (1-4 days). Sepals and petals free, narrow, similar in size and shape. Labellum attached to anterior base of column. Labellum lamina 3-lobed, without spur; lateral lobes column-embracing. Column slender, without basal foot.  Grassy or forested areas, along stream banks and rainforest margins. Flowering is closely connected with the wet season. Flowering plants are not commonly seen in the wild since they appear rapidly after the first heavy rains of the wet season and are short-lived, usually only lasting a few days. Only a low proportion of the plants in a colony produce flowers and the non-flowering plants usually appear after flowering is finished. Nervilia flowers are pollinated by small bees or wasps. The flowers of many species are brightly coloured and fragrant, but do not produce nectar. The lateral lobes of the labellum closely embrace the column and a visiting insect must force its way between the column and labellum to enter the flower. The column has a sunken stigma that is narrow at the base and widens towards the top, and a prominently protruding rostellum which can smear glue onto the insect. The anther cap is hinged and can pivot on contact with an insect, sliding the pollinia onto a glue-smeared patch on the thorax. The pollinia are picked up by the insect when backing out of a flower and deposited on the stigma when entering another flower. The flower stem elongates considerably within a few days of pollination and prior to seed dispersal."," grassy or forested areas, along stream banks and rainforest margins. flowering plants are not commonly seen in the wild since they appear rapidly after the first heavy rains of the wet season and are short-lived, usually only lasting a few days.",Flora_of_Australia,,,
Species,Nitraria billardierei,"Rounded, sprawling, untidy and impenetrable woody shrubs, up to 2 m high and 5 m wide, spiny on some branch ends. Young branches closely appressed-pubescent with white hairs, glabrous with age; bark white initially, eventually pale grey. Leaves in whorls of 3-6, thick, narrowly obovate, 1-4 cm long, attenuate, entire, acute, initially densely appressed-pubescent, eventually glabrous, green or grey-green; stipules triangular. Flowers unisexual or bisexual on any one bush, sometimes mixed. Sepals united at base; lobes 0.5-1.5 mm long, acute or acuminate. Petals 2.5-3.5 mm long. Fertile stamens 11-15 in male or bisexual flowers; filaments 3-4 mm long, exceeding petals and stigma; staminodes 11-15 in female flowers, of similar height to stigma. Ovary densely white-appressed-pubescent; hairs continuous about stigma lobes. Fruit ovoid, 1-2 cm long, initially green, green-yellow, red or purple when ripe. Clearance of Nitraria billardierei for control of feral species is often a controversial subject. It has been allowed in some parts of South AustraliaÂ under State legislation but permission still needs to be sought from the Native Vegetation Council. Leaves and inflorescences often have gall-like infestations and these may well prove of interest since gall-forming armoured scale insects (Diaspidiotus species) have been documented on Nitraria species elsewhere (E.M. Danzig, J. Zoosyst. Rossica 8: 287-289 (1999). Similarly, the sphecid wasps Solierella nitraria Pulawski and Cerceris nitrariae Morice (R.M. Bohart & A.S. Menke, Sphecid wasps of the world: a generic revision (1976)) described from Egypt and Morocco respectively, were named for their association with Nitraria species and it would be interesting to see whether these same associations occur in Australian populations. The fruits of N. billardierei are edible and particularly attractive to emus, and possibly to rock-parrots (S.A. White, Emu 16: 1-15 (1916)), but are also taken by kangaroos, sheep, rabbits, lizards and decorator ants; germination was found to be enhanced after passage through an emu (J.C. Noble, J. Ecol. 63: 979-984 (1975)). N. billardierei fruits have also been recorded as part of the diet of Australian Aborigines (B. Gott, Telopea 12: 215-226 (2008)) and have been eaten without any ill effects by the author. They have potential for development as a native food, although a little salty. Possibly not distinct from the Russian species N. schoberi. While there is a documented chromosome number differenceÂ (2n = 24 for N. schoberi and 2n = 48 for N. billardierei), morphological differences, including spininess and leaf and floral characteristics, have not been investigated fully. Morphological differences, including habit and size of the stones, were documented by Noble & Whalley (1978a) between the populations of N. billardierei occurring along the Indian Ocean and those which occur along the Southern Ocean. Again, a molecular study across the range of the species could prove useful, particularly given the expanding distribution in inland areas.

Genus,Taeniophyllum,"Small leafless epiphytic orchids with flat, round or triangular (cross-section) green roots (photosynthetic). Stems almost vestigial. Racemes thin, glabrous or hairy; rachis with prominent bracts, continuing growth and flowering intermittently. Flowers resupinate, small, 1-3 open at once, often tubular with spreading tips, sometimes opening widely, lasting 1-3 days. Sepals and petals either fused at base or free and spreading widely. Labellum fixed to base of very short column by top of spur. Labellum lamina unlobed or 3-lobed; midlobe often with short apical tooth-like appendage. Column short without basal foot. Pollinia four, orange, hard, waxy, sessile, attached via stipe to viscidium. These orchids grow in moist humid scrub and rainforest. Some species colonise twigs of outer canopy of shrubs and trees, whereas others grow on thicker branches and trunks. Notes Taeniophyllum is the largest group of leafless orchids in the tribe Vandeae (Carlsward et al. 2006). Their roots contain chlorophyll and take over the role of leaves. The true leaves are actually reduced to tiny overlapping brownish scales that cover the stem apex. Most species grow as epiphytes on twigs and small branches. Their flowers are generally short-lived, lasting from a few hours to a few days, and produced sporadically on the raceme. Some species open their flowers at night, others during the day. A few species of Taeniophyllum, such as T. malianum, exhibit gregarious flowering whereby, following a particular stimulus such as heavy rain, all plants in an area flower simultaneously. Poll. Most of the Australian species of Taeniophyllum are insect-pollinated, whereas the flowers of T. muelleri appear be self-pollinating or possibly apomictic.","these orchids grow in moist humid scrub and rainforest. a few species of taeniophyllum, such as malianum, exhibit gregarious flowering whereby, following a particular stimulus such as heavy rain, all plants in an area flower simultaneously.",Flora_of_Australia,,,

This species is termed a 'resurrection plant' as it is able to produce green leaf from dry butts, and flowers and fruits in a very short time after rain. Morphologically this species is very variable. Throughout the majority of its range T. loliiformis is characterised by short dense inflorescences with overlapping spikelets, e.g. D.J.Nelson 2293. In the east of the country (on the tablelands around Atherton in north-eastern Qld and the tablelands from southern Qld through to Vic.) specimens grade to having longer, less dense inflorescences with spikelets that are slightly overlapping to distant, e.g. A.C.Beauglehole 30668. This eastern group appears to have affinities with T. spicatus (Nees) Ekman (M.Lazarides, pers. comm.) from southern U.S.A. and Central and South America. The syntypes of Tripogon loliiformis cover the range of variation described above including the gradation between groups. Further taxonomic work is required to ascertain if T. spicatus can be applied to the eastern Australian material. For the present all material has been treated as Tripogon loliiformis.

Pedicel 2.5 mm long in flower. Sepals 4, 1-2 mm long. Petals 4, obovate, usually narrowly so, 1.2-2.5 mm long, similar in length to or just longer than sepals, yellow drying white, or ?white. Stamens 4; filaments 1.2-1.5 mm long, narrowly winged in lower half, without appendages. DiscÂ  4-lobed; lobes free, oblong. Ovary 4-angled, 4-celled, sometimes papillose on angles; stigma minutely 4-lobed. Capsule 5-7.5 mm long, 4-7 mm wide, 4-angled, 4-celled, obliquely truncate at apex; pedicel 3.5-4.5 mm long; fruiting style 0.3 mm long. Seeds 2 (-4) per cell, 2-3 mm long, covered with longitudinal rows of tuberculae. Chippendale et al. (Austral. Veterin. J. 40: 241 (1964)) recorded Z. ammophilum as killing a number of cattle near Mt Lloyd Bore, just W of Alice Springs, in 1963. It needs to be established which of the Z. ammophilum segregates was involved here but it seems likely that all of the group would have the same effect. The deaths were attributed to nitrate poisoning. Eichler (Telopea 4: 16 (1990)) stated that both Z. ammophilum and Z. simile differed from the rest of the species in this subgroup by possessing white rather than yellow flowers. Information given on some collections supports this statement but there are others where the flowers are recorded as yellow. Since flowers usually turn from yellow to white with age in Australian species further field observations are needed if this characteristic is to be used with confidence. Other distinguishing characters listed included the shape of the petals and number of seeds per cell of the capsule, but these too seem to be somewhat questionable. At the moment the differing stamen number is the only sure means of distinction and consequently those specimens lacking flowers are not determinable to species and even those which do have flowers are difficult to determine without a microscope. Eichler (Telopea 4: 16 (1990)) also indicated that Z. ammophilum was confined to SE Australia but there are definitely specimens with 4 stamens from W.A. Inlimestone or hardened clay soils, in Astrebla or in chenopodshrubland.Â  Flowers predominantly July-Nov., but collections from earlier in theyear, particularly from inland areas, may also have flowers, probably inresponse to rain."," flowers predominantly july-nov., but collections from earlier in theyear, particularly from inland areas, may also have flowers, probably inresponse to rain.",ABRS_2022,,rain,
Species,Zygophyllum aurantiacum,"Low, spreading, straggly but intricately branched, woody but brittle undershrub, usuallyÂ  30-50 cm high, to 1 m wide, occasionally sprawling in other shrubs. Leaves sessile and simple or petiolate and with 2 leaflets, but petiole varying in length and width; leaflets succulent, continuous with petiole, obtuse, truncate, emarginate or, rarely, 3-lobed at apex. Pedicel 3-14.5 mm long in flower, erect. Sepals 4, 4-7.5 mm long. Petals 4, obovate, clawed, 5.5-11 mm long, longer than sepals, yellow drying white. Stamens 8; filaments 3.5-5.2 mm long, unequal, not winged, without appendages. Disc 4-lobed; lobes free, semicircular, succulent, papillose on margin. Ovary 4-angled, 4-celled, glabrous; style 2.2-5.5 mm long; stigma minutely capitate, not lobed. Fruit pendent, 4-winged, 4-celled, subcircular to transversely broadly elliptic, 8-20 mm long, rounded but deeply emarginate at apex, breaking into 4 single winged fruitlets; wing with very closely spaced reticulate venation, appearing almost parallel when dry; pedicel 9.5-15 mm long; fruiting style 2.6-5 mm long. Seed 0 or 1 per cell, linear to narrowly elliptic, 3.2-5.6 mm long, pale brown. There are 4 subspecies.  Distinct from Z. eremaeum by the dissociation of its fruits, a character which is not always easily determined in young fruit. The size of the flowers and the length of the style, more than 2.5 mm in the Z. aurantiacum sub-group compared with 1 mm in Z. eremaeum, are characters which are more easily used for distinguishing between the species. Zygophyllum aurantiacum is a variable species with respect to leaf and petiole ratios. The typical subspecies is always petiolate with 2 leaflets to give a Y-shape, but the other subspecies are a variation of this Y-shape. In subsp. verticillatum the lobing is to the base of the leaf so that the leaf is apparently sessile and there appear to be 4 simple leaves at a node; subsp. simplicifolium is unlobed or virtually so at the apex and so appears to either be a simple, sessile leaf with an emarginate apex or an extremely long-petioled leaf with 2 very short leaflets, while subsp. cuneatum maintains the Y-shape but is much more flattened and broader than the typical subspecies (see fig. 84). These leaf differences are associated with soil type, with the 3 atypical subspecies associated with gypseous or calcareous areas; they are the only obvious distinction between the subspecies and intermediate leaf types are common. Foundin sand, usually associated with mallee scrubs.Â  Flowers predominantly July-Oct.for all of the subspecies, with records outside these months being due tosummer rains."," flowers predominantly july-oct.for all of the subspecies, with records outside these months being due tosummer rains.",ABRS_2022,,rain,

Basal leaves lanceolate to linear, to 2-5 cm long, 1-5 mm wide, glabrous, margins toothed. Flowers single in axils of leaf-like bracts; pedicels 8-25 mm long. Sepals 4-6 mm long; corolla 6-12 mm long, blue-purple, lower lip spreading, somewhat recurved, with 2 long white, rarely suffused, streaks behind the lower clefts. Capsule 5-6 mm long. Flower most of year (following rain). MuF, MuM, MSB, RobP. All mainland states. Apparently very rare in Victoria where known with certainty only from clay soils on banks or floodplains of the Murray River near Cohuna, Kerang and Piangil areas and the extreme north-west corner of the State. Stemodia glabella in eastern Australia encompasses several variants, possibly warranting formal recognition, differing in flowers being subsessile or long pedicellate, upper leaves small and/or narrow or long and relatively broad, and sepal indumentum varying in presence and extent of gland dots, aculeate excrescences and tiny glandular hairs.",flower most of year (following rain).,RBGV_2022,,rain_all_year,
Species,Swainsona adenophylla,"Erect or spreading perennial herb, to c. 30 cm tall; stems densely pubescent with appressed medifixed hairs. Leaves mostly 3-5 cm long; leaflets 3-9, linear to narrow-ovate, lateral leaflets 15-25 mm long, mostly 0.5-2 mm wide, apices obtuse with a yellowish, orbicular terminal gland, both surfaces densely pubescent; stipules to c. 4 mm long. Racemes mostly 10-20-flowered; flowers 6-9 mm long; calyx pubescent, teeth shorter than tube; petals pink or purplish; standard 7-9 mm long, 6-8 mm wide, suborbicular, clawed; keel c. 7 mm long, obtuse or acute, slightly twisted in older flowers; style tapering, tip straight or minutely inflexed. Pod narrow-obloid, mostly 10-20 mm long, 3-4 mm wide, pubescent; stipe to c. 0.5 mm long; seeds to c. 8, cuboid-cordate, 2-2.5 mm long, olive-green to light brown. Flowers Jun.-Sep.

Species,Vittadinia pterochaeta,"Annual or biennial, to c. 30 cm high; stems with sparse to mid-dense, stiff, forwardly appressed hairs, usually mixed with sessile glands. Leaves narrowly oblanceolate to oblong, 3-30 mm long, 1-5 mm wide, often longitudinally folded; margins entire (rarely 1-2-toothed near apex); surfaces sparsely appressed-hirsute; apex acute, recurved. Involucral bracts oblong, 2-7 mm long, with minute glandular hairs all over, and a midline of longer simple hairs, ciliate at apex; ray florets pale to deep lilac, ligules 1-2 mm long. Cypsela narrowly turbinate to obconic, 3.5-4.5 mm long, unribbed, evenly covered with short, subappressed hairs; pappus bristles plumose, 4-5 mm long. Flowers Oct.-Jan. (but probably dependent on summer rain). MuM, VRiv, Wim. AlsoÂ NT, SA, Qld, NSW. Very rare in Victoria, known by only a few collections in the Quambatook-Leaghur region, near Warracknabeal and Wallpolla Island west of Mildura. Apparently confined to relatively fertile clay-loam soils.",(but probably dependent on summer rain).,RBGV_2022,,rain_summer,
