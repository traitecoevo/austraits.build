  description: Dataset capturing rain and flood-related flowering cues from Australia's
    state and national online floras.
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: All phrases related to flowering time that included either the
    word 'rain' or 'flood' were extracted from Australia's online state and national
    floras. These phrases were manually scored to align with the trait 'flowering
    cues', specifically capturing phrases that indicate if taxa only flower following
    rain, if flowering is enhanced following rain, and if there are particular seasons
    during which taxa respond to rainfall by flowering.
