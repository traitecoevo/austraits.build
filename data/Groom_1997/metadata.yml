  description: data on reproductive traits of non-sprouting and re-sprouting Hakea
    species in southwestern Australia
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: Twenty follicles of 94 Hakea species (out of a possible 100)
    were collected from natural populations within southwestern Australia. Fruit and
    seed attributes and germination parameters of 50 species of Hakea - 24 non-sprouters
    (NS) and 26 resprouters (RS) were recorded, the species ccollected from various
    localities within the South-West Botanical Province. All sites had not been burnt
    for at least the past 10-15 years. Species were selected to provide a range of
    fruit and seed masses to enable comparison of subgeneric sections and sister species.

traits:
- var_in: seed_mass_mg
  unit_in: mg
  trait_name: seed_dry_mass
  value_type: site_mean
  replicates: 5
  methods: Seeds were extracted from opening follicles and weighed (fresh weight)
    after removal of the seed wing. Seed body mass (embryo plus testa) was used as
    measure of seed size, due to implications of embryo size on germination and seedling
    ecology (Jurado and Westoby 1992). Fresh mass rather than dry mass was measured
    as seeds were to be germinated.
- var_in: regeneration_mode
  unit_in: .na
  trait_name: regen_strategy
  value_type: expert_mean
  replicates: .na
  methods: Data relating to regenerative mode and fruit production were compiled from
    observations in the field. Regenerative mode was determined by digging around
    the base of the stem to see if a lignotuber or sucker was present. Plants were
    also examined to determine whether they had resprouted via epicormic buds. Non-sprouters
    typicallv were single stemmed at the base and lignotuberous resprouters were multi-stemmed.
    Where possible, regenerative mode was confirmed by examining burnt plants at nearby
    locations.

- var_in: serotiny_level
  unit_in: .na
  trait_name: serotiny
  value_type: expert_mean
  replicates: .na
  methods: 'Each species was then categorized into one of four levels of serotiny
    based on the condition of the follicles on branchlets of known age (after Cowling
    & Lamont 1985). The categories were: nonserotinous (fruits open at maturity);
    weakly serotinous (majority of fruit open within a year of maturity); moderately
    serotinous (fruits open within five years of maturity); and strongly serotinous
    (fruits remain closed at least 5 years after reaching maturity).'
- var_in: fruit_length_mm
  unit_in: mm
  trait_name: fruit_length
  value_type: site_mean
  replicates: 5
  methods: For each species, follicles were collected from at least five representative
    plants. Follicle length, width and height (Fig. 1) were measured with calipers
    on 20 unopened follicles. Follicles were dried in a 30 deg C chamber for 2-4 weeks,
    after which any remaining closed follicles were manually opened.
- var_in: fruit_width_mm
  unit_in: mm
  trait_name: fruit_width
  value_type: site_mean
  replicates: 5
  methods: For each species, follicles were collected from at least five representative
    plants. Follicle length, width and height (Fig. 1) were measured with calipers
    on 20 unopened follicles. Follicles were dried in a 30 deg C chamber for 2-4 weeks,
    after which any remaining closed follicles were manually opened.
- var_in: fruit_mass_mg
  unit_in: mg
  trait_name: fruit_dry_mass
  value_type: site_mean
  replicates: 5
  methods: For each species, follicles were collected from at least five representative
    plants. Follicle length, width and height (Fig. 1) were measured with calipers
    on 20 unopened follicles. Follicles were dried in a 30 deg C chamber for 2-4 weeks,
    after which any remaining closed follicles were manually opened. Follicle mass
    was obtained after drying at 60 deg C for 1 week.

  methods: expert observation and reference books
- var_in: '%_germinated'
  unit_in: '%'
  trait_name: germination
  value_type: experiment_mean
  replicates: 30
  methods: Thirty seeds were used to compare percentage germination and rates of germination
    between species. Seeds were soaked in tap water containing a wetting agent for
    30 minutes prior to placement in petri dishes lined with moist filter paper. Seeds
    were maintained at 15 deg C in a germination cabinet with the number of new germinants
    recorded every second day. No new germinants were recorded after 50 days from
    soaking. From this data, two independent germination indices were measured - germination
    speed and germinability (Thomson and El-Kassaby 1993). Germination speed (the
    maximum quotient derived by dividing the cumulative proportion of germinants by
    the corresponding number of days) was calculated based on the total number of
    seeds germinations. Germinability was equivalent to total number of germinated
    seeds, expressed as a percentage of the original number of seeds used. The number
    of days to first germinations, 50% germination (of germinated seeds) and between
    first and last germination were also recorded.
