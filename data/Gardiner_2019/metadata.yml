  description: We took advantage of a large monitoring dataset (~7,000 native trees
    from 23 species) to interrogate an extensive suite of environmental conditions
    and plant characteristics that potentially contributed to poor survival and growth
    of seedlings in a restoration planting in southeast Queensland, Australia.
  collection_type: field_experiment
  sample_age_class: juvenile
  sampling_strategy: This study focuses on the short-term outcomes of a restoration
    experiment embedded within a larger project that aimed to restore a corridor of
    riparian rainforest in Southeast Queensland, Australia. The experiment was replicated
    across 1.5 km of formerly-grazed alluvial floodplain that encompasses considerable
    variation in soil physical and chemical properties and microtopography. In addition,
    planting took place over a two-week period and temperatures on some days were
    well above average. A 'trait targets' approach (Laughlin 2014) was used to generate
    two experimental assemblages with distinct trait profiles; a fast assemblage comprising
    more resource acquisitive species, and a hardy assemblage comprising species with
    more conservative strategies (see Appendix S1 in Supporting Information). Each
    assemblage had 16 species and similar species evenness. Fast and Hardy assemblages
    each had eight species unique to them and the remaining eight were common to both
    assemblages, resulting in a total of 24 species. The areas available for planting
    were mainly confined to a 50 m wide strip of alluvial floodplain (Fig. S1) that
    was previously managed as beef cattle pasture. To capture environmental variation
    across the site, and variation between grazing units (paddocks), a randomised
    block design that included ten blocks distributed along the entire extent of the
    available planting area was implemented. Each block contained two plots to which
    the two mixes were randomly assigned. Each plot was 30 x 30 m with 400 trees planted
    in a grid at 1.5 m spacing. Leaf, stem and root traits were measured on well-watered,
    sun-hardened seedlings of each species. Five replicate seedlings were sampled,
    except for three species that had four replicate seedlings.

  Oxley Creek Common:
    latitude (deg): -27.537659
    longitude (deg): 152.990117
    precipitation, MAP (mm): 1058
    description: The study site is in the inner southern suburbs of Brisbane, Queensland,
      Australia and is known locally as Oxley Creek Common (27 deg 32'S 152 deg 59'E,
      Fig. S1). It is situated on an alluvial floodplain along a section of Oxley
      Creek, approximately 2 km from its confluence with the Brisbane River to the
      north. Rainfall averages 1058 mm yr-1 and is typically summer dominant with
      extended dry periods in late winter and early spring (July-September). Mean
      daily minimum and daily maximum temperatures are 14.4 deg C and 26.4 deg C respectively
      (station number 40211; Australian Government Bureau of Meteorology 2017). Oxley
      Creek Common comprises infrequently inundated pasture and parklands on dermosols.
      Prior to European settlement the areas adjacent to Oxley Creek most likely supported
      gallery notophyll vine forest (Regional Ecosystem 12.3.1) (Queensland Herbarium
      2018). While the region receives less rainfall than is typically used to define
      rainforest in the tropics, this type of vegetation is commonly referred to as
      riparian subtropical rainforest in Australia. Established in November 2016,
      the experiment was embedded within a larger project funded by the Australian
      Government's National Landcare Programme '20 Million Trees Round II'.

    Leaves were oven-dried at 60 deg C for 72 hours before being reweighed to obtain
    the leaf dry mass. SLA was calculated as the one-sided leaf area divided by the
    leaf dry mass (mm2mg-1), and LDMC as the oven dry mass divided by fresh leaf mass
    (mg g1). Wood density was calculated as dry mass of wood per unit of volume (mg
    mm-3). One wood sample was cut from the base of each seedling (average stem sample
    diameter of approximately 4 mm). Secondary phloem and bark were removed before
    volume was determined via water displacement (Perez-Harguindeguy et al. 2013).
    Wood samples were oven dried at 105 deg C for 72 hours and then retained at room
    temperature for 1-2 minutes before weighing. The values of these 3 samples was
    averaged by an AusTraits data processesor.

  methods: Total root length and root volume were measured from fresh, washed root
    material, which was scanned for each seedling and analysed using WinRhizo image
    analysis software (Regent Instruments Inc, Quebec, Canada). Following a preliminary
    root wash, small samples of the finest living roots in each root system were selected
    and further washed in deionized water. All effort was made to select absorptive
    roots, however some samples may have included structural or transport roots. Roots
    were scanned at 720 dpi using an EPSON Expression 11000XL LA2500 scanner (EPSON,
    Suwa, Japan). Based on the estimated mean root diameter for each scanned sample,
    the overall mean (across species) was 0.3 mm, and species' means ranged from 0.193
    mm for Melaleuca bracteata to 0.505 mm for Toona ciliata. Roots were then oven
    dried at 60 deg C for 48 hours before weighing to obtain their dry mass. Specific
    root length (SRL) was calculated as root length divided by the root dry mass (m
    g-1) and root tissue density (RTD) was calculated as root dry mass divided by
    fresh root volume (mg mm-3).
