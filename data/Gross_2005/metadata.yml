  sampling_strategy: RAINFOREST TYPES IN AUSTRALIA-Rainforests in the Australian context,
    and as summarized by Adam (1992), are comprised of a forest with a closed canopy
    (70-100% foliage cover, although some species may be deciduous), in contrast with
    the more extensive Eucalyptus-dominated sclerophyll forests and woodlands, which
    have more open canopies and pendant leaves. Rainforest types in Australia are
    usually further divided by geographical position (e.g., tropical, subtropical,
    warm temperate, cool temperate) or more usefully by structural types (e.g., mesophyll
    vine forest, after Webb, 1978 and see Adam, 1992). In this study the term tropical
    rainforest is used broadly to cover many different structural types of rainforest
    (see Webb, 1978) found north of the Tropic of Capricorn. The subtropical rainforests
    referred to in this study are lowland closed-canopy forests found south of the
    Tropic of Capricorn, but not beyond southern New South Wales. The terms dry rainforest
    or monsoonal forest (the vine forests of Webb, 1978) are used by some authors
    to describe deciduous and semi-evergreen vine thickets found in tropical and subtropical
    areas of Australia. Adam (1992) estimates that there is c. 2 million hectares
    of rainforest remaining in Australia-this is an area less than 1% of the continent.
    Further discussion of rainforests types and composition can be found in Adam (1992).
    AUSTRALIAN BIOME DATA-Sex system information was collected for 1113 tree species
    in the rainforest systems in tropical northern Australia (North of 19 deg S across
    Queensland, [Qld], Northern Territory [NT] and Western Australia [WA]). The initial
    list of tree species was compiled from Hyland et al. (1999), with additional species
    being added later using Hyland et al. (2003) and expert opinion (Appendix I).
    Each species was determined as native or endemic to Australia using Hyland et
    al. (2003). Introduced species (c. 32) were not considered further. The type of
    sex system for each species was determined from field and herbarium collections,
    published taxonomic treatments, expert opinion, or from the Flora of Australia
    series, Morley and Toelken (1983), or Hyland et al. (2003).

  methods: Fruit type can be correlated with sex system, particularly the dioecious
    habit (e.g., Bawa, 1980) but correlations between these traits can reflect shared
    evolutionary history (discussed later) or ecological convergence. To look for
    any correlation between fruit type and sexual system, data about fruit types (dry-indehiscent,
    dry-dehiscent, fleshy) were collected for the Australian data and analyzed with
    sex system using x2 contingency analyses and phylogenetic clustering techniques
    (discussed later). Fruit information was derived from the Flora of Australia series,
    Morley and Toelken (1983), taxonomic treatments, or from Hyland et al. (2003).

  methods: All species were classified into one of three sex systems, hermaphroditic,
    dioecious, or monoecious. The hermaphrodite category includes all flowers bisexual
    on a plant (hermaphroditic, i) including all monostylous and heterostylous hermaphroditic
    species. In the dioecious category, female and male flowers are found on separate
    individuals and the category includes androdioecious species. In the monoecious
    category, male and female flowers are found as separate flowers on the same individual.
    Andromonoecious and polygamomonoecious (bisexual as well as unisexual staminate
    and pistillate flowers on the same individual) species are included in this category.
    For some species, the type of unisexual system was poorly known or there was disagreement
    in the literature about the type of sex system. This occurs, for example, when
    a species is poorly represented by fertile collections, and temporal monoecy is
    mistaken for dioecy. It can also occur when flowers are cryptically polymorphic,
    e.g., when morphologically monomorphic flowers facilitate mistake pollination,
    but the flowers are actually cryptically dimorphic (see Cox, 1988). It more often
    occurs because many species exhibit a continuum between sexual states (e.g., Lloyd,
    1972), a phenomenon recognized by Darwin (1877) and studied by many (see Richards,
    1986 for a review). The sex system of species, when unclear in the literature,
    was clarified in most cases with herbarium or fresh-population collections.
