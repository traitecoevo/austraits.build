  description: In this study, Eucalyptus and Acacia were collected along a south-north
    gradient from winter- to summer-dominated rainfall to investigate whether trait
    values indicate why these genera dominate across different parts of Australia
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: In July and August 2010, leaves of Eucalyptus (and the closely-related
    Corymbia) and of Acacia (and the closelyrelated Vachellia, as well as associated
    woody Fabaceae) were sampled in the field along a south-north transect in Western
    Australia, starting at Lancelin and Southern Cross in the south (31 deg S) and
    terminating in the north at Wyndham (15 deg S). A total of 140 woody species were
    sampled, 62 belonging to non-nitrogen-fixing species, mainly of the genus Eucalyptus,
    and 78 potentially nitrogen-fixing woody Fabaceae, mainly of the genus Acacia.
    Plants were collected at 64 sites, which were chosen depending on uniformity of
    vegetation, and mainly on flat topography in valleys, on plateaus or on hilltops,
    and covering the range of woody species in each region. Sampling sites were generally
    far from settlements, but dust from unsealed roads could not always be avoided.
    For Eucalyptus, additional samples were taken from a common garden, which occurs
    in a winter-dominated rainfall region (near Adelaide) and which contains about
    800 eucalypt species (Currency Creek Arboretum, Nicolle 2003). The garden cannot
    sustain summer rainfall species and it has no plantation of Acacia. The common
    garden allows comparison of traits of field-grown specimens with a common environmental
    background as a baseline, to which these species may be adapted or not (Schulze
    et al. 2006a, b).

  methods: At each site, fully-developed leaves were sampled from the sun-lit part
    of the crown. These leaves were assumed to have grown 12 months prior to the sampling.
    The samples were stored in paper bags for rapid drying. Most species were evergreen
    with fairly tough (sclerophyllous) foliage and very little change in leaf area
    with drying. In the laboratory, leaf area was measured with a leaf area meter
    (Model 3100, Li-COR. Lincoln, Nebraska, USA). For a small number of species, this
    is the area of a leaflet; for these observations, there is a note in the comlumn
    'lab Remarks' in the data.csv file.

  methods: The genus Acacia has been shown to be capable of fixing N2, but the rates
    depend on the environmental conditions (Brockwell et al. 2005). It may also be
    species specific within Acacia. Thus, we refer to the leguminous species (Fabaceae)
    as being potentially N2-fixing species. We were not able to directly test for
    N2 fixation (e.g. by inspection of nodulation) of any species in the field due
    to the difficulties in terrain.

    The samples were stored in paper bags for rapid drying. Most species were evergreen
    with fairly tough (sclerophyllous) foliage and very little change in leaf area
    with drying. For all samples, voucher herbarium specimens were collected, pressed
    and dried. In the laboratory, leaf area was measured with a leaf area meter (Model
    3100, Li-COR. Lincoln, Nebraska, USA). Leaves were dried to constant mass in a
    forced draught oven at 70 deg C and specific leaf area (SLA) was calculated.

    analysis (Elementar Vario ELII, Elementar Analyzer Systems GmbH, Hanau, Germany),
    and phosphorous was measured using ICP-AES Optima 3300DV, Perkin-Elmer, Waltham,
    Mass., USA.
