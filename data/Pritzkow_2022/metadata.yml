  description: X-ray computed tomography (microCT) images were obtained from different
    aged branch xylem to study the number, size and spatial distribution of in situ
    embolized conduits among three dominant tree species growing in a woodland community.
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: unknown
  sampling_strategy: We performed the experiments early in the austral spring prior
    to the onset of new leaf and stem extension growth to determine the amount of
    residual embolism. Because of the mild winter temperatures, we could be fairly
    confident that most of the observable embolism was drought induced as opposed
    to freeze-thaw embolism formation. All trees were sampled within a 200 m radius
    on an overcast day (8 October 2019). Cut branches were double bagged with wet
    tissue and were transported within 2 h of collection to the laboratory in Hobart.
    Two branches bearing green foliage were selected from two trees of the following
    three dominant species- the angiosperms Eucalyptus pulchella Desf. (Myrtaceae)
    and Acacia mearnsii De Wild. (Fabaceae) and the conifer Callitris rhomboidea R.Br.
    ex Rich. & A.Rich. (Cupressaceae).

    description: evergreen dry sclerophyll woodland
    notes: We selected an evergreen dry sclerophyll woodland in the Central East of
      Tasmania, Australia. The average temperature during summer is 17 °C, with an
      occasional daily maximum of 40 °C. Overall, mean temperatures (measured at the
      Swansea weather station <10 km away, Australian Bureau of Meteorology) slightly
      increased over the last 60 years, resulting in only a few mild frost days (0
      to -2 °C) in recent winters. Over the last 3 years, this site has received less
      than the average annual precipitation (550 mm), leading to drier than normal
      conditions, which is reflected in a negative three monthly averaged Standardized
      Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI3) (Vicente-Serrano et  al., 2010).
      The SPEI3 indicates that drought is a common feature of the site and has increased
      in frequency and intensity in the last years.

  methods: The percentage of embolized vessels and the percentage loss of conductance
    (PLC) are calculated in relation to the control scans (100 % embolized). During
    May-August 2020, three trees per species were sampled to quantify the branch vulnerability
    to embolism during rapid dehydration under laboratory conditions. The preceding
    6 months had above average rainfall, thus enabling branches to be collected with
    new growth that had not been subjected to prior water stress. Branches of similar
    length to those described above were collected, double bagged with wet tissue
    and transported to Hobart. The optical vulnerability technique, as described in
    Brodribb et al. (2016b) and Johnson et al. (2020), was used on 3-5 mm wide branches
    to measure the vulnerability to embolism for all species. To capture embolism
    events, we removed the bark and covered the exposed xylem in hydrogel (Tensive,
    Parker Laboratories Inc., Fairfeld, NJ, USA). The branches were then secured in
    3-D printed clamps with a light source and camera (Cavicam, Hobart, Tasmania,
    Australia) (Johnson et al., 2020). The light within the Cavicams illuminated the
    branch during branch dehydration so that the camera could capture the branch surface.
    Pictures were taken every 3 min and stored on an SD card until full branch dehydration
    was achieved. A stem psychrometer (PSY1, ICT International, Armidale, NSW, Australia)
    or periodic water potential measurements with a pressure chamber were used to
    monitor the decline in water potential during the dehydration. Images were processed
    following the guidelines described at www.opensourceov.org and Brodribb et  al.
    (2016a). In short, all images were processed by extracting the image difference
    between subsequent images in ImageJ (version 1.52a, Schneider et al., 2012). Image
    thresholding was used to count the number and size of embolism events throughout
    the dehydration process.

  methods: The percentage of embolized area is calculated as the percentage of embolized
    area relative to the total sapwood area in all native scans. During May-August

    thresholding was used to count the number and size of embolism events throughout
    the dehydration process. The amount of embolized pixel area was extracted from
    each image and expressed as a percentage of total embolized pixel area to relate
    the increase in embolism percentage to time.

  methods: All microCT images were analysed in ImageJ version 1.52a by first identifying
    the pixels representing embolized conduits through the Renyi Entropy auto thresholding
    algorithm (Kapur et  al., 1985). Following this, conduits were separated manually
    and by using the watershed algorithm (Sage and Unser, 2001). The xylem area, conduit
    area and number were obtained for each native and control image and used to determine
    the theoretical sapwood area-specifc hydraulic conductance (Ktheo, kg m-1 MPa-1
    s-1). Refer to the paper for the formula used to calculate Ktheo. Light microscopy
    images of the scan positions suggest that a small proportion of Eucalyptus vessels
    were potentially flled with tyloses and thus unable to conduct water (Jacobsen
    et al., 2018). These vessels appeared grey, instead of black in the microCT control
    scan and could therefore be removed from the analysis by the automatic thresholding
    algorithm.

  methods: A reference scan showing 100 % embolism was made by cutting each branch
    close to the scan positions and rescanning all previously imaged scan positions
    (control scan), allowing us to estimate the total functional vessel number. All

    was extracted from each image and expressed as a percentage of total embolized

    the linear relationship between water potential and time from the psychrometer
    and pressure chamber readings was used to predict the water potential for each
    embolism event (Fig. 2B). All tree-level vulnerability curves can be viewed in
    Supplementary data Fig. S2. The inflection point, P50, was predicted from this
    relationship.
