  description: trait data for species at Round Hill and Trangie from Peter Vesk
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: Nine sites were located within ca 5 km of each other in Round
    Hill-Nombinnie Nature Reserve (33 deg 21' S, 146 deg 01' E) and one site, 35 km
    to the east (33 deg 1'26' S, 146 deg 30'56' E), was in a 120 ha exclosure that
    was fenced in 1950 (Cunningham and Milthorpe 1981). sites were selected to maximize
    the number of species sampled and species were not sampled at more than one site.
    Soil types covered a range of loamy red sands, light red clays and light red brown
    earths (Cohn 1995). Species We sampled common species of plants that had individuals
    less than 1.5 m tall, as these might be exposed to browsing by mammalian herbivores,
    primarily western grey kangaroos Macropus fuliginosus and feral goats Capra hircus.
    Ephemeral species were excluded. In all, 45 species were treated, representing
    10 grasses, 11 forbs, 7 sub-shrubs of the Chenopodiaceae and 17 woody shrubs and
    trees (Appendix 1). Nomenclature follows the Australian Plant Name Index online
    database (APNI) (Chapman 1991).

    description: Round Hill Nature reserve, NSW. The climate is warm and semi-arid.
      The closest meteorological station, Mt. Hope 30 km north-west, has median annual
      rainfall of 370 mm (220- 595, 1st to 9th deciles), and mean maximum daily temperatures
      ranging from 14.28C in July to 32.58C in February (Fig. 1). Monthly rainfall
      is relatively evenly distributed throughout the year, but is associated with
      patchy thunderstorms in summer and persistent but less intense fronts in winter.
      The area comprises low hills and foot-slopes, plains and dune fields, with dominant
      vegetation types open Callitris glaucophylla -Eucalyptus populnea woodland and
      Eucalyptus dumosa -E. socialis shrub mallee woodland (Cohn 1995). Wildfire in
      open woodland recurs every 5_/20 years when years of above average rainfall
      allow sufficient grass (Stipa spp. ) fuel to build up (Walker et al. 1981, reviewed
      by Hobbs 2002). In these fires, mature trees may escape total leaf scorch, while
      shrubs and ground storey commonly experience total leaf scorch. Mallee woodland
      experiences fire with a similar mean frequency, though with less variable inter-fire
      periods as Triodia scariosa (porcupine grass) fuel breaks down more slowly than
      Stipa spp. in open woodland and so is retained over a number of years (Bradstock
      1989, Noble 1989, Bradstock and Cohn 2002). In mallee fires, all growth forms
      commonly experience total leaf scorch, allowing for patchiness in intensity,
      in turn dependent upon the balance More info on Round Hill Sites in Cohn, J.

traits:
- var_in: specific_leaf_area_mm2/mg
  unit_in: mm2/mg
  trait_name: specific_leaf_area
  value_type: raw_value
  replicates: 1
  methods: Leaf size was optically scanned for at least two leaves from each of five
    individuals, and areas per leaf in mm2 were calculated using Delta-T Scan (Kirchhof
    and Pendar 1993). After drying for at least 24 h at c. 65 deg C, dry masses were
    measured and SLA calculated as area divided by dry mass (mm2 mg-1).
- var_in: leaf_dry_matter_content_g/g
  unit_in: g/g
  trait_name: leaf_dry_matter_content
  value_type: raw_value
  replicates: 1
  methods: At least two leaves were collected from each of five individuals. After
    collection, leaves were first allowed to rehydrate over night between layers of
    damp paper towel at 4 deg. C. then fresh masses were measured. Further all leaves
    were dried for 5 days at 65 deg C before weighing dry. Leaf dry matter content
    was calculated as DM/FM.

    on tall individuals in the vicinity.

    Plants were experimentally clipped and burned. To assess the utility of a sprouting
    dichotomy, we used a mixture model approach (McLachlan and Basford 1988). Data
    were treated as arising from a small number of groups or populations, each of
    which had binomial distributions, with one probability of sprouting after clipping
    and another probability of sprouting after burning. The simplest model, a single
    group, assumed the species were the same and were samples from one population.
    The second model assumed that there were two groups. Expected numbers of plants
    sprouting were calculated for each species as if they were small samples from
    one of the two groups, given the number of species, the number of plants treated,
    the probability of belonging to a particular group and the associated probabilities
    of sprouting after the two treatments. Parameter estimates (probability of group
    membership and probabilities of sprouting after the two treatments) and associated
    deviances (D;_/2 log-likelihoods) were calculated with maximum likelihood methods
    (McCullagh and Nelder 1989) using the Solver plug-in for Microsoft Excel 2002
    (Microsoft, USA). Deviances were summed across species to give the model deviance.
    Three- and four-group models were constructed similarly to the twogroup model.
