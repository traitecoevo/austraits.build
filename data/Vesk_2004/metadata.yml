  description: trait data for species at Round Hill and Trangie from Peter Vesk
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: Nine sites were located within ca 5 km of each other in Round
    Hill-Nombinnie Nature Reserve (33 deg 21' S, 146 deg 01' E) and one site, 35 km
    to the east (33 deg 1'26' S, 146 deg 30'56' E), was in a 120 ha exclosure that
    was fenced in 1950 (Cunningham and Milthorpe 1981). Sites were selected to maximize
    the number of species sampled and species were not sampled at more than one site.
    Soil types covered a range of loamy red sands, light red clays and light red brown
    earths (Cohn 1995). Species We sampled common species of plants that had individuals
    less than 1.5 m tall, as these might be exposed to browsing by mammalian herbivores,
    primarily western grey kangaroos Macropus fuliginosus and feral goats Capra hircus.
    Ephemeral species were excluded. In all, 45 species were treated, representing
    10 grasses, 11 forbs, 7 sub-shrubs of the Chenopodiaceae and 17 woody shrubs and
    trees (Appendix 1). Nomenclature follows the Australian Plant Name Index online
    database (APNI) (Chapman 1991).

    description: The climate is warm and semi-arid. The closest meteorological station,
      Mt. Hope 30 km north-west, has median annual rainfall of 370 mm (220- 595, 1st
      to 9th deciles), and mean maximum daily temperatures ranging from 14.28C in
      July to 32.58C in February (Fig. 1). Monthly rainfall is relatively evenly distributed
      throughout the year, but is associated with patchy thunderstorms in summer and
      persistent but less intense fronts in winter. The area comprises low hills and
      foot-slopes, plains and dune fields, with dominant vegetation types open Callitris
      glaucophylla -Eucalyptus populnea woodland and Eucalyptus dumosa -E. socialis
      shrub mallee woodland (Cohn 1995). Wildfire in open woodland recurs every 5_/20
      years when years of above average rainfall allow sufficient grass (Stipa spp.
      ) fuel to build up (Walker et al. 1981, reviewed by Hobbs 2002). In these fires,
      mature trees may escape total leaf scorch, while shrubs and ground storey commonly
      experience total leaf scorch. Mallee woodland experiences fire with a similar
      mean frequency, though with less variable inter-fire periods as Triodia scariosa
      (porcupine grass) fuel breaks down more slowly than Stipa spp. in open woodland
      and so is retained over a number of years (Bradstock 1989, Noble 1989, Bradstock
      and Cohn 2002). In mallee fires, all growth forms commonly experience total
      leaf scorch, allowing for patchiness in intensity, in turn dependent upon the
      balance

traits:
- var_in: SLA
  unit_in: mm2/mg
  trait_name: specific_leaf_area
  value_type: site_mean
  replicates: '5'
  methods: Leaf size was optically scanned for at least two leaves from each of five
    individuals, and areas per leaf in mm2 were calculated using Delta-T Scan (Kirchhof
    & Pendar 1993). After drying for at least 24 h at c. 65 C, dry masses were measured
    and SLA calculated as area divided by dry mass (mm2 mg-1).
- var_in: leaf dry matter content (mg/g)
  unit_in: g/g
  trait_name: leaf_dry_matter_content
  value_type: site_mean
  replicates: '5'
  methods: At least two leaves were collected from each of five individuals. After
    collection, leaves were first allowed to rehydrate over night between layers of
    damp paper towel at 4 deg. C. then fresh masses were measured. Further all leaves
    were dried for 5 days at 65 degrees C before weighing dry. Leaf dry matter content
    was calculated as DM/FM.
- var_in: height (cm)
  unit_in: cm
  trait_name: plant_height
  value_type: site_max
  replicates: '30'
  methods: Height is the maximum of the 30 individuals in the experiment; or where
    individuals were restricted below 1.5 m for sampling, then heights were based
    on tall individuals in the vicinity.

  methods: See cited Oikos manuscript for detailed discussion of fire treatment methods. Plants were experimentally clipped and burned. To assess the utility of a sprouting dichotomy, we used a mixture model approach (McLachlan and Basford 1988). Data were treated as arising from a small number of groups or populations, each of which had binomial distributions, with one probability of sprouting after clipping and another probability of sprouting after burning. The simplest model, a single group, assumed the species were the same and were samples from one population. The second model assumed that there were two groups. Expected numbers of plants sprouting were calculated for each species as if they were small samples from one of the two groups, given the number of species, the number of plants treated, the probability of belonging to a particular group and the associated probabilities of sprouting after the two treatments. Parameter estimates (probability of group membership and probabilities of sprouting after the two treatments) and associated deviances (D;_/2 log-likelihoods) were calculated with maximum likelihood methods (McCullagh and Nelder 1989) using the Solver plug-in for Microsoft Excel 2002 (Microsoft, USA). Deviances were summed across species to give the model deviance. Three- and four-group models were constructed similarly to the twogroup model.
