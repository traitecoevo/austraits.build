  description: trait data for species at Round Hill and Trangie from Peter Vesk
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: Nine sites were located within ca 5 km of each other in Round
    Hill-Nombinnie Nature Reserve (33 째21' S, 146 째01' E) and one site, 35 km to the
    east (33 째1'26' S, 146 째30'56' E), was in a 120 ha exclosure that was fenced in
    1950 (Cunningham and Milthorpe 1981). Sites were selected to maximize the number
    of species sampled and species were not sampled at more than one site. Soil types
    covered a range of loamy red sands, light red clays and light red brown earths
    (Cohn 1995). Species We sampled common species of plants that had individuals
    less than 1.5 m tall, as these might be exposed to browsing by mammalian herbivores,
    primarily western grey kangaroos Macropus fuliginosus and feral goats Capra hircus.
    Ephemeral species were excluded. In all, 45 species were treated, representing
    10 grasses, 11 forbs, 7 sub-shrubs of the Chenopodiaceae and 17 woody shrubs and
    trees (Appendix 1). Nomenclature follows the Australian Plant Name Index online
    database (APNI) (Chapman 1991).

    description: The climate is warm and semi-arid. The closest meteorological station,
      Mt. Hope 30 km north-west, has median annual rainfall of 370 mm (220- 595, 1st
      to 9th deciles), and mean maximum daily temperatures ranging from 14.28C in
      July to 32.58C in February (Fig. 1). Monthly rainfall is relatively evenly distributed
      throughout the year, but is associated with patchy thunderstorms in summer and
      persistent but less intense fronts in winter. The area comprises low hills and
      foot-slopes, plains and dune fields, with dominant vegetation types open Callitris
      glaucophylla -Eucalyptus populnea woodland and Eucalyptus dumosa -E. socialis
      shrub mallee woodland (Cohn 1995). Wildfire in open woodland recurs every 5_/20
      years when years of above average rainfall allow sufficient grass (Stipa spp.
      ) fuel to build up (Walker et al. 1981, reviewed by Hobbs 2002). In these fires,
      mature trees may escape total leaf scorch, while shrubs and ground storey commonly
      experience total leaf scorch. Mallee woodland experiences fire with a similar
      mean frequency, though with less variable inter-fire periods as Triodia scariosa
      (porcupine grass) fuel breaks down more slowly than Stipa spp. in open woodland
      and so is retained over a number of years (Bradstock 1989, Noble 1989, Bradstock
      and Cohn 2002). In mallee fires, all growth forms commonly experience total
      leaf scorch, allowing for patchiness in intensity, in turn dependent upon the
      balance

questions:
  contributor: Do you have site location data for the three sites not included
    in the published manuscript? The coordinates for these sites were taken from online sources and you may have more precise coordinates for where your data were collected.
  methods: Do you have a brief description of the methods used to determine SLA and leaf dry matter content since these traits are not included in the published manuscript.
