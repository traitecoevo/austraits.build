  description: Study to test whether seedlings of small-seeded species were more reliant
    on soil nutrients than large-seeded ones by growing 10 species from three woody
    genera, Eucalyptus, Hakea and Banksia, along a gradient of nutrient availability;
    only seed nutrient content data included
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: Eight species from the genera Eucalyptus, Hakea and Banksia were
    selected from among those native to south-western Australia to represent a range
    of seed masses. However, two Banksia species were later excluded due to low seed
    viability and one Hakea species was excluded because it became infected by a fungus
    that caused almost complete mortality of seedlings the species included are shown
    in Table 1. All seeds used originated from wild populations. although some Hakea
    species were obtained through a commercial seed dealer, Nindethana Seed Service,
    Albany, Western Australia. Fruits of Eucalyptus and Hakea were air dried to release
    their seeds while fruits of Banksia had to be burnt to open their follicles.

traits:
- var_in: seed_mass_mg
  unit_in: mg
  trait_name: seed_dry_mass
  entity_type: population
  value_type: mean
  basis_of_value: measurement
  replicates: 10-100
  methods: Average seed mass was established by weighing 25 seeds individually, except
    for the small-seeded eucalypts for which mass was established by weighing several
    batches of 10 or 100 seeds.

  methods: Samples of milled seeds were analysed for N, P and K by an autoanalyser
    procedure after digestion with sulphuric acid and hydrogen peroxide (Varley 1966).
    Salicylic acid was added to prevent loss of nitrate-nitrogen.
