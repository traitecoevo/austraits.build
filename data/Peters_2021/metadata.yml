  description: By leveraging the climate breadth of the Australian landscape and a
    national network of research sites (Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Network), we
    conducted a continental-scale study of physiological and hydraulic traits of 33
    native tree species from contrasting environments to disentangle the complexities
    of plant response to drought across communities.

  sampling_strategy: 2.1 Study sites and species selection ^p All study sites are
    part of the Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Network (TERN) SuperSite platform (Karan
    et al., 2016). Seven SuperSites were selected based on climate and forest composition
    to achieve a wide coverage across both temperature and precipitation gradients.
    The SuperSites include Great Western Woodland (GWW), WA; Litchfield, NT; Alice
    Mulga, NT; Calperum, SA; Daintree Rainforest, QLD; Cumberland Plain, NSW; and
    Warra, TAS. Site location and climate information are listed in Table 1. Further
    site descriptions are available in the studies by Karan et al. (2016) and Bloomfield
    et al. (2018) and at www.tern.org.au/tern-observatory/tern-ecosystem-processes.
    All Supersites have a 1-ha vegetation plot used for regular tree inventories (https://supersites.tern.org.au/data).
    We used this inventory data to determine the canopy tree species that make up
    approximately 80% of the woody biomass at each site as our list of target species.
    Additional species were added where it was clear that the 1-ha vegetation plot
    did not represent the surrounding vegetation type as observed upon site visit,
    as was the case at the GWW, Cumberland Plain, Warra and Calperum. The Warra site
    is wet sclerophyll forest, dominated by Eucalyptus and Acacia; we also sampled
    an additional five rainforest tree species abundant in the subcanopy and upland
    area adjacent to the SuperSite. The official Calperum SuperSite was inundated
    by fire in 2014, therefore we sampled healthy trees approximately 2 km away. At
    the Daintree rainforest site, two species from the original target list were removed
    because abundant resin or mucilage prevented reliable hydraulic measurements and
    at the Alice Mulga site, we chose to only measure one species as the two mulga
    species; Acacia aptaneura and A. aneura are closely related and the latter was
    also present at the GWW site. We studied up to 10 species at each site for a total
    of 33, representing 19 unique genera; all study species were evergreen. Five of
    the sites have Eucalyptus species present, making it the most widespread genus
    in this study (see Table 2 for a complete species list). ^p All SuperSites are
    equipped with meteorological instrumentation and a flux tower for which data are
    publicly available from the TERN SuperSite data portal (https://supersites.tern.org.au/knb/).
    For each site, an aridity index was calculated as potential evapotranspiration
    divided by mean annual precipitation (AI = PET/MAP) using 40 years of interpolated
    climate data produced by TERN's eMAST, an ecosystem modelling and scaling infrastructure
    facility (Whitley et al., 2014; Yang et al., 2018). ^p 2.2 Site visits, tree selection
    and sampling ^p Sampling campaigns were targeted with two main objectives, first
    to measure water potentials that represented annual minimums (maximum water stress,
    psimin), and second to access stem material suitable for hydraulic vulnerability
    assessment—specifically xylem tissue that was fully developed but contained minimal
    native embolism. For most sites, this required two visits, once at the end of
    summer or dry season for minimum water potentials and once in the late growing
    season for stem material suitable for hydraulic measurements. Site weather patterns
    vary widely and exact site visits are listed in Table 1. ^p For each species,
    four to six individual trees were identified as measurement trees; selection criteria
    included accessibility, maturity and presence of sunlit branches. Branch and leaf
    samples were taken from the upper canopy as much as possible. Sampling was achieved
    using a canopy crane at the Daintree rainforest and Cumberland Plain EucFACE site,
    pole pruners, a 'Big Shot' and rope or cherry picker at all other sites. A qualified
    shooter used a rifle at Warra to sever upper canopy (60 m) branches of the Eucalyptus
    and Acacia species.

  methods: Two predawn water potential leaves were collected from each measurement
    tree in the early morning before sunrise. Water potentials were measured in the
    field using a Scholander pressure chamber (Model 1505D, PMS Instruments Co.) as
    described in Scholander et al. (1965). All water potentials were measured on clear
    sunny days at multiple times throughout each visit and the lowest observed values
    are reported here as seasonal minimum water potentials, psimin, and corresponding
    predawn, psipd, and midday leaf, psiLeaf. Water potentials were previously measured
    and reported from the Alice Mulga NT site (Nolan et al., 2017, 2018; O'Grady et
    al., 2009). In our analysis, we used dry season minimums reported in Nolan et
    al. (2017) for Acacia aptaneura. Uncovered leaf water potential was used as psimin
    as stomata were closed at these water potentials and leaf and stem were assumed
    in equilibrium under these conditions (Choat et al., 2012).

  methods: For midday measurements, two leaves on each tree were covered with plastic
    wrap and aluminium foil to stop photosynthesis and transpiration for at least
    30 min before collection (Brodribb et al., 2003; McCutchan & Shackel, 1992). Then
    the two covered leaves and two uncovered leaves were collected for stem and leaf
    water potentials respectively. At sites without canopy access via canopy crane
    or cherry picker, sunlit trees with low branches, particularly along access roads,
    were selected and sampled using a ladder. Leaves were excised, stored in airtight
    bags in a cool dark insulated box until measurement (maximum 1 h). Water potentials
    were measured in the field using a Scholander pressure chamber (Model 1505D, PMS
    Instruments Co.) as described in Scholander et al. (1965). All water potentials
    were measured on clear sunny days at multiple times throughout each visit and
    the lowest observed values are reported here as seasonal minimum water potentials,
    psimin, and corresponding predawn, psipd, and midday leaf, psiLeaf. Water potentials
    were previously measured and reported from the Alice Mulga NT site (Nolan et al.,
    2017, 2018; O'Grady et al., 2009). In our analysis, we used dry season minimums
    reported in Nolan et al. (2017) for Acacia aptaneura. Uncovered leaf water potential
    was used as psimin as stomata were closed at these water potentials and leaf and
    stem were assumed in equilibrium under these conditions (Choat et al., 2012).

  methods: Leaves from three to five individual trees were used for pressure-volume curve measurements for each species. Small branches (30 to 50 cm long) were collected between first light and sunrise, kept moist in a plastic bag and transported to the laboratory. Cut stems were recut under water and the small branches were allowed to rehydrate for 2-24 h. Pressure-volume curves were constructed for one leaf from each measurement tree. Leaves were removed from rehydrating small branches. Water potential was immediately measured using a pressure chamber, and leaf fresh weight was measured on a high-precision analytical balance. Paired water potential and leaf fresh weight measurements were taken in quick succession as leaves began to dry to describe the initial drop in water potential. Paired measurements were taken repeatedly at decreasing frequency over the course of dehydration. Inverted water potential (1/psi) was plotted against the leaf relative water content, and the turgor loss point (psiTLP) was estimated as the water potential at the point when the curve becomes linear (Tyree & Hammel, 1972). We also included previously reported psiTLP values from Dysoxylum, Elaeocarpus and Syzygium sayeri (Nolf et al., 2015) and Acacia aptaneura (Nolan et al., 2017).

  methods: A single branch per measurement tree was collected in the early morning (between first light and no more than 1 h after sunrise) from each of the four to six measurement trees. Sampling occurred in the early morning to minimize xylem tension at collection and thus minimize cutting artefacts. Branches were between 0.7 and 5 cm diameter at cut end and at least 30% longer than maximum vessel length (0.5 m to 2.5 m depending on species). Branches were placed in large plastic bags with moist towels to prevent dehydration and cut ends were immediately recut under water to allow the relaxation of xylem tension in the field. Branches were transported to the laboratory either still in water or with wet towels and plastic on cut end (maximum transport time was 1 h). Branches were stored in a cool, dark area with cut end in water for 6-24 h before measurements began. ^p 2.4.1 Benchtop dehydration ^p Most stem percent loss in conductivity (PLC) curves was measured using the benchtop dehydration method (Sperry & Tyree, 1988). Branches were allowed to equilibrate in a plastic bag for 1 h before measurement. Two covered leaves (wrapped in plastic wrap and foil) were measured for water potential and then an initial cut was made under water in the distal end of the branch, approximately 30 cm from the target measurement segment. Xylem tension was relaxed for 10 minutes under water to avoid the cutting artefact (Wheeler et al., 2013) before excision of side branch from main branch under water. The excised side branch was then slowly trimmed under water from both ends to a segment of measurement size (between 5 and 10 cm). The measurement segment was attached to tubing, and hydraulic conductivity was measured using a flowmeter (Liqui-Flow L10, Bronkhorst High-Tech BV, Ruurlo) at low pressure (<4 kPa; Bourne et al., 2017). The segment was then flushed with degassed, filtered (0.22 µm) 2 mmol KCl at high pressure (0.1-0.2 MPa) for 20 min to remove gas emboli, after which maximum conductivity measurements were taken. Four to six measurement segments were used from each large branch at progressively lower water potentials over several days. (See manuscript for equation.) ^p 2.4.2 Cavitron ^p Short-vesselled species (maximum vessel length <20 cm) from Tasmania (Eucryphia, Nothofagus, Atherosperma, Pomaderris and Phyllocladus) and Hakea sericea from the Cumberland Plain's woodland NSW were measured using the cavitron method (Cochard, 2002) using a modified bench top centrifuge (H2100R, Cence Xiangyi). Stem segments, 28 cm in length, were cut from well-hydrated branches under water. Samples were not flushed prior to measurement to avoid the introduction of air or particles. They were fitted into the rotor and initial measurement logged at low spin (equivalent to 0.35 MPa pressure) were used for maximum conductivity measurments. Samples were then stepped though increasing pressures at 0.3 to 1 MPa steps depending on the species to complete a curve with at least 8 points. Three to five branches were used per species. ^p 2.4.3 Static centrifuge ^p Callitris verrucosa from Calperum SA was measured using a static centrifuge method to induce xylem tension, and hydraulic conductivity was measured using the flowmeter (Alder et al., 1997). Stem segments, 28 cm in length, were cut from well-hydrated branches under water. Initial, unflushed measurements were taken for maximum conductivity using a flowmeter as described above. The sample was then fitted into rotor and pressures of 1 MPa, 3 MPa then 1 MPa steps to 14 MPa were induced using the centrifuge in ascending order. Samples were removed and flow measurements taken after a 2-min spin at each pressure.

  methods: Hydraulic vulnerability curves were constructed by measuring hydraulic
    conductivity at progressively more negative xylem pressures. Maximum vessel length
    was measured first, using the air-injection method (Cohen et al., 2003), for all
    species to determine the appropriate technique for measuring hydraulic vulnerability
    (measurement method is available in Table 2). A single branch per measurement
    tree was collected in the early morning (between first light and no more than
    1 h after sunrise) from each of the four to six measurement trees. Sampling occurred
    in the early morning to minimize xylem tension at collection and thus minimize
    cutting artefacts. Branches were between 0.7 and 5 cm diameter at cut end and

    and cut ends were immediately recut under water to allow the relaxation of xylem
    tension in the field. Branches were transported to the laboratory either still
    in water or with wet towels and plastic on cut end (maximum transport time was
    1 h). Branches were stored in a cool, dark area with cut end in water for 6-24
    h before measurements began.
