  sampling_strategy: A curated collection of plant growth form values that includes all species in the Australian Plant Census (APC). The basis for this dataset are the data from the online Flora of Australia, state herbarium floras (VicFlora, PlantNet (NSW), South Australia eFlora, Florabase (WA), and NT eFlora), and the Lucid Key compilation for Australian Tropical Rainforest Plants. Data from these sources was extracted programatically, combined, and extensively checked. These datasets are individually incorporated into AusTraits as well. For this curated dataset, taxa not present in one of the floras or without a specified plant growth form or woodiness were looked up in a series of resources, including the print Flora of Australia books and the original taxon descriptions for many species. The sources are documented in the data.csv file. Excluding taxa that are undescribed but assigned an accepted phrase name, there are fewer than 100 taxa for which plant growth form and woodiness has not been scored.
