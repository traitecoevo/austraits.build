  description: A study comparing relative bark thickness, as an index of fire resistance,
    of dominant canopy species between Australia and New Zealand cool temperate rain
    forests, to evaluate why New Zealand forests were more susceptible to repeated
    anthropogenic fires than Australian forests.
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: Bark thickness was sampled from dominant rain forest species
    at 17 sites in New Zealand, two sites in Tasmania and four sites in New South
    Wales, Australia (see Appendix S1 in Supporting Information). Sites were representative
    of core temperate rain forests, with typical species combinations. Bark thickness
    is the net outcome of allocation processes, referred to here as 'bark allocation'
    (Jackson et al., 1999). Differences in the bark allocation strategies of woody
    plants are most likely to manifest at smaller stem sizes in fire-prone ecosystems
    (Jackson et al., 1999; Lawes et al., 2013). The bark thickness to stem size relationship
    (bark ratio; sensu Hoffmann et al., 2009) is linear at these small stems sizes,
    which assists in ensuring robust comparison of bark thickness among sites and
    species. Accordingly, we measured bark thickness at each site from at least 10
    individuals per species spanning 1-20 cm diameter at breast height (d.b.h.). Individuals
    were chosen at random along tracks or transects through forest. We took three
    measures of bark thickness at breast height (1.3 m) per individual and used the
    mean of these three measures in analyses.

  methods: Bark thickness was measured using a standard thickness gauge (Hagl√∂f, Barktax,
    Sweden) or where bark was not penetrable using the gauge, we used a needle punch
    (diameter = 3 mm). In both cases the gauge was inserted to the point of resistance
    by the sapwood. Bark thickness measured by this method includes the cambium in
    most instances. Where bark was fissured we measured thickness from the highest
    point. We took three measures of bark thickness at breast height (1.3 m) per individual
    and used the mean of these three measures in analyses. For all subsequent analyses,
    bark thickness was relativized among species by expressing bark thickness (cm)
    as a percentage (%) of stem diameter (cm) (Lawes et al., 2013) to provide a single
    size-adjusted measure of bark investment (relative bark thickness, RBT).
