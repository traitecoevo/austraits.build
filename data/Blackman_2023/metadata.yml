  description: A theoretical trade-off between the efficiency and safety of water transport systems in plants is used to explain diverse ecological patterns, from tree size to community structure. 
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: We focused our analysis on a group of 21 eucalypt species (family Myrtaceae) representing three genera (19 Eucalyptus, 1 Angophora and 1 Corymbia) from a wide range of habitats across eastern Australia (Supporting Information Table S1). Across all species sampling sites, mean annual temperature varies widely, ranging from ca. 6°C for species from sub-alpine woodland in Tasmania, where trees are subject to freezing temperatures in the winter months, through to ca. 21°C for Corymbia citriodora from open woodland in North Queensland (Supporting Information Table S1). Mean annual precipitation also varies widely across species sampling sites, ranging from 383 mm for Eucalyptus socialis from semi-arid New South Wales through to ca. 1500 mm for species from high rainfall sites in western Tasmania (Supporting Information Table S1). Field sampling was undertaken from trees within the natural distribution of each species during the cooler austral months from April to September, when hydraulic stress is typically minimal. All sampled trees displayed adult foliage, with distinct petioles. For each species, we sampled a single sun-exposed canopy branch greater than 1 m in length from four to five mature trees co-occurring within a single population. Cut branches were immediately placed and sealed inside 2x large plastic bags, humidified with damp paper towel and transported back to the laboratory. From these branches, all leaf (including the petiole) and stem hydraulic, morphological and anatomical measurements were taken.

  methods: Leaf hydraulic vulnerability was assessed for the Tasmanian species using the optical vulnerability (OV) method (Brodribb et al., 2016). In brief, branches were placed on the laboratory bench with plastic bags laid over exposed leaves to slow rates of water loss and allowed to dehydrate over the course of 2-3 days. The occurrence of xylem embolism formation in leaf veins was recorded using a 'cavicam' (Cavicam.co), attached to a single mature leaf of each branch, with images taken every 5 min. Changes in xylem water potential were recorded using an ICT psychrometer (ICT PSY) mounted midway along the main stem. Water potentials were also regularly measured using a Scholander pressure bomb to validate the psychrometer readings. Branches were dehydrated until leaves became dry and crispy to touch. ^p Image analysis of the OV images was performed via an image subtraction procedure in ImageJ. Following the removal of any 'noise' associated with leaf shrinkage during dehydration, changes in pixel brightness intensity were attributed to embolism formation (see http://www.opensourceov.org/ for details). Embolised pixels were then expressed as a percentage of the total embolised area recorded at the end of the dehydration experiment and plotted against predicted xylem water potential. Leaf hydraulic vulnerability was expressed as the water potential associated with the accumulation of 50% of the total embolised area (psi50leaf, MPa). psi50leaf was determined for each of the four to five branches sampled per species and then averaged to give a species mean (±SE). These Tasmanian species' psi50leaf values are also recorded in a related study (Hartill et al., 2023). (For the five species from mainland Australia, Ψ50leaf values were drawn from previous measurements of leaf hydraulic vulnerability (Blackman et al., 2014) generated using the direct flow rehydration technique (Brodribb & Cochard, 2009). This hydraulic technique measures the rehydration dynamics of the xylem in dehydrated leaves and/or small shoots and has been shown to give comparable results for Ψ50leaf as the OV technique (Brodribb et al., 2016). [These data are not yet in AusTraits and have been retained, although some Blackman_2014 data is in Westoby_2014.]

  methods: Using the same branches sampled for hydraulic vulnerability, we measured a range of xylem anatomical traits of the petiole of a single intact (i.e., with no signs of leaf damage) mature leaf excised from the most recent growth cohort of each branch (n = 4-5). A small length of petiole from each leaf was cut mid-way along its length and mounted to the stage of a freeze-microtome in corn syrup solution, with the sample positioned upright and perpendicular to the cutting blade. The remaining leaf was scanned with a flatbed scanner for determination of LA. A cutting blade was passed across the petiole cutting sections 10-20 um in thickness. Cut sections were isolated and stained in a dilute solution of toluidine blue before being rinsed in water and mounted on a slide in glycerol jelly. Suitable sections were imaged at 2x and 10x magnification using a camera mounted to a light microscope (Nikon Eclipse 50i). Petiole xylem anatomical properties were measured from these images using ImageJ.^p XLApetiole (cm2 m-2) was calculated for each leaf as the total XA in cross-section dived by projected LA (see Figure 1). We note that the petiole xylem of these eucalypts contains thin parenchyma rays but were not considered separately on the basis they constituted less than <1% of the total xylem cross-sectional area. Nor did we measure fibres outside of the defined XA. However, for non-eucalypt species with more complex anatomy, additional features such as a high proportion of parenchyma, multiple vascular bundles, and/or fibrous bundle caps, may need to be considered in the analysis of XLApetiole. For each cross-section, we calculated the hydraulically weighted diameter (Dh, um) of all vessels (i.e., vessel lumens) with an area greater than 10 um2; see manuscript for equation.

Stem samples ~1 cm in diameter were excised and the bark removed before being suspended in a beaker of water placed on a high precision balance and the change in mass, as a proxy for volume, recorded.

questions:
  question1: Is it OK to map Kspetiole to the standard `sapwood_specific_hydraulic_conductivity` or should I create a separate trait for Ks_petiole? The values are at the low end of other studies, but not outliers.
  question2: I currently have the vessel diameter mapped to `leaf_vessel_diameter` so that the values can be compared to other leaf vessel diameters. However, I will map this to a new trait `leaf_vessel_diameter_hydraulic`.
  question3: Blackman_2014 is part of the AusTraits dataset Westoby_2014. Oddly we don't have any
