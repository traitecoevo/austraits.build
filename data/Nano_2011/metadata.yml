  description: Study examining how resprouting and propagule persistence are associated
    with grassland and shrubland habitats and whether landscape gradients of aridity,
    fire frequency or resource competition underpin spatial variability in community
    composition.

  sampling_strategy: Site selection ^p We selected 385 sites from a database of Northern
    Territory quadrat-based vegetation surveys (NT government unpublished data). All
    of the included sites had floristic and environmental data that had been recorded
    in situ by multiple recorders (including the authors) during field surveys using
    standardised survey protocols. Sites were selected to sample across habitat type
    (grassland versus shrubland/woodland), bioregions, landform setting and the rainfall
    gradient. We included 185 Triodia hummock grassland sites and 185 shrubland/woodland
    sites that were dominated by slow-growing and long-lived Acacia tall shrubs or
    trees that have a widespread distribution throughout the study region. Additionally,
    we included 15 dune crest sites that were characterised by medium-stature shrubs
    and sparse ground cover. The dune crest sites were included in the analysis to
    test for the influence of fine-scale fire refugia in hummock grassland dune fields
    given that grass fuel loads are usually low on crests relative to those on adjacent
    dune slopes. The sites were from seven southern NT bioregions that are characterised
    by these habitat types and that are periodically burned by wildfire (Fig. 1).
    Most of the included sites (42%) were from the MacDonnell Ranges Bioregion, reflecting
    an existing sampling bias that could not be avoided in this study. All available
    data for sites not associated with the MacDonnell Ranges were used. The selection
    of sites from the MacDonnell Ranges data set (c. 70% of relevant sites) aimed
    to reflect habitat variability and the spatial extent of that system. For both
    grassland and shrubland/woodland habitat, 22% of sites were from areas with a
    yearly average rainfall of <250 mm and the remaining were from areas with between
    250 and 450 mm. Sites were evenly distributed between course-scale runoff (mountain
    range) and runon (plain/floodplain/dune field) settings. Sites were included only
    if they had >10% cover of the structural dominant (excluding the crest sites)
    and they had not been burned within 5 years of the survey. If a site had >10%
    cover of any of the focal Acacia shrubland/woodland dominants, it was allocated
    to the shrubland/woodland class, independent of the cover of Triodia in the understorey.
    Of the grassland sites, 96 were dominated by resprouting Triodia species and 89
    by non-resprouting Triodia species. We excluded Triodia grassland sites on chemically/texturally
    extreme soils (sensu Nano and Clarke 2008) that are unlikely to support shrubland
    regardless of fire effects. For shrubland/woodland habitat, we included 140 sites
    dominated by fire-killed species (Acacia aneura, A. macdonelliensis and A. ammobia)
    and 50 dominated by resprouting species (A. kempeana and A. estrophiolata). Site
    allocation approximately reflected the availability of habitat samples and their
    relative abundance in the landscape (Fig. 1). ^p Persistence traits ^p Persistence
    trait data were collated for all of the woody species that were recorded from
    the 385 sites. Population-level data were derived from published (e.g. Crowley
    et al. 2007) and unpublished databases (e.g. NT Ecological Attributes Database,
    Northern Territory Government), the scientific literature and our own field records.

    precipitation, MAP (mm): 175 to 482
    climate description: Rainfall variability decreases from north to south. Overall,
      rainfall is low and unpredictable, with extended drought periods being occasionally
      interrupted by rare and prolonged above average rainfall events. There is a
      slight summer rainfall bias, this being most pronounced in the north, which
      is more strongly influenced by monsoonal activity across northern Australia.
      Temperature maxima decline slightly from north to south. Conversely, the frequency
      of potential frost days (days with sub-zero temperatures) decreases from south
      to north (Bureau of Meteorology 2011).

  methods: Persistence traits ^p Persistence trait data were collated for all of the

    derived from published (e.g. Crowley et al. 2007) and unpublished databases (e.g.
    NT Ecological Attributes Database, Northern Territory Government), the scientific
    literature and our own field records. We compiled all records relating to vegetative
    fire response to enable us to categorise species either as a resprouter (R+) or
    as a non-resprouter (R-), following the approach of Pausas and Bradstock (2007).
    This categorisation was thus based on each species’ overall tendency across multiple
    populations. We classified a species as R+ if it met any of the following criteria
    - (1) all of its response records were R+; (2) most records were R+ and the remaining
    were variable within population (V); (3) all records were V; or (4) there were
    equal proportions of R+, V, and R- records. This binary classification necessarily
    masks resprouting variability within species and among populations. However, it
    is effective in distinguishing those species that usually have some capacity to
    resprout, and can maintain at least part of the standing plant population after
    fire, from those with very little or no resprouting capacity.

    all available records (from the same sources outlined above) relating to propagule
    persistence (P+, following Pausas and Bradstock 2007). Following Pausas et al.
    (2004), we used three explicit criteria for propagule persistence - the species
    needed to have a seed bank that (1) is long-lived, (2) is stimulated to germinate
    by fire and (3) can be established within the fire cycle—in this case within 10
    years, which is the spatially averaged return interval for the region (Allan and
    Southgate 2002). Criteria i and ii were determined mainly from the seed biology
    literature that provided experimental results relating to seed bank dynamics,
    seed storage behaviour, physical dormancy and positive germination heat responses.
    Criterion ii was also determined from field observation records (extracted from
    the NT Ecological Attributes Database) of post-fire responses. Criterion iii had
    the inbuilt factor of time-to-maturation. In this region, species such as Acacia
    aneura face an immaturity risk in Triodia grassland because their primary juvenile
    period far exceeds average fire-return intervals in that habitat (Nano and Clarke
    2010).
