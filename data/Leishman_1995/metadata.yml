  description: trait data for Sydney sites from Michelle Leishman
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: The conditions for plant growth and seedling establishment differ
    markedly among the five floras. In the arid and semiarid floras of Central Australia
    and western New South Wales, opportunities for growth and seedling establishment
    may be limited by low soil moisture conditions in both cool and warm seasons,
    and they may remain limited for periods of time varying from several months to
    several years. In the Sydney flora, plant growth can occur at all times of the
    year, although it may be slower in the cooler months. Much seedling establishment
    occurs postfire.The overlap of species between the floras was very low. Only western
    New South Wales and Central Australia had a substantial number of species in common
    (86 species). Each of these datasets have been published previously in separate
    studies (Table 1). However, some information was added for this analysis. For
    Central Australia, information on plant height from Jessop (1981) was added
    and diaspore mass was replaced with seed mass. For Sydney, more detailed information
    on plant height, growth form and perenniality was added, from Beadle et al. (1982)
    and Fairlie & Moore (1989).

sites: The floras of western New South Wales and Central Australia are typical semiarid/arid
  communities, consisting of a perennial grass understorey with a mix of annual and
  perennial forbs, and an overstorey of scattered shrubs and trees. The western New
  South Wales flora included communities of three soil types (see Leishman & Westoby
  (1992) for further detail), while the Central Australian flora included a number
  of habitats such as Acacia woodland, open woodland and floodplain. The Sydney flora
  consisted of two distinct communities, those of fertile soils (wet sclerophyll forest
  to rainforest) and those of infertile soils (dry sclerophyll forest and shrubland).

  methods: Values are published maximum heights from published Floras. Plant height divided into the following categories, < 0.10 m, 0.11-0.50 m, 0.51-1.0 m, 1.1-5.0 m, 5.1-10 m, > 10 m. analysis. For Central Australia, infor- mation on plant height from Jessop (1981) was added and diaspore mass was replaced with seed mass. For Sydney, more detailed information on plant height, growth form and perenniality was added, from Beadle et al. (1982) and Fairlie & Moore (1989). 
- var_in: Leaf Size (mm2)
  unit_in: mm2
  trait_name: leaf_area
  value_type: site_mean
  replicates: 5
  methods: Leaf area is a mean value form measured herbarium or field specimens. Leaf Area measured using leaf area meter. Minimum of 5 replicates.
- var_in: Seed mass (mg)
  unit_in: mg
  trait_name: seed_mass
  value_type: multisite_mean
  replicates: 10
  methods: Seed mass was defined as the weight of the embryo and endosperm, plus the
    seed coat. Structures having the function of contributing to dispersal were not
    included as part of the seed mass. Seed mass was log-transformed for the analyses
    as seed mass is log-normally distributed (Westoby et al. 1992). See also Westoby et al. 1990. At least 10 replicates per species
- var_in: GrowthForm 1=tree; 2=shrub; 3=subshrub; 4=forb; 5=grass; 8=fern; 10=climber;
    11=orchid, epiphyte.
  unit_in: .na
  trait_name: plant_growth_form
  value_type: expert_mean
  replicates: .na
  methods: Species with secondary thickening were assigned to the growth form category
    'woody plants'. Herbaceous species without secondary thickening were defined as
    'forbs'. Grasses, rushes and sedges (i.e. species belonging to the families Cyperaceae,
    Juncaceae, Poaceae, Restionaceae, Sparganiaceae and Typhaceae) were classed as
    'graminoids'. Climbers, twiners and vines were defined as 'climbers'. We assigned
    climbing species that had no information available on height of release of the
    seeds to height class 4 (1.1-5.0 m). Species from the arid and semiarid floras
    that are facultative perennials (able to persist for more than one year under
    particularly good conditions) were considered as annuals because at most germination
    opportunities they are present as a seed bank only.
- var_in: Seed Dispersal syndrome 1=unassisted; 2=ant (elaiosome); 3=vertebrate ingestion
    (fleshy); 4=adhesion (hooks etc); 5=wind (wing, pappus); 6=ballistic+ant; 7=ba
    llistic; 8=vertebrate.
  unit_in: .na
  trait_name: dispersal_syndrome
  value_type: expert_mean
  replicates: .na
  methods: Divided into the following classes, unassisted, ant-adapted, vertebrate-adapted,
    adhesion-adapted, wind-adapted and scatterhoarded. Dispersal modes were attributed
    to species on the basis of the morphological features of the seed. Ant-adapted
    seeds were defined as those with an elaiosome, vertebrate-adapted seeds were defined
    as having an aril or flesh. Adhesion-adapted seeds had hooks, spines or barbs
    to assist attachment, while wind-adapted had wings, hairs or a pappus to provide
    air-resistance. Unassisted seeds were defined as having no obvious morphological
    structure which would assist dispersal. Seeds which float, or are dispersed in
    mud or by ingestion with foliage (see Janzen 1984) are thus classified as unassisted.
    The exception to this was the category of scatterhoarded. In the two northern
    hemisphere floras there were 12 species whose seeds are known to be scatterhoarded
    by mammals. Although these species have no morphological structures which can
    be used to define 'scatterhoarding', we felt that their natural history was sufficiently
    well-known to justify the use of this dispersal category. The Sydney and Sheffield
    databases contained a few species that had ballistic dispersal. Ballistic dispersal
    is difficult to determine when herbarium seed material has been used, as the ballistic
    mechanism is part of the parent plant. Thus ballistically dispersed seeds were
    classified as unassisted in order to standardize the databases. Some ballistically
    dispersed seeds also have an elaiosome for dispersal by ants. These species were
    classified as ant-adapted only, for the purpose of this analysis.
