  description: leaf P and N mass and other traits for 21 species from Wilson Promontery.
    By, using an index of sclerophylly derived from botanists rankings (botanists
    sclerophylly index, BSI) we determined that leaves considered by botanists to
    be sclerophyllous generally had both high strength and work to fracture (particularly
    in punching and tearing tests), both at the level of leaf and per unit leaf thickness.
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: The plants were sampled over a distance of c. 500 m. Nineteen
    species (_Table 1) were selected as described by EDWARDS et al. (2000). Leaves
    varied in texture from "soft" to "hard". Five plants per species were selected
    haphazardly, the only criterion being that they had sunlit branches for reasons
    of consistency. Leaves that expanded during the previous growing season were collected
    from sunlit branches. The acacia foliage comprises phyllodes but these are referred
    to as leaves for simplicity.

    description: Leaves were collected in November 1995 from Lilly Pilly Gully at
      Wilson's Promontory National Park in the far south-eastern Australian mainland
      (39 deg 1'S, 146 deg 0'E). The climate is relatively mild with few extremes
      of temperature and with an annual rainfall of c. 1000 mm (ASHTON & WEBB, 1977).
      The rainfall is higher and more uniformly distributed through the year than
      much of the southern mainland, allowing close proximity of rainforest, eucalypt-dominated
      forest and heath. However, none of the species investigated is endemic to this
      area, most also occurring in areas with a more pronounced winter-high rainfall
      regime.The plants were sampled over a distance of c. 500 m. The vegetation graded
      from Open forest dominated by Eucalyptus obliqua with a shrub and tree understorey
      including rainforest species, through an intermediate forest dominated by E.
      obliqua and E. baxteri, to a 1-2 m heath with occasional stunted E. baxteri.
      Banksia marginata was collected in both the forest understorey and the heath
      but in this study only the heath collection is reported. All plants occurred
      on sandy soils. The heath was recorded on highly-leached siliceous beach sands
      and the forest on sands derived from granite, the latter commonly with more
      clay and organic matter (PARSONS, 1966) and in this study with higher levels
      of phosphorus and exchangeable cations (Table 2).

    Hand sections were cut from a fresh leaf of each of the five replicate plants
    per species. A c. 5 x 5 mm square of leaf was cut from the right hand side of
    each leaf, halfway between leaf tip and leaf base, and halfway between the midrib
    and margin. Multiple transverse sections were cut, examined at x400 under a light
    microscope and recorded on video for later anatomical measurements. The videotaped
    sections were displayed on a 68.5 cm (27") television screen for measurement of
    thickness of each of the following: whole leaf; upper and lower cuticle, upper
    and lower epidermis, hypodermis (3 species), fibre cell layer (1" species), palisade
    layer and spongy mesophyll layer. Three measurements of each characteristic were
    made, each on separate leaf sections and these sub-replicates were averaged.'
