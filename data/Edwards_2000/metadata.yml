  description: leaf P and N mass and other traits for 21 species from Wilson Promontery.
    By, using an index of sclerophylly derived from botanists rankings (botanists
    sclerophylly index, BSI) we determined that leaves considered by botanists to
    be sclerophyllous generally had both high strength and work to fracture (particularly
    in punching and tearing tests), both at the level of leaf and per unit leaf thickness.
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: The plants were sampled over a distance of c. 500 m. Nineteen
    species (_Table 1) were selected as described by EDWARDS et al. (2000). Leaves
    varied in texture from "soft" to "hard". Five plants per species were selected
    haphazardly, the only criterion being that they had sunlit branches for reasons
    of consistency. Leaves that expanded during the previous growing season were collected
    from sunlit branches. The acacia foliage comprises phyllodes but these are referred
    to as leaves for simplicity.
  original_file: Read_WilsonsProm.xls
  notes: Punch test values for Goodenia ovata and Bedfordia salicina have been removed,
    as the authors had difficulty measuring values for the thinnest, softest leaves
    at that time and believe these values should be used in broader comparative studies.
    The values are in the data.csv file but have been excluded from AusTraits.

    description: Leaves were collected in November 1995 from Lilly Pilly Gully at
      Wilson's Promontory National Park in the far south-eastern Australian mainland
      (39 deg 1'S, 146 deg 0'E). The climate is relatively mild with few extremes
      of temperature and with an annual rainfall of c. 1000 mm (ASHTON & WEBB, 1977).
      The rainfall is higher and more uniformly distributed through the year than
      much of the southern mainland, allowing close proximity of rainforest, eucalypt-dominated
      forest and heath. However, none of the species investigated is endemic to this
      area, most also occurring in areas with a more pronounced winter-high rainfall
      regime.The plants were sampled over a distance of c. 500 m. The vegetation graded
      from Open forest dominated by Eucalyptus obliqua with a shrub and tree understorey
      including rainforest species, through an intermediate forest dominated by E.
      obliqua and E. baxteri, to a 1-2 m heath with occasional stunted E. baxteri.
      Banksia marginata was collected in both the forest understorey and the heath
      but in this study only the heath collection is reported. All plants occurred
      on sandy soils. The heath was recorded on highly-leached siliceous beach sands
      and the forest on sands derived from granite, the latter commonly with more
      clay and organic matter (PARSONS, 1966) and in this study with higher levels
      of phosphorus and exchangeable cations (Table 2).

  methods: Tests were undertaken within 48 h of collection on one of three haphazardly
    chosen leaves from each replicate plant of each species, including the two separate
    collections of B. marginata. A Universal Testing Machine (Chatillon Universal
    Tension and Compression Tester, model UTSE-2) was modified to produce a data output
    of 800 points per second to a personal computer. Punching, tearing and shearing
    tests were undertaken and the mechanical properties (Table 2) derived from force-displacement
    curves using software written by M. Logan (Monash University). Toughness was measured
    as the area under the force-displacement curve until complete fracture, which
    we term work to fracture.  Some aspects of these tests have been evaluated more
    recently by Aranwela et al. (1999). PUNCH TEST This test involves punching a hole
    through the leaf lamina. It has been commonly described as a test of compression
    properties, though Vincent (1992) suggested the resistance to penetration is a
    combination of shear and compressive strength and resistance to crack propagation.
    A die was mounted onto the moving head of the test machine so that it engaged
    a steel, flat-ended, sharp-edged cylindrical punch with 1.13 mm2 area and a clearance
    of 0.068 mm. The displacement speed was set at 0.5 mm s-1. Ideally, the mechanical
    properties of both the tissue between the main veins (midrib and 2deg veins) and
    the vascular tissue should be investigated. However, time was a major constraint
    since leaves had to be tested as soon as possible after collection. Therefore,
    we standardised the punch position to the left-hand side of the leaves mid- way
    between leaf tip and base, between the midrib and the leaf margin, avoiding main
    veins where possible. A blank run was per- formed every 10-20 runs to measure
    background friction and was subtracted from the leaf force-displacement curves.
    Lamina thickness was measured in video-projected microscope images of fresh sections
    (the mean of three measures). Leaf strength and tough- ness were derived from
    the force-displacement curve (Fig. 1; Table 2).

    recently by Aranwela et al. (1999). TEARING TEST A longitudinal strip of lamina
    32-40 mm long and 4-5 mm wide was cut from the middle of the left-hand side of
    each leaf, where large enough, such that the length was more than 8 times the
    width to counter the effects of necking (Vincent 1990; Lucas et al. 1991). Test
    strips were clamped in the force-tester using pneumatic clamps set at 350 kPa.
    The clamped ends of the test strips were wrapped in damp absorbent tissue to reduce
    cell collapse that might lead to low force readings due to the lamina breaking
    at this point. The strips were inspected following the test to determine if slippage
    had occurred. Where it was detected the test was repeated on a fresh strip. The
    strips were notched on the left-hand side up to a known length of 2 mm, maintaining
    a constant ratio of notch to test strip width as far as possible. The notch directs
    the position of fracture so the test strip does not break at the clamps. However,
    this might cause a stress concentration at the notch, possibly leading to inaccurate
    estimation of fracture properties in notch-sensitive materials. To test for notch-sensitivity,
    tensile strength can be plotted against the relative length of the notch (expressed
    as a fraction of the strip width). A notch-insensitive material is indicated by
    a straight line (Vincent 1990; Lucas et al. 1991). However, we had insufficient
    time between collection and the time when it was considered testing should be
    completed to test notch sensitivity. In addition, the small leaves of many species
    prevented a sufficiently wide range of notch lengths being accurately applied
    to allow testing of notch sensitivity. There was no solution to this problem.
    Any effect was minimised by standardising the relative notch length as far as
    possible. It was impossible to obtain the recommended aspect ratio from lamina
    tissue alone in the small- and narrow-leaved species (Acacia suaveolens, Banksia
    spp., Platylobium obtusangulum, Hibbertia aspera, Leptospermum laevigatum and
    Monotoca scoparia) and therefore the test strips of these species included the
    midrib and leaf margins. In Melaleuca squarrosa we could not maintain the aspect
    ratio and whole leaves were used. The fracture length of the leaf was measured
    using callipers and lamina thickness was measured as for the punch test to estimate
    the cross-sectional area of the fractured leaf, corrected for the area of the
    initial notch. The head speed was set at 0.5 mm s-1. Figure 2 illustrates a typical
    tearing force-displacement plot from which the tensile strength and toughness
    were derived (Table 2). The initial linear section of the slope could not be consistently
    detected. Therefore, measurement of stiffness was abandoned.

    this might cause a stress concentration at the notch, possibly leading to inaccurate
    estimation of fracture properties in notch-sensitive materials. To test for notch-sensitivity,
    tensile strength can be plotted against the relative length of the notch (expressed
    as a fraction of the strip width). A notch-insensitive material is indicated by
    a straight line (Vincent 1990; Lucas et al. 1991). However, we had insufficient
    time between collection and the time when it was considered testing should be
    completed to test notch sensitivity. In addition, the small leaves of many species
    prevented a sufficiently wide range of notch lengths being accurately applied
    to allow testing of notch sensitivity. There was no solution to this problem.
    Any effect was minimised by standardising the relative notch length as far as
    possible. It was impossible to obtain the recommended aspect ratio from lamina
    tissue alone in the small- and narrow-leaved species (Acacia suaveolens, Banksia
    spp., Platylobium obtusangulum, Hibbertia aspera, Leptospermum laevigatum and
    Monotoca scoparia) and therefore the test strips of these species included the
    midrib and leaf margins. In Melaleuca squarrosa we could not maintain the aspect
    ratio and whole leaves were used. The fracture length of the leaf was measured
    using callipers and lamina thickness was measured as for the punch test to estimate
    the cross-sectional area of the fractured leaf, corrected for the area of the
    initial notch. The head speed was set at 0.5 mm s-1. Figure 2 illustrates a typical
    tearing force-displacement plot from which the tensile strength and toughness
    were derived (Table 2). The initial linear section of the slope could not be consistently
    detected. Therefore, measurement of stiffness was abandoned.

    marginata. A Universal Testing Machine (Chatillon Universal Tension and Compression
    Tester, model UTSE-2) was modified to produce a data output of 800 points per
    second to a personal computer. Punching, tearing and shearing tests were undertaken
    and the mechanical properties (Table 2) derived from force-displacement curves
    using software written by M. Logan (Monash University). Toughness was measured
    as the area under the force-displacement curve until complete fracture, which
    we term work to fracture.  Some aspects of these tests have been evaluated more
    recently by Aranwela et al. (1999). TEARING TEST A longitudinal strip of lamina
    32-40 mm long and 4-5 mm wide was cut from the middle of the left-hand side of
    each leaf, where large enough, such that the length was more than 8 times the
    width to counter the effects of necking (Vincent 1990; Lucas et al. 1991). Test
    strips were clamped in the force-tester using pneumatic clamps set at 350 kPa.
    The clamped ends of the test strips were wrapped in damp absorbent tissue to reduce
    cell collapse that might lead to low force readings due to the lamina breaking
    at this point. The strips were inspected following the test to determine if slippage
    had occurred. Where it was detected the test was repeated on a fresh strip. The
    strips were notched on the left-hand side up to a known length of 2 mm, maintaining
    a constant ratio of notch to test strip width as far as possible. The notch directs
    the position of fracture so the test strip does not break at the clamps. However,
    this might cause a stress concentration at the notch, possibly leading to inaccurate
    estimation of fracture properties in notch-sensitive materials. To test for notch-sensitivity,
    tensile strength can be plotted against the relative length of the notch (expressed

    scissors in shearing tests (Lucas and Pereira 1990; Lucas et al. 1991; Choong
    et al. 1992). In this method the approach angle is constantly changing, thereby
    altering the amount of tissue being sheared as the blades close and rendering
    the data more difficult to interpret. In the following tests a guillotine with
    silver-steel gauge plates was mounted onto the Chatillon Universal force-testing
    machine. The cutting edge was horizontal in the lower blade and 12deg in the upper
    blade. This pro- vided a constant approach angle of 12deg. The widest part of
    each leaf was placed beneath the upper stationary blade and the bottom, horizontal
    blade moved at a displacement speed set at 0.5 mm s-1, shearing the test leaf
    into two parts. Neither blade was raked but the bottom blade had a relief angle
    of c. 5deg. A blank run of the blades was undertaken before every 15-20 test runs
    to record background friction and was subtracted from the test force- displacement
    curves. The blade was started in exactly the same place each time to standardise
    background friction. A transverse cut was made across the leaf, midway between
    the base and tip, including the midrib. Initial trials indicated that the midrib
    and 2deg veins could be distinguished from the intercostal lamina in a trans-
    verse cut, thereby allowing additional information about these components. However,
    the experimental force-displacement plots showed considerable variation among
    species in shape, and dis- crimination of veins (Fig. 3). The only consistent
    measurements that could be made were of work to fracture obtained from the full
    transverse cut. The cross-sectional area of the leaf at the shearing plane was
    estimated by measurement of leaf width by callipers and leaf thickness as in the
    punch test to allow work to be ex- pressed per unit leaf width and thickness (Table
    2).
