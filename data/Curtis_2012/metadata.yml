  description: Study investigating relationships between leaf traits that protect
    against critically high leaf temperatures and how these traits vary within a biome.
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: 'Study area and species selection The study was conducted in
    north-west New South Wales, Australia, in an area bounded by the Barrier and Byngnano
    Ranges at Mutawintji National Park in the south and the Grey Range at Sturt National
    Park in the north (Fig. 1). The sampling region has a hot, arid climate with an
    average maximum summer temperature reaching >44 deg C and annual precipitation
    averaging <250mm (Australian Government Bureau of Meteorology 2011). The study
    employed a limited environmental and geographical context as this is most suitable
    when the level of replication is species (Brown and Maurer 1987). Ninety-five
    species of trees, shrubs and herbs native to arid New South Wales were selected
    for sampling. Species spanned 76 genera and 40 families, selected to maximise
    phylogenetic diversity and leaf trait variation evident throughout the sampling
    region. Sampling protocol: In this study we focused on the bivariate relationships
    of leaf traits that can protect against excessive radiation. Leaves included both
    true leaves and photosynthetic plant organs that essentially function as a leaf
    when true leaves are absent, i.e., cladodes and phyllodes. Additionally, for species
    with compound leaves, the unit of measurement was the leaflet. The leaflet is
    deemed to act as a discrete unit influencing plant-habitat interactions (Niklas
    1999), e.g. with respect to boundary layer convection, and is thus of greater
    relevance to this study in terms of thermodynamics than the entire compound leaf.'

  methods: All morphological leaf traits were measured on a minimum of three leaves
    from each of five plants (i.e. >= 15 leaves) for all 95 species. Sample leaves
    were collected from the outer north-facing canopy, where incident radiation is
    greatest in the southern hemisphere. Leaves were selected for sampling based on
    being healthy, fully expanded and of comparable age, i.e. having emerged in the
    most recent leaf flush (if perennial) or the middle of the current season (if
    annual or ephemeral). Leaves were then scanned on a flatbed scanner and stored
    for further measurements. Leaf area, leaf length, and leaf width were obtained
    from the scanned images using the graphic program ImageJ version 1.43r (United
    States National Institute of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA).

    (i.e. <0.005 g), multiple leaves (5-20) were collected and measured together and
    the mean obtained. In such cases, values for LMA and leaf water content were based
    on means. Leaf thickness was measured in the field using digital callipers (accurate
    to 0.01 mm) placed away from major veins, midway along the leaf blade. If leaf
    thickness varied notably among leaves from the same species, up to 10 individual
    leaves per plant were measured to ensure that the variation was captured.

    at least 2 h after collection to fully hydrate before measurements of fresh weight.
    All fresh and dry weights were measured using a precision analytical balance sensitive
    to 0.001 g.

- var_in: VIS %R (460-680nm)
  unit_in: '%'
  trait_name: leaf_reflectance
  value_type: site_mean
  replicates: 5
  methods: Reflectance of visible and near infrared wavelengths was measured in 0.5-nm
    increments between 300 and 1100 nm, as a percentage of incoming light for each
    species using a SpectraWiz fibre optic spectroradiometer probe and configured
    SL1 Tungsten Halogen light source (StellarNet Inc., Tampa, FL, USA). Prior to
    each leaf measurement the instrument was referenced to dark and light standards.
    Reflectance measurements were made on the upper surface of a representative leaf
    taken from the outer north-facing canopy for each species. As spectral variation
    can vary within a species seasonally (Ehleringer and Bjorkman 1978), all measurements
    for this study were made within a 3-week period during autumn.

questions:
  contributor: In the data file columns 6 to 11 (F to K excel columns) have a series
    of numeric codes. Do you have a key for what these values mean? And in some cases,
    I'm not sure what the column headers mean.
  question2: Column 11 (K) indicates it is a location key - does this provide more
    precise information on sampling location? If possible, we like to assign a latitude/longitude
    to each observation in AusTraits, even if it is approximate. (I can otherwise
    use a value that is approximately in the middle of the box indicating the study
    area, but if there are known sampling locations, that would be preferred.)
