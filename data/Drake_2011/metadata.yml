  description: We studied the water acquisition strategy and hydraulic and photosynthetic
    properties of Tuart (Eucalyptus gomphocephala D.C.), a large coastal tree species
    that occupies seasonally dry habitats underlain by superficial aquifers.
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: plant_size
  sampling_strategy: Plant material and the study area ^p Two study sites, separated
    by 15 km, were selected within Yalgorup National Park (32.90S; 115.69E) in south-western
    Australia. Water tables were much deeper at one site compared with the second
    site (averaging 8.04 and 2.30 m below the natural surface for Site 1 and Site
    2, respectively). Between 1950 and 2010, annual average rainfall for the area
    was 824 mm, of which only 4% fell during summer; the average daily maximum temperature
    in summer during this period was 29 Â°C (Australian Bureau of Meteorology 2010).
    Soils in Yalgorup National Park which are associated with E. gomphocephala are
    generally calcareous, sandy and with limestone features, occurring as interdispersed
    fragments, solid layers and outcrops that have been exposed by weathering. Specific
    to this study, both sites had a dark-brown sandy A-horizon grading to a white/yellow
    sandy B-horizon interdispersed with limestone fragments. The depths over which
    the A-horizon occurred differed between sites. At Site 1 the A-horizon extended
    to ~1 m whereas at Site 2 the transition to the B-horizon was at 0.5 m. ^p The
    sites each consisted of a 50 m x 50 m plot within which all measurements were
    taken. The study species, E. gomphocephala, was a canopy dominant at both sites,
    a range of size classes being represented (characterized by diameter at breast
    height (DBH)) by both seedlings (DBH = 0.02-0.05 m) and mature trees (DBH = 0.38-1.70
    m). Tree density was similar at both sites, 128 stems ha-1 at Site 1 and 152 stems
    ha-1 at Site 2. The study began in January 2004 and was concluded in January 2005.

  methods: The leaf water potential (MPa) was determined before dawn (04:30-06:00
    local standard time) during February and October in leaves from each individual
    (n = 4 plants per size class and site) using a Scholander-type pressure chamber
    (Soilmoisture Equipment Corp, Model 3005, Santa Barbara, CA, USA) (Scholander
    et al. 1964). Leaves from the upper canopy of each size class were collected and
    stored cool in snap-lock bags prior to measurement.

    leaf water potential (12:00-13:00 local standard time) was measured in the same
    individuals and the soil-to-leaf water potential gradient was calculated as the
    difference between pre-dawn and midday measurements.

  methods: Hydraulic conductivity per unit stem cross-sectional area (KS) and per
    unit leaf area (KL) was determined for stems of a greater length than the longest
    measured vessel (~10 cm) and with a diameter of 0.3-1.0 cm. Hydraulic conductivity
    (expressed per unit of stem area and leaf area) was measured using a steady-state
    flow meter (Feild et al. 2001, Franks et al. 2007). Intact terminal branches were
    collected every month from February 2004 to October 2004 from each individual
    plant (four plants for each size class and site) and immediately transported to
    a laboratory. Branches were collected before sunrise to eliminate the potential
    effect of transient, daytime xylem embolisms (Sperry and Sullivan 1992). There
    was no visual evidence of pith in the stems under investigation in this study
    and so xylem area was assumed to be close to stem cross-sectional area.

    areas were measured with an area meter (WinDias Image Analysis System; Delta-T
    Devices, Cambridge, UK). Some native embolisms were likely even in the wet season;
    these were accepted, since this study was concerned only with existing, natural
    hydraulic conductivities under the given environmental conditions. It is likely,
    therefore, that stems could have operated with higher values of KS and KL if these
    embolisms had been removed.

  trait_name: leaf_fluorescence_fv_over_fm
  entity_type: population
  value_type: mean
  basis_of_value: measurement
  replicates: 4
  methods: The maximum photon yield of photosystem II, the ratio of variable fluorescence
    to maximum fluorescence (FV/FM), was determined near midday (11.30-13.00 local
    standard time) once a month, using one sunlit canopy leaf from each individual
    plant (n = 4 plants per size class and site) with a pulse-modulated fluorescence
    probe (Model OS1-FL; Opti Sciences Inc, Tyngsboro, MA, USA). Leaves were allowed
    to adapt to dark for 5-10 min before the application of a single saturating light
    pulse. We acknowledge that measuring FV/FM in this way does not provide a rigorous
    quantitative value of the quantum yield of PSII and the reason for stress-induced
    decreases in FV/FM are complex. However, our goal was not to interpret FV/FM values
    at a biochemical level but rather to obtain a relative measure of the maximum
    quantum yield of PSII between sites and in seedlings and trees
