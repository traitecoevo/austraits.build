  description: Study investigating life-history associations of terrestrial dioecious
    plant species in central southern Australia and whether the proportion of dioecy
    is correlated with life-history and/or climate factors.
  basis_of_record: literature
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: A review of the Australian Herbarium databases was undertaken
    to map the distribution of dioecy in the terrestrial native flora of central southern
    Australia, as defined by 66 contiguous IBRA subregions covering the region and
    spanning Mediterranean to arid climates (Fig. 1, inset map). The electronic Flora
    of South Australia 4th edition (eFloraSA; Barker et al. 2005) was also used to
    help determine the likely breeding systems of the native plants within the search
    region, supplemented with information from the online Flora of South Australia
    5th edition, online floras of Victoria, New South Wales, Western Australia, Flora
    of Australia and The Families and Genera of Vascular Plants series (ed. Kubitzki
    1993–2016), as well as some taxon-specific publications (Supplementary Table S1).
    Species without, or with unclear breeding-system determinations were excluded
    from the analyses, and where reports of breeding systems were contradictory, the
    eFloraSA was followed for consistency.

  methods: A review of the Australian Herbarium databases was undertaken to map the
    distribution of dioecy in the terrestrial native flora of central southern Australia,
    as defined by 66 contiguous IBRA subregions covering the region and spanning Mediterranean
    to arid climates (Fig. 1, inset map). The electronic Flora of South Australia
    4th edition (eFloraSA; Barker et al. 2005) was also used to help determine the
    likely breeding systems of the native plants within the search region, supplemented
    with information from the online Flora of South Australia 5th edition, online
    floras of Victoria, New South Wales, Western Australia, Flora of Australia and
    The Families and Genera of Vascular Plants series (ed. Kubitzki 1993–2016), as
    well as some taxon-specific publications (Supplementary Table S1). Species without,
    or with unclear breeding-system determinations were excluded from the analyses,
    and where reports of breeding systems were contradictory, the eFloraSA was followed
    for consistency. Species were classified as dioecious so long as they were described
    as predominantly dioecious, or where multiple sexual systems were listed, dioecy
    was the first mentioned. For example, for a species described as ‘dioecious, with
    some instances of monoecious plants’ (e.g. Allocasuarina), or ‘dioecious, or rarely
    polygamodioecious’ (e.g. Dodonaea), species were classified as dioecious on the
    assumption that if monoecious individuals were common, the description would have
    classified these species as polygamodioecious. Examples of species not classified
    as dioecious in this study are those described as exclusively ‘polygamodioecious’,
    ‘temporally dioecious’ or ‘monoecious or dioecious’. Finally, as the study focused
    on in-land species, dioecious marine plants were excluded.
