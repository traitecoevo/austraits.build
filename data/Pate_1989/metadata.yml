  description: Investigations of 55 species of Daviesia show 24 to have anomalous
    secondary vascular development in their roots and the remainder to be of conventional
    root anatomy.
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: Plants of various ages from 55 species of Daviesia were examined
    in native habitat in a wide range of localities throughout SW Australia (the main
    centre of diversity of the species), and at selected locations in New South Wales,
    Victoria and South Australia where other species of the genus are known to occur.
    Plants in cultivation at the Australian National Botanic Gardens, Canberra, Australia,
    were also examined.

  methods: Macroscopic observations on the external morphology of whole roots or on
    the anatomy of longitudinally or transversely cut parts of old woody roots were
    made on freshly collected material. Fresh roots or material preserved in 70% ethanol
    were hand-sectioned and stained with aniline sulphate or toluidine blue (pH 4.2)
    to distinguish lignified tissue, and with iodine solution to identify starch.
    ^p Examinations of the overall architecture of the root vasculature were made
    on 0.5- 1 .O cm thick transverse slices of roots previously softened by immersion
    in concentrated HCI, 909; ethanol ( 1 to 1 ) for 1 h followed by saturated ammonium
    oxalate for 24 h. Soft parenchymatous tissue was then scraped away to reveal the
    concentric layers of vascular strands. The vascular anatomy of whole seedlings
    was examined following clearing of fresh material for 10-30 minutes in a boiling
    solution of chloral hydrate, phenol and lactic acid (I to I to 3) acidified to
    pH I with HCI. ^p Plant material for light microscopy was fixed with Karnovsky's
    fixative, embedded in glycol methacrylate, sectioned at 2 pm and stained with
    toluidine blue (pH 4.2) and periodic acid-Schiff's (PAS) reagent. Certain material
    was viewed with a Philips 505 scanning electron microscope after preparation by
    acetone dehydration, critical point drying, and gold coating in a sputter coater.
