  description: An investigation of variation in the wood density of the widespread
    mangrove species Avicennia marina.
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: Our study compares the density and structure of the wood of A.
    marina and its correlation with tree growth rates at two sampling locations where
    A. marina is dominant, the Firth of Thames, New Zealand (NZ) and Giralia Bay,
    Exmouth Gulf in Western Australia (WA). ^p The Firth of Thames (37.18°S, 175.4°E)
    is an embayment of about 19-km width in the northern part of the Hauraki Depression,
    NZ (Hochstein and Nixon 1979). In this site, an extensive mangrove forest with
    varying forest structure (ranging between ~0.3 to 3 m in height) has developed
    since the 1950s (Lovelock et al. 2010). The climate is wet, with a mean annual
    rainfall of 1,400 mm year-1 and cool, with a mean annual air temperature of 15
    °C (National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA) 2011). Our second
    sampling location at Giralia Bay in the Exmouth Gulf, WA (22.4°S, 114.3°E) is
    arid, with a mean annual rainfall of 300 mm year-1 and warm, with a mean annual
    air temperature of 25°C. Cyclones occur every two to three years in the Exmouth
    region causing short periods of intense rainfall and flooding (Lovelock et al.
    2011) and wind gusts in excess of 90 km/h (Australian Bureau of Meteorology 2011).
    ^p In January 2007, we collected five mature stems from each of three sites across
    the intertidal zone in NZ. The sites encompassed trees of differing sizes and
    ages (Lovelock et al. 2011). The forest at the Firth of Thames, NZ is older towards
    the landward side (trees recruited in ~1978) and younger on the seaward edge (trees
    recruited in ~ 1996). In the NZ forests tree size varies in a typical manner for
    mangroves (Feller et al. 2010), with tall trees on the seaward, more frequently
    inundated site (NZ-Seaward) to scrub forests ~0.3 m in height in the landward,
    less frequently inundated site (NZ-Landward-1, 350 m from the seaward edge). The
    older 1978 forest is a relict fringing forest (NZ-Landward-2, 620 m from the seaward
    edge) that has tall trees, but is inundated less frequently due to sediment accretion
    and forest development in a seaward direction over time. At Giralia Bay in WA,
    we collected wood from six mature stems from the seaward edge of the forest (WA-Seaward)
    in October 2008. Similar to the fringing site in NZ, the seaward fringing forest
    at Giralia Bay is inundated by the tide twice daily. ^p At each site (three at
    NZ and one in WA), we assessed the porewater salinity. We collected water samples
    from 30 cm depth using a suction device (McKee et al. 1988) and analysed them
    with a handheld refractometer (W/ATC 300011, SPER Scientific Scottsdale, USA).

  methods: All our measurements were made in the 3-4 outermost layers of wood (Fig.
    1a). Wood density was measured for each tree from 1 cm x 1 cm x 2 cm rectangular
    prisms cut from the outer layers of the wood. Wood density was calculated as the
    ratio of the oven-dry mass of the wood sample divided by the mass of water displaced
    by its fresh (green) volume (Chave et al. 2006). Using oven-dried (60 °C) and
    sanded wood discs (Fig. 1a, b), the number of growth layers, defined as ontogenetic
    units of phloem and xylem, was counted using an Olympus SZH10 microscope (Tokyo,
    Japan). A growth layer was counted if it crossed a line drawn from pith to bark
    along the maximum radius of the stem disc (Schmitz et al. 2007). The proportion
    of phloem per growth layer was calculated as the width of the phloem band divided
    by the total width of the growth layer, including both xylem and phloem, measured
    along the radius of the stem disc. Given it can be difficult to resolve small
    vessels from sanded wood discs, ~1 cm3 cubes were cut from the discs to make transverse
    microsections (Fig. 1c) that were double stained with Safranin-Alcian blue. We
    photographed the sections with an Olympus BX61 microscope (Tokyo, Japan). From
    the photographs we measured 100-200 xylem vessels and 100-200 fibres for each
    stem. Xylem and phloem area was measured per layer. The number of vessels was
    counted and the perpendicular axes of the vessel lumina were measured (Fig. 1c).
    All the measurements were done using Image Pro Plus version 5.0.1 (MediaCybernetics,
    Maryland, USA). We calculated the xylem vessel diameter (D) following the ellipse
    equation of Lewis (1992) (Eq. 1), and the total vessel lumen area (XA) accounting
    for vessel density (VD) and vessel area (VA). Fibre wall thickness was calculated
    as the radial distance from fibre lumen 1 to fibre lumen 2 divided by two.
