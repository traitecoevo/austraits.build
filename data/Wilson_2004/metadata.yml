  description: The aim of this paper was to develop guidelines for ecological fire
    regimes using the Banksia woodland on the Gnangara Groundwater System in Western
    Australia as a case study.
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: The Gnangara Groundwater System represents a distinct water catchment
    of approximately 220 000 ha and is located on the Swan Coastal Plain just north
    of Perth (Figure 1) (Government of Western Australia, 2009a). The groundwater
    system provides approximately 60% of Perth's drinking water. The long term average
    annual rainfall of 780 mm (1945-2007) experienced a major decline after 2001 (683
    mm) and declining rainfall and runoff levels in the past 30 years have heavily
    impacted on water availability and the ecosystems in the region (Government of
    Western Australia, 2009a). The study area is located in the south-west of Western
    Australia which is recognized as a global biodiversity hotspot (Hopper and Gioia,
    2004) and although the area has undergone intensive urban, rural and pine plantation
    development, extensive areas of remnant woodlands (101 212 ha) remain (Figure
    1) (Wilson and Valentine, 2009). The Banksia woodland has significant biodiversity
    values, containing numerous threatened species and ecological communities (Wilson
    and Valentine, 2009). ^p The vegetation communities of the study area are dominated
    by a Banksia overstorey and sporadic stands of Eucalyptus, Corymbia and Allocasuarina,
    and an understorey consisting mainly of low shrubs from the Myrtaceae, Fabaceae
    and Proteaceae families (Barrett and Pin Tay, 2005; Gibson et al., 1994), and
    a variety of floristic communities including coastal shrublands on shallow sands
    and Acacia shrublands (Government of Western Australia, 2000). A complex mosaic
    of wetlands also occur and are commonly fringed by Melaleuca spp. and Banksia
    littoralis (Gibson et al., 1994; Semeniuk et al., 1990). Banksia woodlands (Banksia
    vegetation including Banksia interspersed with eucalypts such as Marri) are the
    predominant community (51 914 ha) , with smaller areas of Melaleuca / Eucalyptus
    rudis woodlands (3 132 ha) (hereafter referred to as 'Melaleuca woodlands'). The
    study area is known for its high species richness of plants (Valentine et al.,
    2009a) and terrestrial vertebrate taxa, including a number of threatened taxa
    (Government of Western Australia, 2009a, 2009b; Mitchell et al., 2003; Wilson
    et al., 2012), such as the critically endangered Pseudemydura umbrina (western
    swamp tortoise) and the endangered Calyptorhynchus latirostris (Carnaby's blackcockatoo).
    Prescribed burning programmes are undertaken within the study area in State Forest
    and in parks and reserves (Muller, 2010). In the Banksia woodland fine fuels accumulate
    rapidly in the first four years after fire and at 6 years, fuel load stabilizes
    (~ 6-8 tonnes per hectare (t ha-1) (Burrows and McCaw, 1990). Live scrub contributes
    about 50% of the total fuel weight, with dead suspended scrub and ground litter
    making up the remainder. The amount of fuel that accumulates four years after
    a fire (~5.5 t ha-1) is sufficient to support an intense and fast moving wildfire
    under extreme fire weather conditions. Further, the live plant material dries
    rapidly and any fire is susceptible to rapid spread by wind (Burrows and McCaw,
    1990).

  methods: Information on post-fire responses was obtained from the Vegetation Species

    1998-2009), from recovery plans for threatened species and Threatened Ecological
    Communities of the area that are covered by State and Commonwealth legislation
    and require specific fire regimes for protection (Brown et al., 1998; Evans et
    al., 2003). As species responses vary from site to site (Vivian et al., 2010)
    and as most of the plant post-fire responses were obtained from the northern Jarrah
    forest, we supplemented this data by recording the post-fire responses of a number
    of flora species during post-fire and chronosequence floristic surveys conducted
    in the Banksia woodlands (Mickle et al., 2010a, 2010b, 2009; Valentine et al.,
    2009a; Wilson et al., 2010a).

    2009a; Wilson et al., 2010a). The data were collated and key fire response species
    (i.e., species most likely to be affected by long or short intervals between fires)
    were then selected based on vital attribute criteria including regeneration strategy
    (species killed by fire and relying of seeds for reproduction), juvenile period
    (greater than 48 months), conservation status (Declared Rare Flora) and endemism
    (endemic to the GGS). The definition of minimum fire interval used in this paper
    is based on Burrows (2008). The minimum fire interval is approximately twice the
    juvenile period of the slowest maturing species. The maximum fire interval was
    taken as the senescence time for the longer lived woody species (Enright et al.,
    1998).The juvenile period was defined as the time for at least 50% of a population
    of a species to have flowered following fire because this level of flowering is
    considered sufficient for viable reproduction (Burrows et al., 2008).
