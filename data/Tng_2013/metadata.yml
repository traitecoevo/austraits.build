      description: 'We sampled rainforest, and the surrounding giant eucalypt forest and open vegetation but did not sample treeless grasslands or sedgelands in two regions: tropical north Queensland and cool temperate Tasmania. North Queensland experiences a humid tropical climate with a typical site (Herberton: 17°38′S, 145°39′E) having a mean maximum annual temperature of 27.1°C and a mean annual rainfall of 2240 mm. The climate is thermally aseasonal, but has a summer-rainfall bias [46]. The regions of Tasmania studied here experience a cool temperate climate with a mean maximum annual temperature of 18.4°C and a mean annual rainfall of 2070mm for a typical site (Arve Valley: 43°14′S, 146°79′E). The climate is thermally seasonal and has winter dominated precipitation'

  sampling_strategy: In each region the three vegetation types are readily recognised, allowing for a priori allocation of vegetation samples and species; (i) rainforests have closed canopies and an absence of eucalypts; (ii) giant eucalypt forests are emergent above either rainforest, or a mix of shrubby and grassy understoreys, and; (iii) open vegetation is dominated by shorter eucalypts and has shrubs and herbaceous (including grass) species tolerant of high light environments. Tropical open forests/woodlands have a well developed grassy understorey and are classified as tropical savannas. Open vegetation in the temperate region is referred to here as savanna, as they can have some structural similarities with tropical eucalypt savannas. In both regions, the tree and shrub species measured for functional traits (Table 1) were selected on the basis of their relative abundance in at least one of the localities, with the aim of capturing a representative spread of species in all three vegetation types. While many of the species sampled were widespread within their thermal zone, the trait data for any given species were taken from specimens collected from only one locality. The few species that occurred in more than one vegetation type were only sampled in the vegetation type where they occurred at the highest abundance. This selection process, based on extensive fieldwork to indentify species and assess their community affinities, was designed to minimise the confounding effect of giant eucalypt forest at different successional stages having varying components of rainforest species. Although vines were common in the tropical vegetation types, they were not sampled for trait measurements because of their low representativeness in temperate rainforest and giant eucalypt forest, and also because not all the functional traits used for our tree and shrub species will be applicable to vines.

  notes for Austraits: The manuscript also reports on bark thickness. We should include this data. They also have leaf slenderness data, which we might want to include.

traits:
- var_in: 13C %
  unit_in: per mille
  trait_name: leaf_delta13C
  value_type: mean
  replicates: 4-5
  methods: For leaf carbon isotope ratio (δ13C) determination, the leaves of four to five individuals were bulked, ground finely and δ13C assessed by the School of Plant Biology, University of Western Australia.
- var_in: leaf area mm2
  unit_in: cm2
  trait_name: leaf_area
  value_type: mean
  replicates: 4-5
  methods: For leaf area and leaf mass per area (LMA), two to 20 replicates per individual of sun-exposed leaves were obtained from the tree or shrub mid-canopy. For species with compound leaves, leaflets were taken to be the functional unit equivalent to leaves. For shrubs and short trees, an extension cutter was used to obtain the leaves but for trees taller than 10 meters, canopy branches were collected using a slingshot and weighted line. Only fully expanded leaves were used and these were scanned with a flatbed scanner and the leaf scans were processed by imaging software ImageJ to obtain leaf areas.

  unit_in: g/m2

For species with compound leaves, leaflets were taken to be the functional unit equivalent to leaves.

Only fully expanded leaves were used and these were scanned with a flatbed scanner and the leaf scans were processed by imaging software ImageJ to obtain leaf areas. These leaves were then dried to a constant weight at 60°C and weighed. LMA was then determined by dividing leaf dry weight by the leaf area.
- var_in: WD g cm3
  unit_in: mg/mm3
  trait_name: wood_density
  value_type: mean
  replicates: 4-5
  methods: For wood density, we followed a protocol similar to Falster & Westoby [51]. For trees, we collected branches and obtained two to five 5cm segments of the branch approximately 1m from the branch tip, whereas for shrubs, we collected wood segments by destructive sampling from the base of the shrub. The bark was removed from the wood segments and the displacement method was used to obtain the branch segment fresh volume. The branch segments were then dried at 60°C for a week, weighed, and the wood density calculated as dry weight divided by fresh volume.
- var_in: Height (m)
  unit_in: m
  trait_name: plant_height
  value_type: mean
  replicates: .na
  methods: Maximum height (Htmax) was obtained from literature sources [52–56].
