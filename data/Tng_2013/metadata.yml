  description: various traits for 128 trees and shrubs from transition zones
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: In each region the three vegetation types are readily recognised,
    allowing for a priori allocation of vegetation samples and species; (i) rainforests
    have closed canopies and an absence of eucalypts; (ii) giant eucalypt forests
    are emergent above either rainforest, or a mix of shrubby and grassy understoreys,
    and; (iii) open vegetation is dominated by shorter eucalypts and has shrubs and
    herbaceous (including grass) species tolerant of high light environments. Tropical
    open forests/woodlands have a well developed grassy understorey and are classified
    as tropical savannas. Open vegetation in the temperate region is referred to here
    as savanna, as they can have some structural similarities with tropical eucalypt
    savannas. In both regions, the tree and shrub species measured for functional
    traits (Table 1) were selected on the basis of their relative abundance in at
    least one of the localities, with the aim of capturing a representative spread
    of species in all three vegetation types. While many of the species sampled were
    widespread within their thermal zone, the trait data for any given species were
    taken from specimens collected from only one locality. The few species that occurred
    in more than one vegetation type were only sampled in the vegetation type where
    they occurred at the highest abundance. This selection process, based on extensive
    fieldwork to indentify species and assess their community affinities, was designed
    to minimise the confounding effect of giant eucalypt forest at different successional
    stages having varying components of rainforest species. Although vines were common
    in the tropical vegetation types, they were not sampled for trait measurements
    because of their low representativeness in temperate rainforest and giant eucalypt
    forest, and also because not all the functional traits used for our tree and shrub
    species will be applicable to vines.

    description: We sampled rainforest, and the surrounding giant eucalypt forest
      and open vegetation but did not sample treeless grasslands or sedgelands in
      two regions- tropical north Queensland and cool temperate Tasmania. North Queensland
      experiences a humid tropical climate with a typical site (Herberton 17°38'S,
      145°39'E) having a mean maximum annual temperature of 27.1°C and a mean annual
      rainfall of 2240 mm. The climate is thermally aseasonal, but has a summer-rainfall
      bias [46]. The regions of Tasmania studied here experience a cool temperate
      climate with a mean maximum annual temperature of 18.4°C and a mean annual rainfall
      of 2070mm for a typical site (Arve Valley 43°14'S, 146°79'E). The climate is
      thermally seasonal and has winter dominated precipitation

traits:
- var_in: 13C %
  unit_in: per mille
  trait_name: leaf_delta13C
  value_type: site_mean
  replicates: 4-5
  methods: For leaf carbon isotope ratio (d13C) determination, the leaves of four
    to five individuals were bulked, ground finely and d13C assessed by the School
    of Plant Biology, University of Western Australia.
- var_in: leaf area mm2
  unit_in: cm2
  trait_name: leaf_area
  value_type: site_mean
  replicates: 4-5
  methods: For leaf area and leaf mass per area (LMA), two to 20 replicates per individual
    of sun-exposed leaves were obtained from the tree or shrub mid-canopy. For species
    with compound leaves, leaflets were taken to be the functional unit equivalent
    to leaves. For shrubs and short trees, an extension cutter was used to obtain
    the leaves but for trees taller than 10 meters, canopy branches were collected
    using a slingshot and weighted line. Only fully expanded leaves were used and
    these were scanned with a flatbed scanner and the leaf scans were processed by
    imaging software ImageJ to obtain leaf areas.

    a constant weight at 60°C and weighed. LMA was then determined by dividing leaf
    dry weight by the leaf area.
- var_in: WD g cm3
  unit_in: mg/mm3
  trait_name: wood_density
  value_type: site_mean
  replicates: 4-5
  methods: For wood density, we followed a protocol similar to Falster & Westoby [51].
    For trees, we collected branches and obtained two to five 5cm segments of the
    branch approximately 1m from the branch tip, whereas for shrubs, we collected
    wood segments by destructive sampling from the base of the shrub. The bark was
    removed from the wood segments and the displacement method was used to obtain
    the branch segment fresh volume. The branch segments were then dried at 60°C for
    a week, weighed, and the wood density calculated as dry weight divided by fresh
    volume.
- var_in: Height (m)
  unit_in: m
  trait_name: plant_height

  methods: Maximum height (Htmax) was obtained from literature sources [52–56].

  austraits: The manuscript also reports on bark thickness. We should include
    this data. They also have leaf slenderness data, which we might want to include.
