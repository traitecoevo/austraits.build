  description: seed traits for lowP sydney sandstone sites from Ian Wright
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: Three random individuals of each species were located, away from
    track edges. For each individual three random branches with tips at the outer
    surface of the plant's crown were chosen. The first branch-point back from the
    growing tip was located. Leaves expanded to more than 50% of typical final length
    were counted from the tip back to the branch point. Twig diameters were measured
    (vernier callipers) in the middle of the internode above the branch point. Twig
    cross-sectional area was calculated from the diameters. A fully expanded leaf
    along the twig was sampled for area and mass measurements. The sampled leaf was
    selected from among those that had not lost part of their area to herbivory or
    other damage, and to be near the median size. Projected area of the leaf was measured,
    laid flat on squared paper, and the leaf was dried to constant mass and weighed.
    Total area of leaves along a twig was estimated as number of leaves multiplied
    by area of the representative leaf sampled, and similarly for total mass of leaves
    along the twig.

    description: The main dataset concerns perennial dicotyledonous species from low-nutrient
      Hawkesbury sandstone near Sydney, Australia (66 mg kg_1 total soil P, from five
      samples to 10 cm depth spaced across the site, amalgamated before analysis).
      The vegetation there is woody, sclerophyll, evergreen, fire-prone and species-rich.
      Data were collected in August 1999 as a practical exercise in Biol368 Ecology
      and Evolution, Macquarie University. The field site was on a broadly level plateau
      at latitude 33 °41'38''S, longitude 151 °08'35''E in Ku-Ring-Gai Chase National
      Park. In this vegetation seedlings establish following fire, or pre-existing
      individuals resprout. The previous fire occurred in 1990 at this site; consequently
      the individuals studied were well-established. Heights ranged from 20 cm for
      some low woody herbs, to 6 m for some eucalypts. Rainfall at the site averages
      ca. 1,200 mm distributed through all seasons of the year. Growth slows but does
      not stop across the cooler months.
