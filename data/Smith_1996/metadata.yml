  description: collection of trait data from Nothofagus forests across Australia,
    New Zealand and South America
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: seedling sapling adult
  sampling_strategy: '2.3.1 Selection of sites: Sampling sites were sought in Tasmania,
    mainland Australia (Australia, for brevity), New Zealand and South America. These
    four regions are referred to as landmasses throughout this report. In comparison
    to the other landmasses, a greater number of study sites was established in New
    Zealand. This was in order to be able to focus on questions of community structure
    at the local and regional scales. In Tasmania, Australia and South America the
    principal aim in selecting sites was to encompass a range of tall, evergreen Nothofagus-dominated
    communities representative for each landmass. Locational, floristic and environmental
    data for each of the 17 study sites are presented in Chapter 3. ^p All sites comprised
    tall mature forest (average canopy height 30 m or more) dominated (at least 90%
    canopy cover) by one or more evergreen species of Nothofagus. Standardisation
    of climate to Meurks (1984) cool temperate or upper montane bioclimatic zone (MTWM
    c. 12.5-17.5C) was achieved by adjusting latitude and altitude, remaining within
    the latitudinal range 42 +- 3 deg S in all landmasses except Australia (where
    Nothofagus moorei forest has a scattered montane distribution from c. 25 S to
    32 S). Areas with particularly infertile soils (for example, over precambrian
    quartzite in Tasmania) were avoided. Steep terrain (>15 deg slope) and areas with
    impeded drainage were likewise avoided, as were narrow valleys in which shading
    by surrounding topography could be significant. Where slope was not negligible,
    southerly aspects were chosen if possible. Areas subject to human disturbance
    were avoided, and a buffer zone of at least 50 m was maintained, separating study
    sites from tracks, roads and other areas of human disturbance, as well as from
    sizeable natural clearings. ^p 2.3.2 Field sampling:  To standardise with respect
    to seasonal effects on texture, most sampling was done from the last month of
    spring (November) until the first month of Autumn (March). However, this could
    not be achieved for all sites and, in particular, mainland Australian sites were
    sampled at the beginning of spring (September-October) while some collections
    in southern New Zealand were made in late autumn (April-May). STUDY SITE LAYOUT
    Sampling was carried out within a 100 x 200 m study area at each site, the long
    axis being aligned perpendicular to the prevailing slope (where applicable) to
    ensure that elevation effects within the study area would be negligible. To avoid
    subjectivity in the choice of sampling area, its exact position was randomised
    within a 200 x 400 m area where possible. Five (occasionally, when available sampling
    time was limited, three or four) 20 x 20 m quadrats were located within the study
    area by stratified randomisation. As it was intended to sample only closed forest,
    quadrats were repositioned (to a different random point within the study area)
    if a canopy opening covered more than one-third of their area. QUADRAT SAMPLING
    In each quadrat, shoot presence of all vascular plant species was recorded. PSU
    densities were determined for each species present by hierarchical enumeration
    of subsamples, where PSU is the relevant photosynthetic unit, either a single
    leaf of the equivalent for certain species. This method of counting PSUs was applied
    in different ways for different types of species. In the case of functional types
    having a distinct modular hierarchy (e.g. many graminoids, which have tussocks
    divided into tillers, in turn divided into individual leaves), the average number
    of PSUs in first-order modules was determined, then the number of first-order
    modules in second-order modules, and so on, finally estimating the number of highest-order
    modules rooted in the entire quadrat. At each level, values were obtained for
    several modules, on different individuals if possible, to ensure that the mean
    for that level was as accurate as possible. The average numbers of units at each
    level for a species were multiplied together and divided by quadrat area (400
    m2) to determine its PSU density in the quadrat. In the case of species lacking
    a distinct modular hierarchy a similar protocol was followed, but modules were
    defined arbitrarily. Binoculars were used to facilitate enumeration of PSUs for
    canopy trees. All PSUs of all individuals rooted (or appearing to be rooted) in
    the quadrat, and only those individuals, were included in the density estimates.
    To determine whether epiphytic species not rooted at ground level appeared to
    occur within the quadrat, quadrats were projected visually upwards. Adult and
    juvenile forms of heteroblastic species, as well as seedlings (0-2 m), saplings
    and subcanopy individuals (2 m to 67% of mean canopy height), and canopy individuals
    (above 67% of mean canopy height) of canopy species, were treated as separate
    entities for the purposes of PSU density estimation and texture sampling (see
    below). As a record of the vertical distribution of each species, the proportion
    of its PSUs occurring in each of the following height classes within the quadrat
    was estimated visually: 0-0.3 m; 0.3-1 m; 1-2 m; 2-5 m; 5-10 m; 10-20 m; 20-30
    m; 30-40 m. The height of a representative canopy individual of each canopy species
    (as defined above) present in the quadrat was determined using a clinometer. Diameters
    at breast height 42 (DBH) were recorded for all canopy individuals using a diameter
    measuring tape. Breast height was taken at 1.6 m above ground level, except for
    buttressed trees, for which measurements were made just above the buttress. Soil
    samples were taken from the upper mineral horizon at three random points within
    each quadrat, and bulked to give one sample of c. 1 kg, representative for the
    quadrat. In Argentina only, soil samples from all quadrats at each site were bulked
    to give one sample per site. Mean slope across the quadrat (nearest 5 deg ) was
    estimated using an Abney level, and aspect (nearest 5 deg ) determined with a
    magnetic compass. Obvious features of the vegetation structure, composition and
    microtopography were noted.'

  methods: 'Chlorophyll a and b content were determined using a method adapted from
    Moran & Porath (1980), Moran (1982) and Inskeep & Bloom (1985) by A.J. Watkins,
    S.J. Clarke and the author. Leaf samples collected in the field were divided into
    three (occasionally two or one) replicate samples for each species. For each replicate,
    approximately 30 mg of macerated leaf material was introduced into a glass container.
    The container was weighed (1 mg precision) before and after addition of the leaf
    sample and the difference (the weight of the sample) recorded. Containers used
    were 10 ml screw-top test tubes (central and southern New Zealand sites), 10 ml
    soil vials (Tasmania) or 20 ml soil vials (northern New Zealand, Australia and
    South America). Larger glass containers (capacity c. 50 ml) were used for a small
    number of samples in Argentina. The data obtained from these were inconsistent
    with values elsewhere and were not used. 5 ml (for some sites, 4 ml) of N,N-dimethylformamide
    (DMF), retrieved with a pipette, were added to the container, the container was
    sealed, sheathed in aluminium foil to inhibit the entry of light, and stored,
    refrigerated at c. 4 deg C, for a period of 3-14 days. The resultant chlorophyll
    solution was analysed by spectrophotometry for absorptance in 1 cm cuvettes at
    wavelengths 647 nm and 664.5 nm, callibrating (to 0 absorptance) with fresh DMF.
    Chlorophyll A concentration is then calculated using the following formula: (12.7*A664
    - 2.79*A647)/FW.CHL*VOL.CHL*1E-4 (%) and Chlorophyll B concentration is calculated
    using this formula: (20.7*A647 - 4.62*A664)/FW.CHL*VOL.CHL*1E-4 (%), with chlorophyll
    A/B the ratio of chlorophyll A and B concentrations'
