  description: Quantifying the period of time after fire for obligate-seeding species to become reproductively mature (the juvenile period) to understand when the interval between two fires is too short to allow a plant population to develop the capacity to persist through the second fire.
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: Two locations were sampled in the Parker Range area, Western Australia, a `Eucalypt woodland` and `Low closed forests and tall closed shrubland`. At the Eucalypt woodland, 16-24 sites were sampled per species, with 20 individuals censused at each site. At the `low closed forest` 9-11 sites were sampled per species, with 20 individuals censused at each site. The time since the last fire at this locaiton spanned 10-~260 years. The Eucalpyt woodland site was sampled 5x post-fire and the low closed forest site was sampled 6x post-fire to determine when the first individual and 50% of the individuals at a site were fruiting. The time since the last fire at this locaiton spanned 9-47 years, plus an additional 'long unburnt site'.
