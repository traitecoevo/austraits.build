  description: A 6-year observational study of post-fire responses in the Lane Cove
    River and Narrabeen Lagoon catchment areas, following the 1994 fires.
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: Study areas ^p The Lane Cove River valley is situated in the
    northern Sydney metropolitan area (lat 33° 45’ S, long 151° 05’ E), in the Central
    Coast botanical subdivision of NSW. ^p The 1994 fires ^p The Lane Cove River fire
    began on 6 January 1994 in the Browns Waterhole area and was probably deliberately
    lit (NSW State Coroner 1995). The area of bushland burnt in the Lane Cove River
    catchment was variously estimated to be c. 383 ha (NSW NPWS 2002, DEC NSW 2005a,
    2006a) or c. 580 hectares (NSW State Coroner 1995, Gill & Moore 1998). The former
    estimate may possibly have been limited to bushland burnt in Lane Cove National
    Park, whilst the latter was for all bushland "affected" in the Lane Cove River
    area. The fires were generally described as being of a very high intensity (NSW
    State Coroner 1995). The fire in the Narrabeen Lagoon catchment area began on
    8 January 1994, having originated at Cottage Point on 7 January, and spread rapidly
    through the adjoining Ku-ringgai Chase National Park (NSW State Coroner 1995).
    On 8 January, and over the next few days, wildfire burnt through bushland in the
    Deep Creek, Mullet Creek, Middle Creek, Jamieson Park and Wheeler Creek areas.
    This fire event was estimated to have burnt c. 1000 ha in the eastern section
    (centred on Deep Creek) of Garigal National Park (DEC NSW 2005b, 2006b). Additional
    bushland in the Narrabeen Lagoon catchment area, outside of Garigal National Park,
    was also burnt. ^p Field observations ^p Field observations of fire responses
    of bushland plants were made in Lane Cove River catchment area between January
    1994 and October 1999 (a period of almost 6 years), with a few occasional observations
    in following years (Table 3). Field observations in the Narrabeen Lagoon catchment
    area, including any flowering or fruiting of plants, were made between March 1994
    and late October 1994 (over approximately 8 months). The longer period of study
    in the Lane Cove River area meant that more observations of postfire flowering
    and fruiting were made for plant species in that area, than in the Narrabeen Lagoon
    catchment. Observations were recorded while walking through burnt bushland after
    the fires. No fixed transects or quadrats were used. Observations were made along
    tracks, roads and walking trails throughout the study areas (Table 3). As wide
    a variety of habitats as possible were looked at, including bushland away from
    tracks and known to contain species or vegetation types that did not occur along
    the tracks. Most of the main tracks, and many of the minor ones, were walked at
    least once, and some, many times.. The total distance walked, while making observations,
    during the course of this study was probably in the order of several hundred kilometres.
    The routes walked were often the same, particularly in the more intensively studied
    areas. Attention was given to repeatedly observing particular species at certain
    locations, so that parameters such as the time of first flowering and first fruiting
    could be recorded for some of the rarer or more localized plant species, as well
    as the more common species. The author's field experience in the study areas prior
    to the fires was drawn upon to help locate particular species that might otherwise
    have been overlooked. (Some new ‘discoveries’ of species, previously unrecorded
    by the author, were made following the fires). The main references used for plant
    identification were Harden (1990–1993, 2002), Harden & Murray (2000), Carolin
    & Tindale (1994), Fairley & Moore (1989) and Robinson (1991).

locations:
  Lane Cove River catchment, Sydney:
    latitude (deg): -33.75
    longitude (deg): 151.08
    description: Clarke & Benson (1987) mapped and described 15 vegetation types,
      including mangrove forest, saltmarsh, tall forest, open-forest, woodland, shrubland
      and riparian shrubland for Lane Cove National Park (then known as Lane Cove
      River State Recreation Area). Most of the surviving bushland in the Lane Cove
      River area is sclerophyllous and occurs on sandstone geology, described in broad
      terms by Keith (2004) as the Sydney Coastal Dry Sclerophyll Forests.
    locality: northern Sydney metropolitan area
    geology (parent material): sandstone
    fire history: Generally, the study areas have experienced bushfires quite frequently
      in the recent past. However, there may be some patches of bushland within these
      catchments that escape being burnt for fairly long periods of time.
  Narrabeen Lagoon catchment, Sydney:
    latitude (deg): -33.71
    longitude (deg): 151.24
    description: The floristic diversity of the Narrabeen Lagoon catchment area is
      comparable to that of the Lane Cove River area. Sheringham & Sanders (1993)
      mapped and described 21 vegetation types in the eastern section of Garigal National
      Park (centred on Deep Creek) including areas of openforest, woodland, heathland,
      wetland, swamp and closedforest. Heathland is much more common at the Narrabeen
      Lagoon area than at Lane Cove River (see Benson & Howell 1990, 1994).
