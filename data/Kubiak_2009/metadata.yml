  description: A 6-year observational study of post-fire responses in the Lane Cove
    River and Narrabeen Lagoon catchment areas, following the 1994 fires.
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: adult
  measurement_remarks: notes
  sampling_strategy: Study areas ^p The Lane Cove River valley is situated in the
    northern Sydney metropolitan area (lat 33° 45' S, long 151° 05' E), in the Central
    Coast botanical subdivision of NSW. ^p The 1994 fires ^p The Lane Cove River fire
    began on 6 January 1994 in the Browns Waterhole area and was probably deliberately
    lit (NSW State Coroner 1995). The area of bushland burnt in the Lane Cove River
    catchment was variously estimated to be c. 383 ha (NSW NPWS 2002, DEC NSW 2005a,
    2006a) or c. 580 hectares (NSW State Coroner 1995, Gill & Moore 1998). The former
    estimate may possibly have been limited to bushland burnt in Lane Cove National
    Park, whilst the latter was for all bushland "affected" in the Lane Cove River
    area. The fires were generally described as being of a very high intensity (NSW
    State Coroner 1995). The fire in the Narrabeen Lagoon catchment area began on
    8 January 1994, having originated at Cottage Point on 7 January, and spread rapidly
    through the adjoining Ku-ringgai Chase National Park (NSW State Coroner 1995).
    On 8 January, and over the next few days, wildfire burnt through bushland in the
    Deep Creek, Mullet Creek, Middle Creek, Jamieson Park and Wheeler Creek areas.
    This fire event was estimated to have burnt c. 1000 ha in the eastern section
    (centred on Deep Creek) of Garigal National Park (DEC NSW 2005b, 2006b). Additional
    bushland in the Narrabeen Lagoon catchment area, outside of Garigal National Park,
    was also burnt. ^p Field observations ^p Field observations of fire responses
    of bushland plants were made in Lane Cove River catchment area between January
    1994 and October 1999 (a period of almost 6 years), with a few occasional observations
    in following years (Table 3). Field observations in the Narrabeen Lagoon catchment
    area, including any flowering or fruiting of plants, were made between March 1994
    and late October 1994 (over approximately 8 months). The longer period of study
    in the Lane Cove River area meant that more observations of postfire flowering
    and fruiting were made for plant species in that area, than in the Narrabeen Lagoon
    catchment. Observations were recorded while walking through burnt bushland after
    the fires. No fixed transects or quadrats were used. Observations were made along
    tracks, roads and walking trails throughout the study areas (Table 3). As wide
    a variety of habitats as possible were looked at, including bushland away from
    tracks and known to contain species or vegetation types that did not occur along
    the tracks. Most of the main tracks, and many of the minor ones, were walked at
    least once, and some, many times.. The total distance walked, while making observations,
    during the course of this study was probably in the order of several hundred kilometres.
    The routes walked were often the same, particularly in the more intensively studied
    areas. Attention was given to repeatedly observing particular species at certain
    locations, so that parameters such as the time of first flowering and first fruiting
    could be recorded for some of the rarer or more localized plant species, as well
    as the more common species. The author's field experience in the study areas prior
    to the fires was drawn upon to help locate particular species that might otherwise
    have been overlooked. (Some new 'discoveries' of species, previously unrecorded
    by the author, were made following the fires). The main references used for plant
    identification were Harden (1990-1993, 2002), Harden & Murray (2000), Carolin
    & Tindale (1994), Fairley & Moore (1989) and Robinson (1991).

locations:
  Lane Cove River catchment, Sydney:
    latitude (deg): -33.75
    longitude (deg): 151.08
    description: Clarke & Benson (1987) mapped and described 15 vegetation types,
      including mangrove forest, saltmarsh, tall forest, open-forest, woodland, shrubland
      and riparian shrubland for Lane Cove National Park (then known as Lane Cove
      River State Recreation Area). Most of the surviving bushland in the Lane Cove
      River area is sclerophyllous and occurs on sandstone geology, described in broad
      terms by Keith (2004) as the Sydney Coastal Dry Sclerophyll Forests.
    locality: northern Sydney metropolitan area
    geology (parent material): sandstone
    fire history: Generally, the study areas have experienced bushfires quite frequently
      in the recent past. However, there may be some patches of bushland within these
      catchments that escape being burnt for fairly long periods of time.
  Narrabeen Lagoon catchment, Sydney:
    latitude (deg): -33.71
    longitude (deg): 151.24
    description: The floristic diversity of the Narrabeen Lagoon catchment area is
      comparable to that of the Lane Cove River area. Sheringham & Sanders (1993)
      mapped and described 21 vegetation types in the eastern section of Garigal National
      Park (centred on Deep Creek) including areas of openforest, woodland, heathland,
      wetland, swamp and closedforest. Heathland is much more common at the Narrabeen
      Lagoon area than at Lane Cove River (see Benson & Howell 1990, 1994).

    were made in Lane Cove River catchment area between January 1994 and October 1999
    (a period of almost 6 years), with a few occasional observations in following

    & Tindale (1994), Fairley & Moore (1989) and Robinson (1991). ^p In the first
    few months following the fires, the main focus was on whether plant species in
    the study areas were killed by fire or had resprouted after being burnt. Sometimes
    the 'skeletons' of burnt plants could be found and, if these showed no sign of
    resprouting for some months after the fires, then this suggested that the plants
    were probably killed by fire. Such skeletons occasionally retained a few scorched
    leaves or fruits, which helped with the identification of the species killed by
    the fires. Areas that had evidently experienced the highest intensity fires tended
    to contain far fewer identifiable plant skeletons. In these situations, the presence
    of woody fruits, or cones, on fatally scorched plants helped with the identification
    of some species. In addition, it was often possible to recall that a species had
    occurred at a particular site prior to that location being burnt. If such a species
    appeared to be absent from that same site months after the fire, or was only present
    in the form of post-fire seedlings, then this also helped to decide whether that
    species was killed in the fires. Terrestrial orchids were amongst the most difficult
    plants to determine, as most of them were probably seasonally dormant at the time
    of the fires. Presumably, the terrestrial orchids mostly sprouted from dormant
    subterranean tubers after the fires (as discussed by Weston et al. 2005).

    Observations were recorded while walking through burnt bushland after the fires.
    No fixed transects or quadrats were used. Observations were made along tracks,
    roads and walking trails throughout the study areas (Table 3). As wide a variety
    of habitats as possible were looked at, including bushland away from tracks and
    known to contain species or vegetation types that did not occur along the tracks.
    Most of the main tracks, and many of the minor ones, were walked at least once,
    and some, many times. The total distance walked, while making observations, during
    the course of this study was probably in the order of several hundred kilometres.
    The routes walked were often the same, particularly in the more intensively studied
    areas. Attention was given to repeatedly observing particular species at certain
    locations, so that parameters such as the time of first flowering and first fruiting
    could be recorded for some of the rarer or more localized plant species, as well
    as the more common species. The author's field experience in the study areas prior
    to the fires was drawn upon to help locate particular species that might otherwise
    have been overlooked. (Some new 'discoveries' of species, previously unrecorded
    by the author, were made following the fires). The main references used for plant
    identification were Harden (1990-1993, 2002), Harden & Murray (2000), Carolin
    & Tindale (1994), Fairley & Moore (1989) and Robinson (1991). ^p Other data recorded,
    in the first few months after the fires, included the first appearance of some
    seedlings and the early post-fire flowering and fruiting of some plant species.
    As the months and years went by, the time to first flowering and fruiting was
    recorded for more species.

    roads and walking trails throughout the study areas (Table 3). As wide a variety
    of habitats as possible were looked at, including bushland away from tracks and
    known to contain species or vegetation types that did not occur along the tracks.
    Most of the main tracks, and many of the minor ones, were walked at least once,

    the course of this study was probably in the order of several hundred kilometres.
    The routes walked were often the same, particularly in the more intensively studied
    areas. Attention was given to repeatedly observing particular species at certain
    locations, so that parameters such as the time of first flowering and first fruiting
    could be recorded for some of the rarer or more localized plant species, as well
    as the more common species. The author's field experience in the study areas prior
    to the fires was drawn upon to help locate particular species that might otherwise
    have been overlooked. (Some new 'discoveries' of species, previously unrecorded
    by the author, were made following the fires). The main references used for plant
    identification were Harden (1990-1993, 2002), Harden & Murray (2000), Carolin
    & Tindale (1994), Fairley & Moore (1989) and Robinson (1991). ^p Other data recorded,
    in the first few months after the fires, included the first appearance of some
    seedlings and the early post-fire flowering and fruiting of some plant species.
    As the months and years went by, the time to first flowering and fruiting was

    of habitats as possible were looked at, including bushland away from tracks and
    known to contain species or vegetation types that did not occur along the tracks.
    Most of the main tracks, and many of the minor ones, were walked at least once,
    and some, many times. The total distance walked, while making observations, during
    the course of this study was probably in the order of several hundred kilometres.
    The routes walked were often the same, particularly in the more intensively studied
    areas. Attention was given to repeatedly observing particular species at certain
    locations, so that parameters such as the time of first flowering and first fruiting
    could be recorded for some of the rarer or more localized plant species, as well
    as the more common species. The author's field experience in the study areas prior
    to the fires was drawn upon to help locate particular species that might otherwise
    have been overlooked. (Some new 'discoveries' of species, previously unrecorded
    by the author, were made following the fires). The main references used for plant
    identification were Harden (1990-1993, 2002), Harden & Murray (2000), Carolin
    & Tindale (1994), Fairley & Moore (1989) and Robinson (1991). ^p Other data recorded,
    in the first few months after the fires, included the first appearance of some
    seedlings and the early post-fire flowering and fruiting of some plant species.
    As the months and years went by, the time to first flowering and fruiting was
    recorded for more species. The likely peaks of post-fire flowering or fruiting
    were also subjectively estimated for a few species. Such 'peaks' of post-fire
    flowering and fruiting may plateau over a number of years. These estimates are
    probably best regarded as broadly indicative as their estimation may have been
    affected by the subjective nature of the observations and by variability between
    and within populations. The rate of maturation tends to vary between individual
    plants, within any population of a given species (e.g. see Benson 1985).

    seedlings and the early post-fire flowering and fruiting of some plant species.
    As the months and years went by, the time to first flowering and fruiting was

    were also subjectively estimated for a few species. Such 'peaks' of post-fire
    flowering and fruiting may plateau over a number of years. These estimates are

    plants, within any population of a given species (e.g. see Benson 1985).

  methods: Field observations ^p Field observations of fire responses of bushland
    plants were made in Lane Cove River catchment area between January 1994 and October
    1999 (a period of almost 6 years), with a few occasional observations in following
    years (Table 3). Field observations in the Narrabeen Lagoon catchment area, including
    any flowering or fruiting of plants, were made between March 1994 and late October
    1994 (over approximately 8 months). The longer period of study in the Lane Cove
    River area meant that more observations of postfire flowering and fruiting were
    made for plant species in that area, than in the Narrabeen Lagoon catchment. ^p
    Observations were recorded while walking through burnt bushland after the fires.
    No fixed transects or quadrats were used. Observations were made along tracks,
    roads and walking trails throughout the study areas (Table 3). As wide a variety
    of habitats as possible were looked at, including bushland away from tracks and
    known to contain species or vegetation types that did not occur along the tracks.
    Most of the main tracks, and many of the minor ones, were walked at least once,
    and some, many times. The total distance walked, while making observations, during
    the course of this study was probably in the order of several hundred kilometres.
    The routes walked were often the same, particularly in the more intensively studied
    areas. Attention was given to repeatedly observing particular species at certain
    locations, so that parameters such as the time of first flowering and first fruiting
    could be recorded for some of the rarer or more localized plant species, as well
    as the more common species. The author's field experience in the study areas prior
    to the fires was drawn upon to help locate particular species that might otherwise

    observations in the Narrabeen Lagoon catchment area, including any flowering or
    fruiting of plants, were made between March 1994 and late October 1994 (over approximately
    8 months). The longer period of study in the Lane Cove River area meant that more
    observations of postfire flowering and fruiting were made for plant species in
    that area, than in the Narrabeen Lagoon catchment. ^p Observations were recorded
    while walking through burnt bushland after the fires. No fixed transects or quadrats
    were used. Observations were made along tracks, roads and walking trails throughout
    the study areas (Table 3). As wide a variety of habitats as possible were looked
    at, including bushland away from tracks and known to contain species or vegetation
    types that did not occur along the tracks. Most of the main tracks, and many of
    the minor ones, were walked at least once, and some, many times. The total distance
    walked, while making observations, during the course of this study was probably
    in the order of several hundred kilometres. The routes walked were often the same,
    particularly in the more intensively studied areas. Attention was given to repeatedly
    observing particular species at certain locations, so that parameters such as
    the time of first flowering and first fruiting could be recorded for some of the
    rarer or more localized plant species, as well as the more common species. The
    author's field experience in the study areas prior to the fires was drawn upon
    to help locate particular species that might otherwise have been overlooked. (Some
    new 'discoveries' of species, previously unrecorded by the author, were made following
    the fires). The main references used for plant identification were Harden (1990-1993,
    2002), Harden & Murray (2000), Carolin & Tindale (1994), Fairley & Moore (1989)
    and Robinson (1991). ^p Other data recorded, in the first few months after the
    fires, included the first appearance of some seedlings and the early post-fire
    flowering and fruiting of some plant species. As the months and years went by,
    the time to first flowering and fruiting was recorded for more species.
