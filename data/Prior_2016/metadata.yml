  description: The aims of the present study were to (1) quantify the stem and whole-plant
    mortality of acacia, eucalypt and other tree species following canopy-defoliating
    fire in dry eucalypt forest and woodland in the Tasmanian Midlands; (2) examine
    the extent of seedling establishment and resprouting in eucalypts and acacias,
    the most dominant tree genera in the region; and (3) compare fuel loads in burnt
    and nearby unburnt transects.

  sampling_strategy: A series of canopy-defoliating fires in February 2009, February
    2011, February 2012 and January 2013 afforded the opportunity to document fire
    effects in remnant dry eucalypt forest in the northern part of the Midlands. We
    did this by comparing 14 recently burnt and 20 long-unburnt sites. At each site,
    we established a plot 100 m long and 20 m wide, from which we collected data on
    tree size, density and species composition.

  methods: We recorded the status of each individual as "alive" no epicormics (if
    the main stem had live foliage), "epicormically resprouting" (main stem with live
    epicormic resprouts), "basally resprouting" (main stem dead but live basal resprouts
    present) or "dead" (main stem dead and no live resprouts). For analyses of survival,
    "live stems" included those with live epicormic resprouts, and "live whole plants"
    included those with live epicormic or basal resprouts.

    "live stems" included those with live epicormic resprouts, and "live whole plants"
    included those with live epicormic or basal resprouts. The methods used could
    overestimate the proportion of eucalypts resprouting, because many dead stems
    could not be identified to species level.
