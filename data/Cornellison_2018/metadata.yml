    title: 'Global herbivory: how much plant tissue do insects eat?'
people:
- name: Mark Ooi
  institution: University of New South Wales
  role: collector, contact
dataset:
  year_collected_start: 2018
  year_collected_end: 2018
  description: The purpose of the study is to evaluate the levels of herbivory worldwide
    using a standardised protocol.
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: The site was selected based on needing an area with at least
    5 co-occurring species with varying leaf forms.
  original_file: Leaf herbivory datasheet_Mark Ooi_Sydney.xlsx with two sheets 'Herbivory'
    and 'Other data'. Data from both sheets combined using custom r code.
  notes: Paper in review.
