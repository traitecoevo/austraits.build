  description: Samples of recently produced shoot material collected in winter/spring
    from common plant species of mulga vegetation in eastern and Western Australia
    were assayed for 13C and 15N natural abundance.
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: unknown
  sampling_strategy: Plant material from the eastern and western sites was sampled
    in July to September of 1994 and 1995, when ephemeral ground cover was at peak
    biomass and most perennial species were resuming active growth following wetting
    of soil by winter rains. Each site, including the dune at Lake Mongers, Western
    Australia, was first surveyed floristically to establish which common species
    collectively comprised 80% or more of the standing plant biomass, represented,
    respectively, by life and growth types comprising herbaceous winter (wet season)
    ephemerals, herbaceous perennials, woody shrubs and trees. Pooled samples of shoot
    biomass were then harvested from 30 to 40 different individual plants of the common
    higher plant taxa identified for each of the above categories. Whole shoots were
    collected from winter active ephemerals, whereas harvests were restricted to recently
    extended leafy shoot material of herbaceous perennial, woody shrub and tree species.
    All material was oven-dried at 60-80 °C.

  methods: Oven-dried  samples  of  plant  and  animal  material  wereground  to  a  fine  powder  in  a  vibratory  ball  mill  (RetschMM-2, Haan, Germany). δ15N analyses were conducted on the  ammonia  recovered  by  steam  distillation  of  Kjeldahldigests. The distillate (50 cm3) of each digest was reducedto ≈1cm3volume  using  a  microwave  oven  and  the(NH4)2S04converted  to  N2by  on-line  oxidation  withsodium  hypobromite  (Unkovich  et al.  1993).  The  isotopeanalyses  were  performed  on  a  dual  inlet,  triple  collectormass  spectrometer  (VG  Isogas,  SIRA 9,  Cheshire,  UK).Analytical procedures and the potential errors of measure-ment involved in each were as detailed by Unkovich et al.(1993).  The  compounded  error  of  measurement  of  δ15Nbetween  assays  on  replicate  samples  of  plant  materialwas ± 0·2‰ (SD).δ13C analyses of matching replicates of all plant materialwere  conducted  in  Perth  (Western  Australian  material)using  the  VG  Isogas  SIRA9  following  combustion  of1–1·5 mg samples of dry matter in an Isoprep 13 apparatus(VG, Isogas). 13C/12C ratios of the resulting CO2were thencompared with that obtained by combustion of a hydrocar-bon δ13C  standard,  NBS-22.  Precision  of  measurementbased  on  triplicate  assays  of  a  single  dry  matter  samplewas   ±   0·11‰   (SD).   Comparable   δ13C   analyses   ofQueensland material were carried out using an automated15N/13C  analyser:mass  spectrometer  (ANCA-MS,  EuropaScientific,  Crewe,  UK).  The  precision  of  measurementbased on multiple analyses of a standard plant dry mattersample (leaves of Eucalyptus crebra) was 0·21‰ (SD).
