  description: Samples of recently produced shoot material collected in winter/spring
    from common plant species of mulga vegetation in eastern and Western Australia
    were assayed for 13C and 15N natural abundance.
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: unknown
  sampling_strategy: Plant material from the eastern and western sites was sampled
    in July to September of 1994 and 1995, when ephemeral ground cover was at peak
    biomass and most perennial species were resuming active growth following wetting
    of soil by winter rains. Each site, including the dune at Lake Mongers, Western
    Australia, was first surveyed floristically to establish which common species
    collectively comprised 80% or more of the standing plant biomass, represented,
    respectively, by life and growth types comprising herbaceous winter (wet season)
    ephemerals, herbaceous perennials, woody shrubs and trees. Pooled samples of shoot
    biomass were then harvested from 30 to 40 different individual plants of the common
    higher plant taxa identified for each of the above categories. Whole shoots were
    collected from winter active ephemerals, whereas harvests were restricted to recently
    extended leafy shoot material of herbaceous perennial, woody shrub and tree species.
    All material was oven-dried at 60-80 °C.

locations:
  Eastern mulga:
    latitude (deg): -28.85
    longitude (deg): 144.5
    description: The Queensland site was within Currawinya National Park 100km west
      of Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. The site comprised mulga vegetation typical
      of the eastern biogeographic region.
    precipitation, MAP (mm): 294
  Western mulga:
    latitude (deg): -28.893333
    longitude (deg): 117.129167
    description: The Western Australia site was in Thundelarra Station around 500km
      north of Perth and in the Murchison Region of Western Australia. The site was
      equivalently representative mulga flora of the western counterpart.
    precipitation, MAP (mm): 262
  Lake Mongers:
    latitude (deg): -28.893333
    longitude (deg): 117.129167
    description: A special study was also undertaken on the vegetation on a 500m long,
      5m high dune of wind-blown sand on a southern shore of Lake Mongers, Western
      Australia, 15km south of the main sampling site at Thundelarra. While containing
      mostly the same species as the surrounding soft mulga, the open-textured, heavily
      leached sands of the dune were clearly highly atypical of mulga generally within
      the region.

  entity_type: population

  basis_of_value: measurement
  replicates: unknown
  methods: Oven-dried samples of plant and animal material were ground to a fine powder
    in a vibratory ball mill (RetschMM-2, Haan, Germany). Delta15N analyses were conducted
    on the ammonia recovered by steam distillation of Kjeldahl digests. The distillate
    (50 cm3) of each digest was reduced to ≈1cm3 volume using a microwave oven and
    the (NH4)2S04 converted to N2 by online oxidation with sodium hypobromite (Unkovich
    et al. 1993). The isotope analyses were performed on a dual inlet, triple collectormass
    spectrometer (VG Isogas, SIRA 9, Cheshire, UK). Analytical procedures and the
    potential errors of measurement involved in each were as detailed by Unkovich
    et al.(1993). The compounded error of measurement of delta15N between assays on
    replicate samples of plant material was <U+00B1> permille (SD). Delta13C analyses
    of matching replicates of all plant material were conducted in Perth (Western
    Australian material) using the VG Isogas SIRA9 following combustion of 1-1.5 mg
    samples of dry matter in an Isoprep 13 apparatus (VG, Isogas). 13C/12C ratios
    of the resulting CO2 were then compared with that obtained by combustion of a
    hydrocarbon delta13C standard, NBS-22.
