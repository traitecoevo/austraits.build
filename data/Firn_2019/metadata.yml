  description: In a global experimental test, we quantified how leaf traits in grasslands
    change in response to the addition of soil nutrients (that is, nitrogen, phosphorus
    and potassium) and the exclusion of vertebrate herbivores.
  collection_type: field_experiment
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: The 27 study sites (four located in Australia and included into
    AusTraits) are part of NutNet- a cooperative globally distributed experiment (Fig.
    1 and Supplementary Table 1; http://www.nutnet.org/). Each experimental site had
    a randomized block design, and at most sites, 3 replicate blocks divided into
    10 5-m x 5-m plots were established, resulting in a total of 30 plots per site.
    In this experiment, we established a set of nutrient addition treatments that
    included a full factorial combination of three essential plant macronutrients
    (nitrogen, phosphorus and K), including a control. The vertebrate herbivore exclusion
    treatment was established by fencing two plots within each of the blocks. For
    each species selected for leaf trait analysis in each plot, we randomly selected
    five fully developed leaves with little to no signs of herbivore damage from five
    mature individuals. Sampling followed the standardized protocols detailed by Cornelissen
    et al.24. Under sites, the variable temperature variation is a measure of seasonality
    calculated as the standard deviation x 100) and precipitation variation is a measure
    of seasonality calculated as the coefficient of variation. The nitrogen and phosphorus
    values reported for each site are the mean of the control plots at this site.
    Values for the nutrient addition plots are given in the

  methods: Leaf percent by mass nitrogen. Dried leaves were then ground, bulked per
    plot and per species, and analysed for leaf nutrient concentrations. The leaf
    nitrogen content was determined using a LECO TruMac, which is based on a combustion
    technique that uses thermal conductivity relative to pure gas. This is considered
    accurate to within 1%.

- var_in: SLA_v2
  unit_in: mm2/g
  trait_name: specific_leaf_area
  value_type: site_mean
  replicates: 5
  methods: SLA calculated by dividing leaf area/ leaf dry mass. For each species selected
    for leaf trait analysis in each plot, we randomly selected five fully developed
    leaves with little to no signs of herbivore damage from five mature individuals.
    Sampling followed the standardized protocols detailed by Cornelissen et al.24.
    All leaves from each species in each plot were combined to measure leaf area.
    Depending on the resources available at each site, leaf area (mm2) was measured
    using various leaf area meters or using a flatbed scanner (Epson perfection V300)
    and the image analysis software ImageJ40. Thereafter, all leaves were dried at
    60 deg C for 48h and then weighed (dry weight; g). SLA was calculated as the leaf
    area divided by the dry weight. SLA was calculated for all five leaves collected
    from each species in each plot at every site.
