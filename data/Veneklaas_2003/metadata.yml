  description: Trait data from a Banksia woodland north of Perth
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: The woodland community studied (Appendix A) is located at 31
    deg 41'42'' S 115deg 55' 18'' E, in the centre of the Melaleuca Park Conservation
    Area. It had not experienced fire for approximately 12 years (L. Mutter, pers.
    comm.) The vegetation has a very open canopy dominated by the trees Banksia attenuata
    and B. menziesii (refer to Appendix A for authorities and families). Other canopy
    species are Adenanthos cygnorum (a tall shrub) and Nuytsia floribunda (a tree
    hemiparasite). Xanthorrhoea preissii (a stem rosette with long narrow leaves,
    usually unbranched) and Macrozamia riedlei (a cycad, short stems but long palm-like
    leaves) are medium-sized. The understorey consists of many long-lived woody shrubs
    and some perennial herbs. During winter and spring, some wet season herbaceous
    species appear. Even then, however, about 20% of the soil is without plant cover.
    All trees and shrubs retain foliage during the dry summer season, in fact, many
    of the species produce new foliage in spring and early summer. Only fire decreases
    foliage density radically, but due to the predominance of species with resprouting
    capacity (Pate and Bell, 1999), this is restored relatively quickly. Ecological
    attributes of most of the species were documented in previous studies of Banksia
    woodland (Dodd and Bell, 1993a,b; Dodd et al., 1984; Pate and Bell, 1999). Using
    these sources, rooting depth (deep, > 2 m, or shallow, < 2 m) could be established
    for all but three of the species studied by us (Appendix A). The climate of the
    region is typically Mediterranean, with wet and cool winters and dry and hot summers.
    Mean annual rainfall for the site is 810 mm (Bureau of Meteorology, Perth; interpolated
    from nearby stations), 80% of which falls between May and September, and only
    4% during the summer months of December to February. Summer rainfall is unpredictable
    and normally associated with tropical cyclone activity. Pan evaporation is very
    high in summer (on average close to 10 mm day-1) but five times less in winter,
    due to lower temperatures, higher air humidity, lower radiation loads and somewhat
    lower windspeeds. Deep oligotrophic coarse sands of low waterholding capacity
    underlie the Banksia woodland. These are highly weathered aeolic deposits of the
    Bassendean formation (McArthur, 1991), which contain an unconfined aquifer with
    a depth to groundwater of 2 to >10 m below the surface, depending on landscape
    position. Water table depth varies with a seasonal amplitude of 0.5-1 m (Water
    and Rivers Commission, East Perth, unpublished data; see also section below).  Physiological
    measurements were carried out on 25 representative species, every second month
    between March 1999 and March 2000. A further five wintergreen herbaceous species
    were measured in July 1999. All measurements were taken between 08:00 and 11:00
    local time, spread over 3 days. For each species, we selected one sample each
    from six replicate plants. Samples consisted of leaves or, when these were very
    small, groups of leaves on short stem sections. All leaves were fully mature leaves
    located at the outside of the plant crown.

  methods: Timing of shoot growth and leaf longevity were estimated through phenological
    observations on six occasions during the year. Four branches on three plants per
    species were tagged. Growth (elongation of stems or new branches above the tag)
    and leaf death/shedding were quantified. Based on these records and, in many species,
    clearly distinctive annual cohorts, the mean leaf life span was estimated from
    the mean number of cohorts present. For species where this method was not practical,
    e.g., the single-stemmed Xanthorrhoea preissii and Macrozamia riedlei, and the
    clonal perennial herbs Lyginia barbata and Patersonia occidentalis, an assessment
    of leaf turnover was made by measuring the lengths of leaves that died or were
    produced during one year, and comparing that with the total length of living leaves
    present.
