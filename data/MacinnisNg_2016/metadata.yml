  sampling_strategy: 2.1. STUDY SITE AND SPECIES The study sites were located near
    Crookwell, an agricultural and pastoral district in the southern Tablelands of
    New South Wales (34.4572 S, 149.4690 E, elevation 887 m). All sites had open forest
    with a grass understorey and very few shrubs and were within 3 km of each other.
    Site 1 at Laggan Corner was dominated by Eucalyptus dives Schauer (peppermint)
    directly adjacent to a saline scald, where salt crystals were forming on the soil
    surface and vegetation was absent due to the high concentrations of salt. Site
    2 (also at Laggan Corner) was dominated by Eucalyptus rossii R. Baker & HG Smith
    (scribbly gum) and was 300mfrom the nearest visible saline scald. Eucalyptus macrorhyncha
    F. Muell. ex Benth (red stringybark) occurred at both sites 1 and 2 as did E.
    rossii. Sites 3 and 4 at Laggan Dam were equally dominated by Eucalyptus goniocalyx
    F. Muell. ex Miq. (box), E. macrorhyncha and E. dives. Site 3 was directly adjacent
    to a saline scald while site 4 was over 200 m from the saline scald. Trees closest
    to the saline scald appeared unhealthy with discoloured leaves. Winter sampling
    took place in July 2003 and summer sampling occurred in January 2004. E. macrorhyncha
    was studied at all four sites. E. rossii and E. goniocalyx were also studied at
    Laggan corner and Laggan dam respectively but data are not shown because these
    data were very similar to those for E. macrorhyncha. Red stringybark is wide-spread
    in south-eastern NSW and locally dominant in dry schlerophyll forests and woodlands.
    It is hardy, tolerating frosts and occasional snow (Boland et al., 2006). Six
    sample trees were identified within two plots at each site (three trees per plot).
    All plant measurements were conducted on these trees. Leaf and branch samples
    were selected haphazardly from within 5 m of the ground. This research was conducted
    during a prolonged and extreme drought lasting three years, with severe water
    deficiencies with rainfalls in the lowest 5% of historical totals (Bureau of Meteorology,
    2003). The region is characterised by a long-term mean annual rainfall of 861
    mm but is located in a rain shadow so the sites commonly experience drought conditions
    with extended periods (months to years) with little rainfall. There is slightly
    more rain in winter than summer and average temperatures are 10-27 deg C in summer
    and 0-10 deg C in winter (Fig. 1). Climate data were obtained from the nearest
    Bureau of Meteorology station at Crookwell Post Office (approximately 8 km to
    the south of the experimental sites). 2.2. SOIL SALINITY AND WATER CONTENT The
    soil is defined as coarsely cracking grey and brown clays (NSW Natural Resource
    Atlas, http://nratlas.nsw.gov.au, accessed on 22nd July 2013). The soil type is
    a sodosol (Isbell, 2002) and is classed as sodic saline soil according to Rengasamy's
    (2010) categories. Particle size analysis indicated the clay content was approximately
    30%. Five soil samples were collected from the base of each of the six sap flow
    sample trees to assess salt content of the soil at each of the four sites. Approximately
    1000 cm3 were excavated at a depth of 10 cm and transported in a zip-lock bag
    to the laboratory. An aqueous saturated paste extract (of 50 mL water to 10 g
    air-dried soil) was produced by shaking the sample for 5 min then allowing to
    settle for an hour, following the methods of Rhoades (1982). The electrical conductivity
    (dS cm -1) of this solution was measured with a conductivity meter (YSI Incorporated,
    Ohio) and divided by 100 to produce values of dS m_1. The salinity of the saturated
    paste extractwas multiplied by 8.6 (for a sandy clay loam) to determine the salinity
    experienced by roots (Taws, 2003). The remaining soil was dried to constant weight
    (110 deg C) and weighed to determine soil water content. As our sites were privately
    owned, we did not have permission to dig deep holes so we were limited to non-invasive
    soil measurements in this project.

  methods: Huber values (Hv) were calculated as the branch transverse area per leaf
    area distal to the cut such that Hv = SA/LA where SA is the cross-sectional area
    of the sapwood of the branch and LA is the leaf area supported by that section
    of branch. The diameter of the basal end of each branch was measured using a micrometer
    and the length of each branch was measured with a ruler. Leaf area was determined
    using a WinDIAS (Type WDIGC-2 Delta-T Devices Ltd, U.K) leaf area meter. Sapwood
    cross-sectional area was determined by soaking thin sections of branch in 0.5%
    toluidine blue solution. The stained sapwood area was measured with a calibrated
    eyepiece micrometer.

  methods: Hydraulic conductance was determined by the method described by Prior and
    Eamus (2000). Branches were collected before 0900 hours to avoid the diurnal period
    of most stress. Two terminal branches (no less than 3 times as long as the longest
    vessel) were cut under water for each of three plants in each of the two plots,
    for the determination of hydraulic conductance. These branches were placed upright
    in a container of water and covered with a black plastic bag to reduce transpiration
    during the 60-90-min trip to the laboratory. Once in the laboratory all leaves
    and petioles were removed under water with a razor blade. Basal and distal ends
    of the branch were both re-cut under water. Branches were then connected to graduated
    1-mL pipettes via tubing filled with degassed, filtered (0.22 um), acidified (pH
    2, HCl; Sperry et al. 1994) water. Hydraulic conductance was determined using
    two vacuum systems approximately 2 m long and 30 cm wide, each of which could
    accommodate three branches. The solution was pulled through the branch in the
    normal direction of the transpiration stream by applying a vacuum to the chamber.
    Flow rate of the acidified de-gassed water was measured at four levels of vacuum
    (pressure difference (delta P) = 20, 30, 40 and 50 kPa), which was measured with
    a vacuum gauge (Leybold, Germany). Branches were allowed to reach an equilibrium
    flow rate before flow rate was recorded. Hydraulic conductance (kg s-1 MPa-1)
    was calculated as the slope of the relationship between flow rate and pressure
    difference using linear regression. Hydraulic conductivity (kg s-1 m MPa-1) was
    calculated by multiplying the conductance by the branch length and was expressed
    in terms of leaf area, sapwood area and branch transverse area.

  methods: Photosynthesis was measured as maximum (light saturated) assimilation (Amax)
    with a HCM-1000 Portable Photosynthesis System (PPS) (Walz, Germany). Measurements
    were taken in the morning (between 0930 and 1130) and in the afternoon (between
    1400 and 1600), to avoid any effects of midday  own-regulation. The PPS is often
    used in the field to measure leaves still attached to plants (McPherson et al.,
    2004) but due to the height of leaves on the eucalypts in this study, small branches
    were cut off the trees with a long-armed pruner and placed in water. These branches
    were re-cut underwater and placed under three 50 W halogen lamps delivering approximately
    600 mmol photons m-2 sec-1 at leaf height, standardising light conditions. Preliminary
    investigations showed that removal of branches from the tree did not cause a significant
    change in the rate of photosynthesis over a 45 min period (data not shown). Measurements
    were taken at ambient temperature, humidity and atmospheric CO2 concentrations.
    The PPS was operated in differential mode with a 5 cm2 closed cuvette, with a
    2 mm fibre optic cable inserted through the cuvette lid for fluorescence measurements.
    Once the CO2 differential had stabilised, Amax (defined as the rate of carbon
    fixation per unit of leaf under saturating light conditions) was measured. Assimilation
    rate was measured on three leaves on three plants in each plot, with two plots
    at each site (a total of 18 samples per site).

    laboratory. Five 1 cm2 leaf discs were cut with a cork borer and dried at 70 deg
    C until constant weight (usually 5 days). Each discwas weighed to four decimal
    places and the specific leaf area (SLA) was calculated as the ratio of area to
    dry mass of the disc.

  contributor: You'll notice that the values for leaf_specific_conductivity seem about
