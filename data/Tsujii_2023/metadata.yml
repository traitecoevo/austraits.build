  description: Study to understand how whether leaf P fractions (orthophosphate P,
    Pi; metabolite P, PM; nucleic acid P, PN; lipid P, PL; and residual P, PR) are
    correlated with leaf economic traits in 35 Australian woody species growing under
    different disturbance regimes and in soils with different P contents.
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: Three sites were selected within 30 km of each other in Sydney,
    NSW, Australia (Table 1). This region comprises P-impoverished soils across geologically
    ancient stable landscapes (Kooyman et al., 2017). Two sites were in Kuring-gai
    Chase National Park, where native vegetation is preserved on sandstone-derived
    and basalt-derived soils (33°34'S, 151°17'E and 33°41'S, 151°08'E, respectively,
    c. 150 m above sea level). The concentration of total soil P (total soil [P],
    0-15 cm depth) was 94 and 442 ug P g-1 dry mass in the sandstone soil and the
    basalt soil, respectively (Wright et al., 2001). These values are much lower than
    or similar to the global average (570 ug g-1 dry mass; He et al., 2021). Hereafter,
    we describe the sandstone site and the basalt site as 'low-P' site and 'high-P'
    site, respectively. The third site - previously used by Tsujii et al. (2023) for
    studying leaf P fractions - was in the Macquarie University Ecology Reserve (33°77'S,
    151°12'E, c. 50 m above sea level), itself a part of Lane Cove National Park,
    which included a native vegetation on sandstone-derived soil, with human disturbances
    including bush walking and P input through stormwater run-off after significant
    rain from the nearby sports field (Leishman & Thomson, 2005). Hereafter, this
    site is described as a 'disturbed' site. This site had similar total soil [P]
    as the low-P site (78 ug P g-1 dry mass, 0-15 cm depth; Tsujii et al., 2023);
    however, the concentration of soluble soil P (soluble soil [P]; Bray-1 extraction)
    was higher (6.6 ug P g-1 dry mass, 0-15 cm depth; Tsujii et al., 2023) than at
    the low-P and high-P sites (1.2 and 3.4 ug P g-1; O. Butler, unpublished). Mean
    daily maximum and minimum temperature and annual precipitation were similar across
    these three sites, 22.0 and 13.0°C and 1220 mm yr-1 at the low-P and high-P sites;
    (Wright et al., 2001); and 22.8 and 11.4°C and 1126 mm yr-1 at the disturbed site
    (Bureau of Meteorology, Australian Government; www.bom.gov.au/climate/data/).

  methods: Gas exchange measurements were performed using branch samples in parallel
    with leaf sampling (November-December 2019). Approximately 1 m-long branches were
    cut with pruning shears from 2-6 mature individuals per species (one branch per
    individual; on average 3.5 individuals per species) in the early morning (c. 6-8
    am during daylight-saving time) to avoid high daytime air temperatures. The proximal
    ends of sampled branches were re-cut under tap water in a bucket and transported
    to the laboratory at Macquarie University. A Li-Cor LI-6800 portable photosynthesis
    system (LICOR, Lincoln, NE, United States) was used to measure light-saturated
    net photosynthesis and dark respiration. Aarea was measured under 1800 µmol m-2
    s-1 of photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD), with reference to a recent continental-scale
    study across Australia (Westerband et al. 2022).

  replicates: '5'
  methods: Leaf censuses were conducted to estimate LL for five individuals per species
    following the procedure of Wright et al. (2002). The individuals used for the
    LL monitoring did not always correspond to those for the LMA measurement or chemical
    analyses. Five age-sequences of leaves were randomly selected per individual in
    late 2019 (in total 25 sequences per species). For Acacia longifolia, in total
    25 branches were chosen across six individuals due to the limited replications
    within individuals. The number of leaves was counted along the sequence of leaf
    age from the youngest leaf (>25% expanded) on the shoot top to the oldest leaf
    on the same or older ordered branch, or sometimes on the stem. On average, 178
    leaves were counted per sequence (13-772 leaves per sequence). Wires with plastic
    tags were used to mark each branch (or stem). Six months later, the remaining
    leaves on the same branch or stem were counted and new sequences with newly-expanded
    leaves were marked. This census was repeated six months later (i.e. the total
    monitoring period was 1 year). The leaf census of D. triquetra was conducted every
    three months because of short LL (often less than six months). LL was defined
    as the inverse of leaf turnover rate. We estimated average LL across the two census
    periods. Leaf turnover rate during each census period was calculated - see manuscript
    for equation.

  methods: Fully expanded, healthy outer-canopy leaves (or phyllodes for Acacia species)
    were sampled from three to five individuals of dominant evergreen species during
    summer (Nov 2019-Mar 2020). Eleven, 15 and 12 species were selected at the low-P,
    the high-P, and the disturbed sites, respectively. The list of sampled species
    can be found in Fig. 1. All leaf trait data from the disturbed site were published
    in Tsujii et al. (2023). Sampled leaves were snap-frozen with liquid nitrogen
    in the field, freeze-dried, and powdered in a wire mill (mesh size 0.08 mm; Retsch
    ZM200, Haan, Germany) before chemical analyses. One to 84 leaves per individual
    (on average 11 leaves) were also sampled and scanned on a flat-bed scanner (CanoScan
    LiDE220; Canon, Tokyo, Japan). Areas of the scanned leaves were determined using
    the image analysis software (ImageJ; US National Institutes of Health, Bethesda,
    MD, USA). Scanned leaves were oven-dried at 60°C for 48 h, and dry mass was determined
    to calculate LMA. The area of needle leaves was adjusted by pi/2 on the assumption
    of circular cross sections (Wright & Westoby, 2002).

  methods: Fully expanded outer-canopy leaves (or phyllodes for Acacia longifolia)
    were sampled from five individuals of each species during early summer (November-December
    2019). Hereafter, these sampled leaves are described as green leaves. We randomly
    sampled healthy leaves from several branches. Green leaves included newly-expanded
    leaves (100% expanded) and leaves produced in the previous year or before. Green
    leaves were snap-frozen in liquid N2 in the field and brought back to the laboratory
    at Macquarie University. The samples were freeze-dried and powdered in a wire
    mill (mesh size 0.08 mm, Retsch ZM200, Haan, Germany) prior to chemical analyses.
    Recently senesced leaves of the same trees were sampled by shaking the trees (leaves
    with a fully formed abscission layer easily detached). Senesced leaf samples were
    oven-dried at 60 °C for 48 h and powdered in the same manner.

    and divided into five fractions (i.e. Pi, PM, PN, PL, and PR) following the methodology
    from Chapin & Kedrowski (1983), with modifications (Yan et al., 2019). For the
    Pi assay, interfering substrates were removed by filtration through activated
    charcoal (Dayrell et al., 2022). The detailed methodology of P-fractionation analyses
    is provided in Supporting Information Methods S1 and S2. We accepted data with
    90-110% in recovery rate, that is the percentage of the sum of P concentrations
    in the fractions per [Ptotal].

  methods: Gas exchange measurements were performed using branch samples in parallel

    to the laboratory at Macquarie University. A Li-Cor LI-6800 portable photosynthesis
    system (LICOR, Lincoln, NE, United States) was used to measure light-saturated
    net photosynthesis and dark respiration. Dark respiration rate per unit area (Rdarea)
    was recorded once gas exchange became stable after the light in the photosynthetic
    chamber was turned off (i.e. PPFD = 0 µmol m-2 s-1). The time for dark acclimation
    was c. 5-30 min. Stomatal conductance to water vapour (gsw) and internal CO2 concentration
    in leaves (Ci) were recorded to estimate carboxylation capacity (see the following
    section). Leaf temperature and CO2 concentration in the chamber were kept at 25
    °C and 400 µmol mol-1, respectively. LMA was used to convert area-basis rates
    to mass-basis rates (i.e. Amass and Rdmass). Arithmetic means by species (hereafter,
    species means) were used for this calculation because the individuals used for
    the gas exchange measurements often differed from those for the following LMA
    measurements (also from those for LL monitoring or leaf P and N analyses). Therefore,
    we did not have within-species error estimates for Amass and Rdmass.
