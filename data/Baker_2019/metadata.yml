  description: Post-fire fire-response surveys on the NSW north coast
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: 'The study was undertaken in open-forest communities at five
    locations: Bogangar (28deg 19min 49.3sec S 153deg 33min 07.0sec E); Main Arm (28deg
    29min 38.299sec S 153deg 23min 33.9sec E); Broken Head (28deg 44min 35.339sec
    S 153deg 36min 3.479sec E); Midgen Flat (28deg 45min 05.7sec S 153deg 35min 03.0sec
    E) and East Ballina (28deg 51min 33.75sec S 153deg 35min 18.6sec E) on the north
    coast of New South Wales. Locations were selected for sampling that had been burnt
    between 6-12 months prior to survey. At each site, random meander searches (~60
    min, 500m) were undertaken for rainforest plants that had been completely top-killed
    by the recent fire (main stem charred and dead).  Encountered dead stems were
    also identified to species using scorched foliage, bark and habit to allow calculation
    of percent mortality. Species were assigned to a fire response class as follows:
    ''resprout'' = vigorous resprouting was observed in >30% of top-killed stems (Gill
    & Bradstock 1992); and ''seed'' = 50 or more seedlings were observed. At least
    5 seedlings, of each recorded species were carefully checked to ensure that seedlings
    were not shoots arising from root suckers. Examples of each recorded species were
    photographed. Gill, A.M.; Bradstock, R.A. 1992. A national register for the fire
    responses of plant species. Cunninghamia. 1992; 2(4):653-660.'
