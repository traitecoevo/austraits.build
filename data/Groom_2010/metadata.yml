  description: 'Phosphorus accumulation in Proteaceae seeds: a synthesis - A reanalysis
    of values from the literature'
  basis_of_record: literature
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: Study compares seed P and seed P recycling in Proteaceae species
    in southwestern Australia and South Africa to address the following questions,
    1. How much shoot and reproductive-structure P is allocated to seeds and what
    affects the levels? 2. How much P is stored in individual seeds and how does seed
    P vary with seed size, fire response, level of serotiny, and region? 3. What is
    the form of P in seeds? 4. Do the data support the hypothesis that P is a limiting
    resource in these regions? The study uses values from the literature to address
    these questions. Values are used from, Denton et al. (2007) (data in AusTraits
    under Denton_2007), Kuo et al. (1982) (data in AusTraits under Kuo_1982), Milberg
    et al. (1998) (data in AusTraits under Milberg_1998), Stock et al. (1989) (doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8137.1991.tb00950.x),
    Hocking (1986) (data in AusTraits under Hocking_1986), Hocking (1982) (data in
    AusTraits under Hocking_1982), Milberg and Lamont (1997) (data in AusTraits under
    Milberg_1997), Groom and Lamont (2004), Lamont and Groom (2002) (doi.org/10.1111/nph.13465;
    data in AusTraits under Lamont_2002), and Pate et al. (1986) (doi.org/10.1093/oxfordjournals.aob.a087159)
  original_file: none - extracted data from manuscript
  notes: Values derived from Denton_2007, Kuo_1982, Milberg_1998, Milberg_1997, Hocking_1986,
    and Hocking_1982 have been filtered out, since they are in AusTraits under their
    primary references; these duplicate values are still present in the data.csv file.
