  sampling_strategy: 'Study compares seed P and seed P recycling in Proteceae species
    in southwest Australia and South Africa at address the following questions: Our
    review addresses the following questions: 1. How much shoot and reproductive structure
    P is allocated to seeds and what affects the levels? 2. How much P is stored in
    individual seeds and how does seed P vary with seed size, fire response, level
    of serotiny, and region? 3. What is the form of P in seeds? 4. Do the data support
    the hypothesis that P is a limiting resource in these regions? The study uses
    values from the literature to address these questions'

  southwest Australia:
    description: SWA's (southwest Australia) climate varies from almost uniformly
      moist to extra-dry mediterranean largely resulting from a long western coastline
      covering 10.5 deg of latitude (Table 1), and a landscape that lacks significant
      topographical variation except in a few prominent ranges (Hopkins et al. 1983;
      Hopper and Gioia 2004). Deep sands and lateritic rock over leached clay have
      the greatest richness of Proteaceae in SWA,
