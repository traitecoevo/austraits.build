  notes: none
sites: detailed site description provided in referenced manuscript, but not relevant
  to subset of traits included in AusTraits. The author indicates these data were
  all sourced from other trait databases, but more than half of the trait values are
  not yet in AusTraits. The others are duplicates of categorical trait values from
  a diverse collection of studies; there is not a single manuscript from which they
  are sourced and therefore they are left in AusTraits.
