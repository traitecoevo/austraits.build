  sampling_strategy: A permanent transect, 67 m long, from the flats up the western
    flank of the larger of the two sand ridges was marked out by means of wooden pegs
    positioned at 1 m intervals (Fig. 1). The site of the transect was chosen arbitrarily
    to run close and parallel to an existing line of test bores, though far enough
    removed from them to avoid the disturbance associated with weekly checking of
    the water table. The transect passes through communities designated Leptocarpus
    meadow, Leptospermum-Restio low shrub and Banksia low shrub forest (Speck 1952;
    Baird and Speck, unpubl. data). A graded fire break at the foot of the ridge presented
    a problem in that a series of samples covering all stages of the vegetation from
    the flats and up the slope was considered essential to the investigation. For
    this reason, the first 17 m ran almost parallel to the fire break, then continued
    up the slope at right angles. The elevation of each peg and the six test bores
    was measured relative to the Lands and Surveys bench mark (Cannington No. 2) at
    the corner of Brook and Grove Roads. The elevation of each metre quadrat sampled
    was taken as the average of that of the two relevant corner pegs. Depth to the
    clay pan was measured with a soil auger for the first 40 quadrats and estimated
    from data from the test bores for the remaining intervals. Weekly readings of
    the depth to the water table at each of the six bores were available for the period
    January 1978-September 1980, and for the current study, averaged on a monthly
    basis    Floristic analysis - Rooted density and projected foliage cover percentage
    were determined for all perennial species present in quadrats 1 m2 placed at each
    transect interval. Axes of floristic similarity were established with non-centred
    principal components analysis (PCA) for both density and cover data sets and for
    species and samples using the 'Ordiflex' program of the Cornell Ecology Program
    Series (Gauch 1973).  See below for leaf traits measured.

  Yule Brook Botany Reserve:
    longitude (deg): 115.95
    latitude (deg): -32.0333333
    description: The study gradient was located on the Yule Brook Botany Reserve,
      a 34 ha area of relatively undisturbed native vegetation, owned by the University
      of Western Australia and vested in the Department of Botany for research and
      educational purposes. The Reserve lies within the outer metropolitan sector
      of Perth in the suburb of Kenwick. Topographically the site consists of two
      low, well rounded sand ridges separated by a broad, sandy flat (Fig. 1 in manuscript).
      The sand is excessively leached, nutrient-poor and overlies an almost impermeable
      clay pan. Regional drainage is poor and the position of the clay horiion at
      shallow depths below the surface on the flats leads to severe waterlogging conditions
      in winter and extreme desiccation in summer. It is the relationship between
      topography, depth of sand and position of the fluctuating water table that has
      been considered a major determinant of the vegetation pattern of the Yule Brook
      Botany Reserve (Speck 1952; Baird and Speck, unpubl. data).

  methods: In order to extrapolate the species cover values recorded for the floristic
    analysis along the elevational gradient to the more functional values of total
    leaf area and leaf specific weight, a series of plants or groups of plants was
    harvested either directly from the transect or in the immediate vicinity. Projected
    foliage cover was also estimated for these samples; then all leaves were stripped
    from the stems, carefully pressed and dried. After drying, the total weight of
    the leaves, and the weight of an unbiased subsample, which included leaves at
    all stages of development were recorded. The leaves in the subsample were counted
    and arranged between two sheets of clear adhesive plastic film. Projected leaf
    area for the subsample was determined by passing the plastic film through a photoelectric
    leaf planimeter. Estimates were made for each species of the area not measured
    owing to unsatisfactory pressing and, where necessary, corrections were made.
    Area determinations on rehydrated herbarium specimens have shown that, on average,
    sclerophyllous leaves are approx. 10% smaller (linear measurement) when dried
    (Green 1959). No corrections for shrinkage were made here as all species were
    treated in the same manner, and results were primarily for comparative purposes.
    Projected leaf areas were used in all further manipulation, i.e. one-sided area
    for dorsiventral leaves and a straight projection for terete or half-terete leaves.
    This approach was decided upon partly for technical reasons of difficulty in determining
    total areas for divided leaves, such as those of Adenanthos cygnorum, and partly
    because it was not intended to investigate stomata1 distribution and transpirational
    area for all the species present. Pinnules of the one species with compound leaves
    (Acaciapulchella) were considered as individual leaves following the approach
    of other studies of leaf sizes (Gentry 1969; Werger and Ellenbroek 1978), and
    the phylloclades of Jacksonia floribunda were treated as leaf equivalents for
    the purposes of this study. Leaf specific weight (g dm-2) was calculated from
    the weights and areas of the subsample of leaves.
