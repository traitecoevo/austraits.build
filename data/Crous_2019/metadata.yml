  description: Live leaf, senesced leaf, and wood nutrient measurements to determine
    if their stoichiometry in leaves and wood was maintained or altered in a long-term
    elevated CO2 experiment in a mature Eucalyptus forest on a low P soil
  collection_type: field_experiment
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: The Free-Air CO2 enrichment site consists of six 25 m diameter
    circular plots (hereafter referred to as 'rings') from which 32 vertical pipes
    are extended above the forest canopy, as described previously in Gimeno et al.
    (2016) and Duursma et al. (2016). Three rings were exposed to an elevated [CO2]
    treatment (ambient C150 umol mol-1) while the other three rings were used as control
    plots representing the ambient [CO2] treatment (400 umol mol-1), with identical
    infrastructure and instrumentation as the treatment plots. Pre-diluted CO2 is
    released into the treatment rings in a computer controlled system aiming for a
    CO2 mole fraction of 150 umol mol-1 above ambient since February 2013.

  trait_name: specific_leaf_area

  methods: Green fully expanded mature leaves were collected from three (co-)dominant
    trees in each plot using multiple 36 m tall canopy-access cranes (Jaso crane J-4010,
    Jaso S.L., Idiazabal, Spain). Leaves were collected from the top of the tree crowns
    at 17-23 m height, depending on the height of dominant trees within the plots.
    Measurements of leaf N and leaf P on fully expanded mature green leaves started
    in May 2012 before CO2 fumigation at EucFACE was turned on. Additional leaves
    were sampled several times per year from 2013-2018, viz. Jan./Feb., April/May,
    and Sept./Oct., totaling 473 green leaf samples. This roughly corresponded to
    1 or 2 subsample leaves per tree and three trees x 6 plots x3-4 times of year
    x 5 1/2 years. In a randomized design for the overall experiment, degrees of freedom
    were allocated for true replicates (plots) and subsamples within plots were averaged.
    Leaf life span in E. tereticornis was on average 13 months (Duursma et al., 2016)
    with newly flushed leaves here defined as less than 90 days old and mature leaves
    defined as more than 90 days old, consistent with Wujeska-Klause et al. (2019)
    and based on phenological observations of timing of leaf flushing (Ellsworth,
    unpublished). For most of the year, leaves were mature and older than 90 days,
    but during summer when canopy turnover occurred, two leaf age classes were collected
    (when available) including newly flushed fully expanded leaves and old mature
    leaves. Upon collection, leaves were placed on ice and measured for leaf area,
    after which they were freeze-dried for at least 72 h to determine leaf mass per
    area (LMA, g m-2), and then prepared for chemical analyses when ground to a fine
    powder.

    leaf, twigs, bark, and other material, then oven-dried at 40 deg C and weighed.

    was analyzed from 2-3 traps per ring for total N and total P concentrations for
