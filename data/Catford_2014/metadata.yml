  description: Study of River Murray wetland plants
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: Surveys were conducted in 24 floodplain wetlands a contiguous
    395 km long stretch of the regulated River Murray between Albury and Barmah, south-eastern
    Australia (see Fig. S1 in Supporting Information). In the late 19th century, small
    weirs were constructed along the river to facilitate water extraction, but it
    was not until the 1920s that major works began (Jacobs 1990). As described previously
    (Catford et al. 2011), the most upstream wetlands were just downstream of a major
    dam (Hume Dam). The effects of flow regulation generally decreased with distance
    downstream, largely because of additional water entering the river from unregulated
    tributaries. Reflecting that 90-98% of the diverted water is used for irrigation
    (MDBMC 1995), winter and spring flows have generally diminished in the study region,
    while summer and autumn flows have increased (Maheshwari et al. 1995). Large infrequent
    floods (>40 to 50 years average return interval, ARI) have not been altered by
    regulation, but floods that previously had a 2 year and a 20 year ARI now have
    a 5 year and 32 year ARI respectively (Catford et al. 2011). The 24 study wetlands
    varied in degree of hydrological modification because of variation in downstream
    location and elevation on the floodplain. Described previously (Catford and Downes
    2010, Catford et al. 2011), wetlands were surveyed in the austral summer using
    a stratified random approach (13 Dec. 2005-4 Feb. 2006). Vegetation was surveyed
    in a 1 m2 quadrat at 24 random points in each wetland (8 points across three depth
    strata). Foliar cover of all taxa in the quadrat was estimated using the Braun-Blanquet
    scale (converted to mid-point averages for statistical analysis; Catford and Downes
    2010). Data from the three depth-strata were given equal weight despite differences
    in their areal extent. Described previously (Catford and Downes 2010, Catford
    et al. 2011), wetlands were surveyed in the austral summer using a stratified
    random approach (13 Dec. 2005-4 Feb. 2006). Vegetation was surveyed in a 1 m2
    quadrat at 24 random points in each wetland (8 points across three depth strata).
    Foliar cover of all taxa in the quadrat was estimated using the Braun-Blanquet
    scale (converted to mid-point averages for statistical analysis; Catford and Downes
    2010). Data from the three depth-strata were given equal weight despite differences
    in their areal extent. Of 157 taxa recorded, 127 were identified to species-level,
    139 to genera and 148 to family (authority, Botanic Gardens Trust 2007, Catford
    et al. 2011). One hundred species were classified as terrestrial (i.e. species
    that inhabit dry areas of wetlands where the water table is below the soil surface
    or the soil saturated; Brock and Casanova 1997) and used in analyses. At the most,
    cover of all unidentified plant taxa (mostly daisies, grasses and seedlings) made
    up <6% of wetland vegetation cover (mean = 1.8%). A few of the unidentified taxa
    may have been exotic, but their low cover makes it unlikely that their exclusion
    affected our findings. Depending on plant habit and conditions at time of collection,
    plants were either growing in dry, damp, saturated or flooded soil. Species were
    classified based on their i) germination requirements (i.e. whether species germinate
    on saturated or dry soil; Brock and Casanova 1997), ii) longevity (annual and
    biennial versus perennial; Botanic Gardens Trust 2007), iii) geographic origin
    (exotic or native to Australia), iv) weed status (i.e. weed of agriculture and
    disturbed areas), v) whether they are cultivated and used as ornamentals (Randall
    2007) and vi) whether they can reproduce vegetatively (clonality).

    using some custom R code saved in the Austraits project.
  notes: There are a few species whose seed masses are almost certainly in grams (instead
    of mg), as their seed mass values are on the order of 10^3 smaller than other
    AusTraits entries. These values have been manually adjusted in AusTraits, 15-02-2022,

    description: The surrounding floodplain has been used for logging, livestock grazing,
      as a source of charcoal and honey, and for settlement, recreation and tourism
      (Eastburn 1990). Current forestry practice is based on selective logging or
      clearing of small patches. Cattle grazing commenced in 1838 and continues today,
      but sheep grazing has largely ceased (Smith and Smith 1990). There was no tree
      canopy directly above the study wetlands. All soil in the region was similar
      (~45% clay content).

  methods: 'Whether intentional or unintentional, human actions and activities can
    facilitate the spread and establishment of some species. Because species associated
    with human activities can experience a dispersal or storage advantage, it was
    important to consider whether a species is associated with human activities or
    not. We used two classifications to achieve this end: 1) whether a species is
    known to be a weed of agriculture or disturbed areas, and 2) whether a species
    has escaped from cultivation or is used as an ornamental. The first classification
    primarily relates to unintentional facilitation, e.g. dispersal of weeds of disturbed
    areas by vehicles along roads, facilitation of colonisation and establishment
    through activities such as tilling and fertiliser application. The second classification
    relates to species that were originally, and, in many cases, still are planted
    intentionally by humans either for cultivation or as ornamentals. Weeds of agriculture
    were identified using a list generated by Randall (2007). We identified weeds
    of disturbed areas by referring to a variety of sources (Parsons 1973, Carr 1989,
    Parsons and Cuthbertson 1992, Thorp and Wilson 1998-, Blood 2001, Muyt 2001, Sainty
    & Associates Pty Ltd 2001): a species was classified as a weed of disturbed areas
    if it was present in at least one of these lists (i.e. if listed as occurring
    along roads or in disturbed areas). We combined these two categories to give weeds
    of agriculture or disturbed areas. Species that have escaped from cultivation
    were identified using a list generated by Randall (2007). We identified species
    used as ornamentals by searching online lists of commercial nurseries. Species
    were only included in this category if they were available for sale in Australia
    for commercial or private use in gardens (including water gardens) or for landscaping.
    We did not include native species that are only sold for restoration purposes
    or can only be bought after special order. We also categorised species as ornamental
    if listed as such in the following references: (Parsons 1973, Carr 1989, Parsons
    and Cuthbertson 1992, Thorp and Wilson 1998-, Blood 2001, Muyt 2001, Sainty &
    Associates Pty Ltd 2001). We combined these two categories to give cultivated
    or used as an ornamental. Although it is difficult for lists such as these to
    be entirely representative (especially when binary classifications are used),
    we believe that use of these classifications albeit imperfect is nevertheless
    informative as they do offer some indication of whether a species is likely to
    be associated with human activities or not.'
