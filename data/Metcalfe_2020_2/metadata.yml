  notes: Duplicate values for seed mass, plant height, leaf width and leaf length
    have been filtered out if they are identical to one of the studies tagged as a
    "reference book" or herbarium collection in AusTraits. There are still a few duplicates,
    generally in cases where subspecies were listed in this study. There are also
    still some duplicates with Kew_2019_1 for seed_mass, because the filter removed
    instances where the maximum values from Kew matched the values in this study.
