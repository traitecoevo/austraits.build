  description: western NSW trait data from Michelle Leishman
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sites:
    Louth:
      longitude: 145.1333
      latitude: -30.5167
  sampling_strategy: We sought to include all species occurring on de- fined sites, in order to avoid bias in favour of species which were easier to collect or characterize. A plant species list was collated for four sites (Table 1) within the semi-arid woodlands of western New South Wales, in the vicinity of Louth (30?31'S, 145?08'E). (A complete species list is available from the first author.) The four sites were in the same climatic zone and have an annual rainfall of c.300 mm which is highly unpredictable and aseasonal. The three main soil types of the region were represented, site 1 had a level to slightly undulating topography of hard red-earth soils; site 2a was a slightly un- dulating sandplain with soft red soils; and site 3 was located on the floodplain of the Darling River on gilgaid heavy-clay soils. Each site was 200-500 ha in area. Site 2a was heavily grazed and had rela- tively few species (n = 89); consequently a species list from another site within 50km on the same soil type was used as a supplement (site 2b). This resulted in a total of 131 species for the sandy red-earth soil type.

  value_type: unknown

  methods: Data on some attributes such as growth form, leaf texture and hairiness, flowering characteristics, presence of spines and seed dispersal mode could be col- lected from observations of each species in the field. Where field specimens were inadequate, herbarium specimens were used. Data on morphological features that could not be reliably collected from field specimens were obtained from exhaustive reviews of the literature. These features included maximum height gained, presence of storage organ, depth of root system and presence of secondary compounds.

  methods: Data on some attributes such as growth form, leaf texture and hairiness, flowering characteristics, presence of spines and seed dispersal mode could be col- lected from observations of each species in the field. Where field specimens were inadequate, herbarium specimens were used. Leaf area and diaspore weight were measured using specimens collected from the field wherever possible, or alternatively from herbarium specimens and seed collections.
