  description: western NSW trait data from Michelle Leishman
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: We sought to include all species occurring on de- fined sites,
    in order to avoid bias in favour of species which were easier to collect or characterize.
    A plant species list was collated for four sites (Table 1) within the semi-arid
    woodlands of western New South Wales, in the vicinity of Louth (30 deg 31'S, 145
    deg 08'E). (A complete species list is available from the first author.) The four
    sites were in the same climatic zone and have an annual rainfall of c.300 mm which
    is highly unpredictable and aseasonal. The three main soil types of the region
    were represented, site 1 had a level to slightly undulating topography of hard
    red-earth soils; site 2a was a slightly undulating sandplain with soft red soils;
    and site 3 was located on the floodplain of the Darling River on gilgaid heavy-clay
    soils. Each site was 200-500 ha in area. Site 2a was heavily grazed and had rela-
    tively few species (n = 89); consequently a species list from another site within
    50km on the same soil type was used as a supplement (site 2b). This resulted in
    a total of 131 species for the sandy red-earth soil type.

  trait_name: plant_growth_form
  entity_type: species
  value_type: mode
  basis_of_value: expert_score
  replicates: .na
  methods: Data on some attributes such as growth form, leaf texture and hairiness,
    flowering characteristics, presence of spines and seed dispersal mode could be
    collected from observations of each species in the field. Where field specimens
    were inadequate, herbarium specimens were used. Data on morphological features
    that could not be reliably collected from field specimens were obtained from exhaustive
    reviews of the literature. These features included maximum height gained, presence
    of storage organ, depth of root system and presence of secondary compounds.

  methods: Data from published flora. Data on some attributes such as growth form,

    field. Where field specimens were inadequate, herbarium specimens were used. Data

    flowering characteristics, presence of spines and seed dispersal mode could be
    collected from observations of each species in the field. Where field specimens
    were inadequate, herbarium specimens were used. Leaf area and diaspore weight
    were measured using specimens collected from the field wherever possible, or alternatively
    from herbarium specimens and seed collections. Leaf area is a continuous variable,
    based on measurements on collected leaves or from dimensions reported in a flora
    (length x width x 2/3)

    were inadequate, herbarium specimens were used. Leaf area and diaspore weight
    were measured using specimens collected from the field wherever possible, or alternatively
    from herbarium specimens and seed collections. (Values are categorical based on
    morphological descriptions of the diaspore. A minimum of 10 diaspores were sampled.)
