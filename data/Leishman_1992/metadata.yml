  description: western NSW trait data from Michelle Leishman
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: We sought to include all species occurring on de- fined sites,
    in order to avoid bias in favour of species which were easier to collect or characterize.
    A plant species list was collated for four sites (Table 1) within the semi-arid
    woodlands of western New South Wales, in the vicinity of Louth (30"31'S, 145"08'E).
    (A complete species list is available from the first author.) The four sites were
    in the same climatic zone and have an annual rainfall of c.300 mm which is highly
    unpredictable and aseasonal. The three main soil types of the region were represented,
    site 1 had a level to slightly undulating topography of hard red-earth soils;
    site 2a was a slightly undulating sandplain with soft red soils; and site 3
    was located on the floodplain of the Darling River on gilgaid heavy-clay soils.
    Each site was 200-500 ha in area. Site 2a was heavily grazed and had rela- tively
    few species (n = 89); consequently a species list from another site within 50km
    on the same soil type was used as a supplement (site 2b). This resulted in a total
    of 131 species for the sandy red-earth soil type.

traits:
- var_in: growth form
  unit_in: .na
  trait_name: plant_growth_form
  value_type: expert_mean
  replicates: .na
  methods: Data on some attributes such as growth form, leaf texture and hairiness,
    flowering characteristics, presence of spines and seed dispersal mode could be
    col- lected from observations of each species in the field. Where field specimens
    were inadequate, herbarium specimens were used. Data on morphological features
    that could not be reliably collected from field specimens were obtained from exhaustive
    reviews of the literature. These features included maximum height gained, presence
    of storage organ, depth of root system and presence of secondary compounds.

    of field data and literature searches.

    were measured using specimens collected from the field wherever possible, or alternatively
    from herbarium specimens and seed collections.
