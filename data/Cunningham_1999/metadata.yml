  description: Saul Cunninghams PhD data published in 10.2307/2657231 to investigate
    how species traits shift across nutrient and rainfall gradients.
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: All species used are evergreen, perennial plants naturally occurring
    in New SouthWales (NSW), Australia. Collections were made between latitudes 308309
    and 368309 S (Appendix A). We selected species according to the habitat that they
    successfully occupied, as determined first from their known distributions. Selection
    was then refined after site-specific data were collected. For the nutrient contrasts,
    we selected a set of 10 species pairs consisting of one species from low-nutrient
    soils and the other from higher nutrient soils, all within the coastal (higher
    rainfall) region of NSW. The distribution of species with regard to soil nutrients
    was judged initially from the literature. In many cases, field guides explicitly
    state preferred soils. In some instances, preferred soils were judged from preferred
    habitat; e.g., plants in heaths or in open eucalypt forests were judged to be
    distributed on lower nutrient soils, and those found in or near rain forest were
    judged to prefer richer soils. For rainfall contrasts, we selected a different
    set of 10 species pairs consisting of one species from the low rainfall western
    plains of NSW, and one species from the higher rainfall coastal region of eastern
    NSW. This east-west contrast provides a gradient in total rainfall, while keeping
    the seasonal pattern similar. We did not use species with distributions that encompassed
    both the coastal plain and the western plain, although some eastern species also
    occurred on the western slopes of the dividing range. Among the eastern species,
    we did not choose species found mainly on high-nutrient soils. Species pairs were
    chosen to form phylogenetically independent contrasts (PICs). Within the two sets
    of comparisons (the rainfall set and the soil nutrient set), each species pair
    shared a common ancestor different from the common ancestor of any other species
    pair in the set. Thus, each species pair represented a separate evolutionary divergence.
    Most PICs were species within genera; some contrasts were chosen at higher taxonomic
    levels, in case evolutionary divergences were apparent only in contrasts with
    a longer time since divergence.

- var_in: SLA (cm2g)
  unit_in: cm2/g
  trait_name: specific_leaf_area
  value_type: site_mean
  replicates: '5'
  methods: For determining leaf area and saturated and dry mass, we collected two
    fully mature leaves from the outside of the canopy of each of five plants (except
    for Myoporum acuminatum, for which only one plant was found at the site). These
    leaves were stored in plastic bags on ice. We treated the primary photosynthetic
    organs as leaves; thus, for some Acacia sp., the 'leaves' were, in fact, phyllodes.
    Leaves were dried at 80C for 48 h before dry mass (dm) was determined.
- var_in: Nmass
  unit_in: '%'
  trait_name: leaf_N_per_dry_mass
  value_type: site_mean
  replicates: '5'
  methods: This sample was frozen in liquid nitrogen within 1 h of field collection
    and was vacuum-dried before chemical analyses (in the laboratory of I. D. Hume,
    University of Sydney, for all but alkaloids).Total nitrogen concentration of leaves
    was determined by semimicro Kjeldahl digestion, with selenium as a catalyst (Ivan
    et al. 1974).
- var_in: leaf_dry_matter_content
  unit_in: g/g
  trait_name: leaf_dry_matter_content
  value_type: site_mean
  replicates: '5'
  methods: Before measuring the saturated mass of leaves (abbreviated in results as
    fm, for fresh mass), we allowed them to become turgid by resting them between
    wet paper towels for 10 min (Hendry and Grime 1993). Saturated mass is the hydrated
    mass of cell walls and cytoplasm. Leaves were dried at 80C for 48 h before dry
    mass (dm) was determined. Previous workers have variously chosen to express the
    dm:fm ratio as a degree of hydration, 1 - (dm/fm) (e.g., Shipley 1995), or as
    a tissue density, dm/fm (e.g., Witkowski and Lamont 1991, Ryser 1996). Because
    it is uncertain how fm relates to true leaf volume, there is some debate about
    this means of estimating density. We chose instead to express these data as a
    measure of potential leaf hydration. (The trait was recomputed as dm/fm for compilation
    in AusTraits.)
- var_in: leaf width (mm)
  unit_in: mm
  trait_name: leaf_width
  value_type: site_mean
  replicates: '5'
  methods: Leaf width was measured as the diameter of the largest circle that could
    be placed within the boundary of the leaf blade (the longest path across a continuous
    leaf surface). Thus, lobed or dissected leaves have relatively low leaf widths,
    given their area. Leaves with greater widths, by this measure, have greater effective
    leaf size (sensu Givnish 1979).
- var_in: total lamina thickness (um)
  unit_in: um
  trait_name: leaf_thickness
  value_type: site_mean
  replicates: '5'
  methods: For each species, we measured total lamina depth and the depth of each
    tissue layer by taking linear measurements at five different places, spread approximately
    evenly from near the midrib to the leaf edge; the average was calculated from
    these data.
- var_in: upper cuticle thickness (um)
  unit_in: um
  trait_name: upper_cuticle_thickness
  value_type: individual_mean
  replicates: '5'
  methods: Leaf structure was described from transverse sections, taken from the broadest
    part of the lamina of one leaf for each species. Fresh leaves were sectioned in
    a sliding microtome. Sections were stained with 0.05% toluidine blue to enhance
    definition of cell walls and then were temporarily mounted in 50% glycerol. Sections
    were examined under light microscope, and representative images were recorded
    with black and white film. These images were captured in digital form and were
    subsequently quantified using Scion ImagePC (alpha 7; Frederick, Maryland, USA).
    For each species, we measured total lamina depth and the depth of each tissue

- var_in: lower palisade cell cross-sectional area (um2)
  unit_in: um2
  trait_name: .na
  value_type: individual_mean
  replicates: '5'
  methods: Leaf structure was described from transverse sections, taken from the broadest
    part of the lamina of one leaf for each species. Fresh leaves were sectioned in
    a sliding microtome. Sections were stained with 0.05% toluidine blue to enhance
    definition of cell walls and then were temporarily mounted in 50% glycerol. Sections
    were examined under light microscope, and representative images were recorded
    with black and white film. These images were captured in digital form and were
    subsequently quantified using Scion ImagePC (alpha 7; Frederick, Maryland, USA).
    For each species, we measured total lamina depth and the depth of each tissue
    layer by taking linear measurements at five different places, spread approximately
    evenly from near the midrib to the leaf edge; the average was calculated from
    these data. We measured the cross-sectional area of five cells for each tissue
    and calculated the average.
