  description: Saul Cunninghams PhD data published in 10.2307/2657231 to investigate
    how species traits shift across nutrient and rainfall gradients.
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: All species used are evergreen, perennial plants naturally occurring
    in New SouthWales (NSW), Australia. Collections were made between latitudes 308309
    and 368309 S (Appendix A). We selected species according to the habitat that they
    successfully occupied, as determined first from their known distributions. Selection
    was then refined after site-specific data were collected. For the nutrient contrasts,
    we selected a set of 10 species pairs consisting of one species from low-nutrient
    soils and the other from higher nutrient soils, all within the coastal (higher
    rainfall) region of NSW. The distribution of species with regard to soil nutrients
    was judged initially from the literature. In many cases, field guides explicitly
    state preferred soils. In some instances, preferred soils were judged from preferred
    habitat; e.g., plants in heaths or in open eucalypt forests were judged to be
    distributed on lower nutrient soils, and those found in or near rain forest were
    judged to prefer richer soils. For rainfall contrasts, we selected a different
    set of 10 species pairs consisting of one species from the low rainfall western
    plains of NSW, and one species from the higher rainfall coastal region of eastern
    NSW. This east–west contrast provides a gradient in total rainfall, while keeping
    the seasonal pattern similar. We did not use species with distributions that encompassed
    both the coastal plain and the western plain, although some eastern species also
    occurred on the western slopes of the dividing range. Among the eastern species,
    we did not choose species found mainly on high-nutrient soils. Species pairs were
    chosen to form phylogenetically independent contrasts (PICs). Within the two sets
    of comparisons (the rainfall set and the soil nutrient set), each species pair
    shared a common ancestor different from the common ancestor of any other species
    pair in the set. Thus, each species pair represented a separate evolutionary divergence.
    Most PICs were species within genera; some contrasts were chosen at higher taxonomic
    levels, in case evolutionary divergences were apparent only in contrasts with
    a longer time since divergence.

  notes: Many other traits have been measured that are not currently part of Austraits, including Slcerification (percent), leaf width, depth of different leaf tissues (total lamina, upper cuticle, upper epidermis, upper hypodermis, upper palisade, spongy mesophyll, lower palisade, lower hypodermis, lower epidermis, lower cuticle), cell cross-sectional area of different leaf tissues (upper epidermis, upper hypodermis, upper palisade, spongy mesophyll, lower palisade, lower hypodermis, lower epidermis, and weighted mean cell size), and leaf chemistry including essential soils, a phenolics index, a tannis index, whether alkaloids are present, and neutral detergent fiber (a measure of amount of cell wall material)

  methods: For determining leaf area and saturated and dry mass, we collected two fully mature leaves from the outside of the canopy of each of five plants (except for Myoporum acuminatum, for which only one plant was found at the site). These leaves were stored in plastic bags on ice. We treated the primary photosynthetic organs as leaves; thus, for some Acacia sp., the 'leaves' were, in fact, phyllodes. Leaves were dried at 80°C for 48 h before dry mass (dm) was determined.

  methods: This sample was frozen in liquid nitrogen within 1 h of field collection and was vacuum-dried before chemical analyses (in the laboratory of I. D. Hume, University of Sydney, for all but alkaloids).Total nitrogen concentration of leaves was determined by semimicro Kjeldahl digestion, with selenium as a catalyst (Ivan et al. 1974).
