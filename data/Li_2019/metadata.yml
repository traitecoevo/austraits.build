  description: Using a common garden experiment, we compared and contrasted four metrics
    commonly used to describe water use strategy during drought in 10 eucalyptus species
    comprising four major ecosystems in eastern Australia. We examined the degree
    to which these metrics were aligned with key stomatal and hydraulic traits related
    to plant water use and drought tolerance.
  basis_of_record: lab
  life_stage: sapling
  sampling_strategy: 2.1 Plant material and experimental design ^p Ten eucalypt species
    representing four major woody vegetation ecosystems across NSW, Australia, were
    chosen for the study (Table 1). Across this ecologically diverse group, species
    climate-of-origin (averaged across their native distributional range) varied tremendously,
    with the mean annual precipitation (MAP, mm) ranging from 250 to 1,124 mm, and
    mean annual temperature (MAT, °C) ranging from 10 to 18°C. The aridity index (AI),
    defined as the ratio of MAP and potential evaporation, ranged from 0.2 for Eucalyptus
    largiflorens (most arid) to 1.1 for Eucalyptus viminalis (most mesic). ^p Seeds
    were obtained from Mount Annan Botanical Garden (Mount Annan, NSW, Australia)
    and were sown in forestry tubes in a sun-lit polytunnel provided by Greening Australia
    (Richmond, NSW, Australia) under ambient environmental conditions until seedlings
    were approximately 15 cm tall. On 21 November 2017, seedlings were moved to the
    polytunnel greenhouse facility of Western Sydney University (33°33'S, 150°44'E,
    Richmond, NSW, Australia) and transplanted into 25-L woven planter bags filled
    with roughly 20-kg loamy sand soil (Menangle Sand & Soil, Menangle, NSW, Australia).
    Pots were placed onto palettes to prevent root growth outside the pots. Soil was
    manually watered to drainage immediately after transplanting and was watered for
    10 min every other day using a computer-controlled irrigation system to keep the
    water content at field capacity. Commercial controlled-release fertilizer (Osmocote,
    All purpose) was applied to ensure plants were not nutrient limited during the
    experimental period. Environmental conditions in the polytunnel were recorded
    at 15-min intervals by a data logger (CR300; Campdell Scientific Inc) connected
    to a light sensor (Decagon Devices Inc., Pullman, WA, USA) and temperature/relative
    humidity probe (HMP60-L, Campbell Scientific Inc., Logan, UT, USA) installed at
    1.5 m above the ground. During the experimental period, mean daily photon flux
    density was 6.67 mol m-2 day-1, mean daily temperature was 22.6°C and mean daily
    relative humidity was 64.3%. ^p The polytunnel was divided into six replicate
    blocks to account for potential environmental variation. In addition, we had a
    single row of border trees with randomly selected species to minimize environmental
    perturbation from outside. Within each block, three or four plants of each species
    were randomly allocated. Species differed greatly in their rate of growth, so
    we separated the species into three subgroups and applied the drought treatment
    to each group at different times once the plants had grown between 60 and 100
    cm tall. Group 1 consisted of the species Eucalyptus blakelyi, E. grandis and
    E. viminalis; group 2 consisted of Angophora costata, Corymbia gummifera, E. melliodora
    and E. sideroxylon; and group 3 consisted of E. lagiflorens, E. macrorhyncha and
    E. populnea. All groups were subject to the drought treatment within a two-month
    period, from early to mid-Autumn. During a pre-treatment drought hardening cycle,
    plants were dried until leaves were visually wilting, which was usually achieved
    within 1-2 weeks depending on weather conditions and species drought sensitivity.
    Thereafter, soil was rewatered and maintained at field capacity for 4-6 days to
    achieve full leaf water content (i.e., psipd ≈ 0). In the drought treatment, irrigation
    was discontinued and plants were allowed to use up available soil water and dehydrate.
    During the drought treatment, soil water potential was monitored regularly using
    predawn leaf water potential (psipd) as a proxy. For leaf water potential measurement,
    one leaf per plant was excised and immediately sealed in humidified plastic ziplock
    bags. The leaf samples were transported to the laboratory and leaf water potential
    measured using a Scholander-type pressure chamber (PMS Instruments, Corvallis,
    OR, USA).

  methods: in Blackman_2019; For each individual, one upper canopy leaf was sampled
    before sunrise and the cut end immediately placed in water. For species with reduced
    petioles, a terminal branchlet containing mature leaves was used. Samples were
    allowed to rehydrate in darkness for up to 3 hr. Leaf PV curves were generated
    following Tyree and Hammel (1972). Leaves or small shoots were slowly dehydrated
    under laboratory conditions, and psileaf and leaf fresh mass (FW) were measured
    periodically with the pressure chamber and a digital balance (weighed to 0.1 mg),
    respectively. PV curve analysis was performed following Lenz, Wright, and Westoby
    (2006). To facilitate calculation, the inverse of leaf water potential (1/psileaf)
    was plotted against leaf relative water content (RWCleaf, %). Leaf turgor loss
    point (TLP, -MPa) was taken as the inverse of the inflection point.

  methods: Leaf vulnerability curves were generated using the newly developed optical
    visualization technique (Brodribb et al., 2016). Three well-watered individuals
    for each species were selected for leaf vulnerability determination, with the
    exception of E. populnea, which was represented by two individuals. Plant material
    was collected in the early morning when xylem tension was minimal. Whole plants
    were excised within 5 cm of the soil surface and quickly transferred to a bucket
    filled with clean water. The cut end was immediately recut under water and the
    whole shoot portion placed inside an opaque plastic bag and transported to the
    laboratory. ^p Leaf images were captured using two custom-built leaf clamps (version
    1) equipped with a digital camera (Camera Module v2, Raspberry Pi Foundation,
    ENG, UK) and macro-lens (detailed description of the leaf clamp is available at
    www.opensourceov.org). For each individual, a recent, fully expanded leaf was
    mounted to the leaf clamp, with the adaxial side covered by a microscope slide
    to ensure a flat surface. The branch was dried under laboratory conditions (ca.
    48-120 hr, depending on species) until the targeted leaf became crispy. Images
    of the leaf within the clamp were taken at 5-min intervals. Leaf water potential
    (psileaf) was monitored simultaneously using a psychrometer (ICT International,
    Armidale, NSW, Australia) installed on the stem and close to the targeted leaf.
    It is possible that small water potential gradients may exist due to leaf cuticular
    conductance or leaky stomata after stomatal closure, resulting in a gradient between
    psileaf and stem water potential (psistem). However, by measuring psileaf regularly
    using the pressure chamber, we found this difference was negligible (data not
    shown). ^p Leaf images were analysed using an image subtraction method with ImageJ
    (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA) following Skelton, Brodribb,
    and Choat (2017). Briefly, images were stacked and any difference between two
    consecutive images was revealed by the “Image Difference” function in OSOV toolbox
    (www.opensourceov.org). The image stack containing the differences was then thresholded,
    and pixels representing embolism were highlighted using “Analyse Particles” function.
    Noise was removed manually when necessary. The number of pixels on each image
    was calculated using the “Measure Stack” function. Then, pixels were summed to
    give the total area symbolizing embolized veins during leaf dehydration. Percentage
    of embolism over time was calculated as the ratio of pixel area at each time point
    to the cumulative pixel area, and then plotted against psileaf to give the leaf
    vulnerability curve. Water potential inducing 50% loss of leaf conductivity (PL50)
    was taken as the psileaf when 50% of the total pixels appeared.

  methods: For each species, 8-10 upper canopy leaves were collected from five individuals
    for measurement of specific leaf area (SLA, m2/kg). Leaf area was measured using
    a leaf area metre (Li-3100C; Licor, Lincoln, NE, USA). Samples were oven-dried
    at 70°C for 48 hr until constant and then weighed. SLA was calculated as the ratio
    of leaf area to dry mass. The above-ground portion of the plants was harvested
    at the end of the experiment by cutting the stem from the base. Leaves were collected
    and oven-dried until constant mass. Total canopy leaf area was estimated using
    leaf dry weight and SLA. Basal sapwood diameter was measured using digital callipers.
    Huber value (HV, m2/m2) was calculated as the ratio of basal sapwood area to total
    canopy leaf area.
