  description: A study investigating the ranges of moisture content in live foliage,
    as the extent and severity of fires is linked to moisture content in live and
    dead plant material.
  basis_of_record: lab
  life_stage: sapling
  sampling_strategy: 2.1 Study species ^p We selected five Eucalyptus species, E.
    crebra F.Muell., E. fibrosa F. Muell., E. moluccana Roxb., E. sideroxylon Woolls.,
    and E. tereticornis Sm. The study species are tall eucalypts which overlap in
    parts of their ranges in eastern Australia, but with distributions that suggest
    a difference in climate preference (Figure 2). The species were therefore expected
    to differ in mean LMA, and thus differ in ranges of LFMC. Climatic envelopes for
    the study species were determined by extracting occurrence data from the Atlas
    of Living Australia (2024) using the R package galah (Westgate 2024) and combining
    this with climate data from the WorldClim database (Fick and Hijmans 2017) and
    the Global Aridity Index and Potential Evapotranspiration database (Zomer et al.
    2022). Across recorded occurrences of the study species, the mean annual precipitation
    ranged from 699-1005 mm y-1 and mean annual temperature ranged from 16.2-19.8
    °C (Table 1). For the sake of clarity we used a climate moisture index, calculated
    as mean annual precipitation divided by mean annual potential evapotranspiration,
    to indicate the availability of moisture. In this index, lower values indicate
    a lower availability of moisture. Median moisture index across recorded occurrences
    of the study species ranged from 0.40-0.63 (Table 1). ^p We grew ten individuals
    of each study species in a common garden within a polytunnel in Richmond, New
    South Wales, Australia. Individuals purchased for the experiment were all of similar
    height (between 1.7-1.9 m) and were potted in 300 mm pots with a standard potting
    mix, kept under well-watered conditions by drip irrigating twice a day for ten
    minutes at a time for a total of four litres per day. The common garden was maintained
    from June 2022 to February 2023, with the flammability experiments occurring in
    January and February (summer) of 2023. ^p 2.2 Leaf measurements ^p We collected
    leaves using a razor blade to remove the leaf at the base of its petiole. Sampled
    leaves were adjacent to each other on the same branch, mature, and without visible
    damage or deformity. Leaves were collected in the late afternoon, then labelled
    and rehydrated in a climate-controlled laboratory overnight. The following morning,
    the saturated leaves were used to measure traits.

  methods: We performed pressure-volume (P-V) curves following standard protocols
    (Sack et al. 2018), sampling two leaves each from three randomly selected individuals
    for each species. Leaves were rehydrated in standing water via the petiole to
    minimise oversaturation (Arndt et al. 2015). Rehydrated leaves were weighed at
    saturation then allowed to dry on the bench in the laboratory. As the leaves were
    drying, paired measurements of leaf mass and leaf water potential (PMS Instrument
    Company Model 1505D pressure chamber) were recorded, up to at least five measurements
    beyond the turgor loss point. Finally, leaves were weighed after drying in an
    oven at 105° C for 48 hours to obtain leaf dry mass. For each repetition of the
    standard measurements described by Sack et al. (2018), we calculated leaf moisture
    content according to Equation 2. Analysis of the P-V curves allowed us to calculate
    leaf saturated water content and psi-TLP, which were used to calculate leaf moisture
    content at saturation (MS) and at the turgor loss point (MTLP) for each leaf.
    We also used the P-V curves to describe the relationship between leaf water potential
    and leaf moisture content as a broken-stick linear model, following (Nolan et
    al. 2020a).

  methods: We sampled ten leaves each from three randomly selected individuals for each species. As with the leaves used for P-V curves, we sampled leaves in the late afternoon (between 1700 and 1800) and rehydrated them overnight in a dark container with the petiole standing in water. The rehydrated leaves were scanned and weighed in their saturated state at 0800 the next morning. We burned five leaves at saturation, 20 leaves after drying them for a range of shorter periods, and five leaves after drying for a long period (48 hours). The leaves burned at saturation were kept in the container until immediately before burning; the other leaves were allowed to dry in the laboratory so they could be burned at different moisture contents. The shorter drying times ranged from 5 minutes to 5 hours, and the long drying time was 48 hours before burning. Eucalyptus fibrosa leaves were especially slow to lose moisture, so an extra set of E. fibrosa leaves was burned after 72 hours of drying. ^p Following (Krix et al. 2022), we exposed leaves to radiant heat by inserting them into an ashing furnace set to 650° C. Radiant heat flux from the furnace walls to the leaf was estimated using the furnace dimensions, the temperature of the furnace walls, a standard emissivity value for the interior furnace material, and the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. The resulting estimated heat flux, approximately 40 kWm-2, fell within the lower end of the range used by (Krix et al. 2022) in a similar flammability experiment. We used this relatively low heat flux to ensure that any differences in time to ignition would be evident; the radiant heat to the leaves was expected to be similar to that in a low-intensity fire in a eucalypt forest (Wotton et al. 2012). We used a metal clip attached to a trolley to hold leaves as they were inserted into the open furnace, following (Krix et al. 2022). A camera was mounted in front of the furnace to record a video of each leaf as it was inserted and as it burned. All leaves were fully burned (i.e., reduced to ash, with no incandescence visible), except petioles. Petioles tended to burn separately and much more slowly than the other parts of the leaves, so were not included in calculation of flammability metrics. A video player (Avidemux 2.8.1 2022) was used to run the video frame-by-frame and record the time with 0.01 s precision from leaf insertion until it finished burning, and when flaming combustion started and stopped (if at all). ^p The flammability metrics assessed were ignitability, quantified as time to ignition (TI), sustainability, quantified as combustion time (TC), and whether combustion occurred with visible flames (flaming combustion) or not (smouldering combustion). Time to ignition measures the time required to ignite fuels exposed to a heat source, with ignition being defined by the presence of either flames or incandescence. TI was counted as the time from the first video frame in which the leaf was fully inserted to the first video frame in which incandescence was visible as glowing leaf material. Combustion time was counted from ignition to ash, i.e., from the first to the last frame in which some part of the leaf was visibly glowing.

  methods: We sampled ten leaves each from three randomly selected individuals for each species. As with the leaves used for P-V curves, we sampled leaves in the late afternoon (between 1700 and 1800) and rehydrated them overnight in a dark container with the petiole standing in water. The rehydrated leaves were scanned and weighed in their saturated state at 0800 the next morning. We burned five leaves at saturation, 20 leaves after drying them for a range of shorter periods, and five leaves after drying for a long period (48 hours). The leaves burned at saturation were kept in the container until immediately before burning; the other leaves were allowed to dry in the laboratory so they could be burned at different moisture contents. The shorter drying times ranged from 5 minutes to 5 hours, and the long drying time was 48 hours before burning. Eucalyptus fibrosa leaves were especially slow to lose moisture, so an extra set of E. fibrosa leaves was burned after 72 hours of drying. ^p Following (Krix et al. 2022), we exposed leaves to radiant heat by inserting them into an ashing furnace set to 650° C. Radiant heat flux from the furnace walls to the leaf was estimated using the furnace dimensions, the temperature of the furnace walls, a standard emissivity value for the interior furnace material, and the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. The resulting estimated heat flux, approximately 40 kWm-2, fell within the lower end of the range used by (Krix et al. 2022) in a similar flammability experiment. We used this relatively low heat flux to ensure that any differences in time to ignition would be evident; the radiant heat to the leaves was expected to be similar to that in a low-intensity fire in a eucalypt forest (Wotton et al. 2012). We used a metal clip attached to a trolley to hold leaves as they were inserted into the open furnace, following (Krix et al. 2022). A camera was mounted in front of the furnace to record a video of each leaf as it was inserted and as it burned.

questions:
  question1: Do you have individual-level data for additional traits (combustion times, time to ignition, other moisture variables)?
  question2: Can you tell me what trait I should map `CFT* (mol m-2 MPa-1)` to? I've looked through all the conductivity, conductance, capacitance, etc. traits and the units don't seem plausible for any of our traits.
  question3: For leaf area, leaf dry mass, the mean values in the manuscript are slightly different to those I derived from copying across the individual values from the PV curve spreadsheet. I'm guessing the mean values are for the leaves used in another component of the experiment?
  question4: Would you like me to leave this study on a branch until the publication is accepted?
  question5: Are there are additional data collectors you would like to add to this dataset? This can include supervisors who had a key role in designing the experiment and collection protocols.
  question6: I'm assuming you are also happy for this dataset to make its way into AusFizz?
