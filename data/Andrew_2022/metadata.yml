  description: A study of Acacia species to investigate the short-term acclimation
    of leaves to heatwaves, to better understand how one can prevent plant heat damage
    with increasing heatwave intensity.
  basis_of_record: lab
  life_stage: seedling
  sampling_strategy: Study species and experimental design ^p The genus Acacia is
    one of the most diverse taxonomic groups in Australia with over 1000 accepted
    species and are prolific in many Australian vegetation communities and climates.
    The seed for the study species were sourced from the seed banks of the Australian
    Tree Seed Centre and the Australian National Botanical Gardens. The subset of
    available species that were selected to be grown were chosen to include collections
    from a range of source sites across Australia's climatic regions. There were 21
    species grown but only 15 species (see Supplementary Table S1) that were sampled
    before and during the heatwave for PHT measurements. All 21 species are included
    in the Supplementary data but only the 15 species with data from both time points
    are included in the results presented here (see Supplementary R code). ^p Seeds
    were sown on 8 and 9 August 2019, immediately after activation to control seed
    germination date and therefore seedling age for this experiment. The seeds for
    some species could be activated with boiling water (2-3 min) while others with
    larger seeds needed scarification before being left to imbibe in water overnight
    after treatment. After imbibing, 3-5 seeds were sown per pot (15 cm diameter pots,
    volume ~3 L). The pots were laid out in a randomised block design with 15 blocks
    of 40 pots (600 pots in total) and with two pots per species in each block. The
    blocks were laid out across six sets of benches (~3.5 m x 2 m) with two columns
    of three benches running down each side of the very large glasshouse, each row
    of two benches had three blocks with the middle block split across the right and
    left bench. The soil used was a custom-made eucalypt mix consisting of 1/3 potting
    mix, 1/3 river sand and 1/3 peat moss. The soil was kept moist during this germination period and pots were watered 2-3 times per week or as needed thereafter. Pots were fertilised with nodule stimulating nitrogen-free McKnight nutrient solution
    each week (McKnight 1949). Thus, plants were not water or nutrient limited. Extra
    seedlings or late emerging seedling were removed weekly or replanted to empty
    pots, replanting stopped after the first 6 weeks. In the growth glasshouse, the
    temperature was set to 24°C day (13 h) and 18°C night (11 h). This glasshouse
    had evaporative cooling and had under bench heating, but temperature control was
    not perfect. Three temperature loggers were kept in the glasshouse to take temperature measurements hourly, the mean maximum daily temperature was 24.4°C (s.d. = 4.4°C)
    and the mean minimum daily temperature was 14.0°C (s.d. = 1.6°C), which is close
    to the expected values, but the hottest recorded temperature was 35.4°C and the
    minimum was 10.9°C. The plants also only received natural light and experienced
    natural changes in day length from the start of the experiment in winter to the
    end in summer. Despite this variation, all individuals were grown in a common
    environment from seed. ^p Seedlings were left to grow (size ranging from 12 to
    265 mm) until 28 November 2019 when pots were moved to the Cropatron glasshouse
    (run by the Australian Plant Phenomics Facility, https://www.plantphenomics.org.au/technologies/#greenhouses),
    which has a very high level of temperature control. From 28 November 2019 to 9
    December 2019 plants were left to acclimatise after the move with temperature
    set to the same as previous (24°C day and 18°C night). On 10 December 2019, 4
    months after planting, a 4-day heatwave treatment started, 38°C day (13 h) and
    26°C night (11 h). The duration and magnitude of this heatwave follows the Australian Bureau of Meteorology definition of at least 3 days of significantly above average
    maximum and minimum temperatures (http://www.bom.gov.au/australia/heatwave/knowledge-centre/). We took PHT measurements on the morning of the fourth day after the plants had
    completed three full days of maximum and minimum temperatures that were about
    50% higher than growing conditions. The maximum temperature of 38°C selected here
    represents the upper range of mean maximum temperature experienced during the
    warmest month of the year at these species source location (Table S1), thus is
    a realistic and common temperature during summer in many parts of Australia. Plants
    were watered each morning during the heatwave so the effect of the temperature
    stimulus could be considered independently of droughting. Temperatures ramped
    up at 0800 hours and sampling was done between 1030 hours and 1200 hours with
    leaf temperature measurements taken at the end of this period, consistent for
    both pre-heatwave and Day 4 heatwave measurement days. Leaf temperature was measured
    using a FLIRi7 infra-red imaging gun (FLIR, Wilsonville, OR, USA). The infra-red
    images were taken from above and were analysed by taking five points per plant
    in the middle of leaves/phyllodes to acquire an average leaf temperature per plant
    using FLIR image processing software (FLIR 3.4 R&D version). Leaf size and shape
    varied greatly between these Acacia species and measurements were focused on the
    larger mature leaves/phyllodes or leaf clusters when leaves were very small. At
    this early stage of growth, leaf size and shape also varied greatly within species
    and even on a single plant, making it difficult to consider species differences
    due to leaf morphology. How seedlings grew also varied, seedling maximum height
    aboveground and also the length of the main stem were both measured before the
    heatwave, because some species tended to grow along the ground, the maximum of
    these two measurements was used to assess seedling size (Fig. S1). ^p Leaf PSII
    heat tolerance ^p We excised two leaves per plant on the day prior to the heatwave
    treatment and on the fourth day of the heatwave, which represented 4-25 samples
    per species per treatment (Table S1). Leaf samples were either an ~10 mm diameter
    leaf disk for large leaves, a leaf section for narrow leaves, or a whole leaf
    sample when leaves were <10 mm in diameter. Collected leaf samples were kept in
    bags with wet paper towel to avoid leaf dehydration prior to measurements, which
    were initiated within 2 h of harvest and completed within 5 h. To measure PHT
    of the Acacia species, we measured the temperature-dependent chlorophyll fluorescence response (T-F0 curve) of leaf samples. Complete details of the system used are
    presented in Arnold et al. (2021). ^p Briefly, we attached leaf samples to white
    filter paper and placed on a Peltier plate (CP-121HT; TE-Technology, Inc., Michigan,
    USA). The thermoelectric modules of Peltier plate were controlled by a temperature
    controller (TC-36-25; TE-Technology, Inc.) and LabVIEW-based control software
    (National Instruments, Texas, USA) to heat the plate from 20°C to 70°C at a ramp
    rate of 60°C h-1. This ramp rate is commonly used for most studies of PHT and
    supports comparability with existing data from the literature (e.g. Buchner et
    al. 2015; Zhu et al. 2018; Arnold et al. 2021). As temperatures across the Peltier
    plate surface that contained leaf samples are stable within ±1°C, we attached
    two type-T copper-constantan thermocouples (40-gauge, 2 m length; Omega Engineering
    Inc., NSW, Australia) to the underside of two randomly selected leaves on the
    plate as representative measures of leaf temperatures during the assay. Thermocouple
    temperatures were recorded every 10 s by a data logger (EL-GFX-DTC; Lascar Electronics Ltd., Salisbury, UK) and the mean temperature of both thermocouples was used for thermal tolerance calculations. The Peltier plate assembly was fit within an aluminium frame at an ideal height below the fluorescence camera and double-glazed glass was used to compress samples against the plate surface to create a thermal buffer to ensure close matching of leaf and plate temperatures. ^p We used a Pulse Amplitude Modulated (PAM) chlorophyll fluorescence imaging system (MAXI-Imaging-PAM; Heinz
    Walz GmbH, Effeltrich, Germany) mounted above the Peltier plate to measure the
    basal chlorophyll fluorescence (F0) after 30 min of dark adaptation, while the
    Peltier plate ramp the temperature up from 20°C to 70°C.

  methods: The T-F0 curve produced by ramping the temperature of the leaf samples is characterised by a stable or slow-rise in F0 values until a critical temperature threshold where there is a fast rise in F0. We normalised F0 values for each leaf by scaling the minimum and maximum F0 values between 0 and 1, so that relative F0 values were used hereafter. We then calculated the inflection point of extrapolated regression lines for each of the slow and fast rise phases of the T-F0 curve. This was achieved using break-point regression of the mean leaf temperature (from the two thermocouples) and relative F0 values using the segmented package (Muggeo 2017) using the R Environment for Statistical Computing (R Core Team 2018). For each leaf sample, the inflection point referred to as the critical temperature, Tcrit, representing the onset of damage, the temperature at 50% of maximum F0 (T50) and the temperature at maximum F0 (Tmax), which corresponds to potential sustained damage to the photosynthetic apparatus, were extracted. There were 38 leaf samples where there was no clear inflection point in F0, from which Tcrit could not be discerned, which were therefore excluded. T50 was highly correlated with Tcrit (r = 0.92), therefore we used Tcrit and Tmax as measures of PSII heat tolerance hereafter. The T-F0 curve to derive heat tolerance limits is a long-established and widely used technique across ecological and agricultural studies (e.g. Schreiber and Berry 1977; Seemann et al. 1984; Hüve et al. 2011; Arnold et al. 2022; Marchin et al. 2022; Posch et al. 2022). Tcrit refers to the point of inactivation and potential damage to PSII, and Tmax represents its complete disruption (Schreiber and Berry 1977; Smillie and Nott 1979; Terzaghi et al. 1989; Knight and Ackerly 2002; Ilík et al. 2003; Neuner and Pramsohler 2006; Frolec et al. 2008; Hüve et al. 2011). The values of Tcrit and Tmax may not necessarily correspond to permanent or irreversible damage (Hüve et al. 2011), but they define limits for structural thermal stability of PSII, a key component of the electron transport chain, beyond which function is impaired. These metrics are particularly useful for quantifying the capacity for species to respond to temperature change and allow us to directly compare acclimation responses among species. ^p Because the same individuals were not sampled at the pre-heatwave and Day 4 time points, species means were used to calculate the acclimation of PHT between the pre- and during heatwave time points. PHT acclimation was derived as the difference in mean PHT from pre-heatwave to mean PHT measured on Day 4 of the heatwave (deltaTcrit and deltaTmax). We also calculated thermal safety margins (TSM) for each species as the differences between mean leaf temperature (Tleaf) and mean Tcrit or Tmax. Therefore, we have estimates for the TSM of inactivation of PSII (Tleaf - Tcrit) and for complete disruption and potential damage of PSII (Tleaf - Tmax). Post-heatwave recovery could not be measured due to root sampling and plant harvesting at the end of the heatwave for a related project.

The values of Tcrit and Tmax may not necessarily correspond to permanent or irreversible damage (Hüve et al. 2011), but they define limits for structural thermal stability of PSII, a key component of the electron transport chain, beyond which function is impaired. These metrics are particularly useful for quantifying the capacity for species to respond to temperature change and allow us to directly compare acclimation responses among species. ^p Because the same individuals were not sampled at the pre-heatwave and Day 4 time points, species means were used to calculate the acclimation of PHT between the pre- and during heatwave time points. PHT acclimation was derived as the difference in mean PHT from pre-heatwave to mean PHT measured on Day 4 of the heatwave (deltaTcrit and deltaTmax). We also calculated thermal safety margins (TSM) for each species as the differences between mean leaf temperature (Tleaf) and mean Tcrit or Tmax. Therefore, we have estimates for the TSM of inactivation of PSII (Tleaf - Tcrit) and for complete disruption and potential damage of PSII (Tleaf - Tmax). Post-heatwave recovery could not be measured due to root sampling and plant harvesting at the end of the heatwave for a related project.

  methods: The T-F0 curve produced by ramping the temperature of the leaf samples is characterised by a stable or slow-rise in F0 values until a critical temperature threshold where there is a fast rise in F0. We normalised F0 values for each leaf by scaling the minimum and maximum F0 values between 0 and 1, so that relative F0 values were used hereafter. We then calculated the inflection point of extrapolated regression lines for each of the slow and fast rise phases of the T-F0 curve. This was achieved using break-point regression of the mean leaf temperature (from the two thermocouples) and relative F0 values using the segmented package (Muggeo 2017) using the R Environment for Statistical Computing (R Core Team 2018). For each leaf sample, the inflection point referred to as the critical temperature, Tcrit, representing the onset of damage, the temperature at 50% of maximum F0 (T50) and the temperature at maximum F0 (Tmax), which corresponds to potential sustained damage to the photosynthetic apparatus, were extracted. There were 38 leaf samples where there was no clear inflection point in F0, from which Tcrit could not be discerned, which were therefore excluded. T50 was highly correlated with Tcrit (r = 0.92), therefore we used Tcrit and Tmax as measures of PSII heat tolerance hereafter.

questions:
  question1: The manuscript indicates 21 species were measured, but only 15 analysed
    because the others didn't have data from 2 points. Are these species still worth
    including? (Manuscript indicates they are included in SI, but I don't think they are.)
  question2: I've mapped tree height, leaf compoundness/leaf type as "species-level" traits, as they aren't exlpicitly connected to a population - therefore they don't show up as having a location.
  question3: I'm confused by one species being listed as having "biome = control".
