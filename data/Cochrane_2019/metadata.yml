  description: This paper explores the temperature dimension of the germination niche
    of eight herbaceous species from South West Western Australia as part of a broader
    assessment of endemic native species at risk of decline under global warming.
  basis_of_record: lab
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: Study species ^p Collections from eight herbaceous species endemic
    to Western Australia were selected for this study (Figs. 1 and 2). Five of the
    genera are endemic to Australia and two are globally widespread (Table 1). Anigozanthos
    manglesii subsp. quadrans Hopper (family Haemadoraceae) is a rhizomatous, perennial
    herb and the species is the floral emblem of Western Australia. Eleven species
    of Anigozanthos are endemic to Western Australia. Borya sphaerocephala R.Br. is
    known as a resurrection plant, capable of extreme desiccation and rehydration.
    It is a perennial herb found on granites and is in the endemic Australian family
    Boryaceae. This family contains 11 species, the majority found in Western Australia.
    Carex tereticaulis F.Muell., in the globally distributed family Cyperaceae, is
    a monoecious, rhizomatous, tufted perennial grass-like herb often found in seasonally
    wet peaty sands. Podolepis aristata Benth., Rhodanthe pyrethrum (Steetz) Paul
    G. Wilson and Xerochrysum macranthum (Benth.) Paul G. Wilson are members of the
    Asteraceae, a large, globally widespread family of mostly herbaceous species.
    The former two species are small annual herbs, whilst the latter species is a
    tall branched perennial herb. Xerochrysum has been introduced into horticulture
    and this long-lasting 'paper daisy' is a favoured plant for the cut flower industry.
    All three genera are endemic to Western Australia and all obligate seeders. Xyris
    lacera R.Br. and X. maxima Doust & B.J.Conn are tufted perennial herbs from the
    cosmopolitan family Xyridaceae. These Western Australian endemics are found in
    low lying areas such as drainage flats and swamps. Carex tereticaulis and X. maxima
    are listed in Western Australia as species of conservation concern (priority species;
    data deficient). The remaining species occur commonly throughout the South West,
    with the exception of the taxon A. manglesii subsp. quadrans which occurs north
    of Perth from Jurien Bay to north of Kalbarri. This taxon is hereafter now referred
    to only as A. manglesii. ^p Study location ^p Temperature and precipitation gradients
    are strongly influenced by latitude in the relatively low-relief landscape of
    Western Australia's South West, one of the five global Mediterranean-climate ecosystems
    (Hopper and Gioia 2004). The region, which is located at the cool, wet end of
    a hot, dry continent, has already experienced changes in weather patterns (Bates
    et al. 2012). Western Australia's temperatures have increased by approximately
    0.88°C since 1910, with most of the increase occurring post-1950 (www.bom.gov.au;
    www.ioci.org.au). Total annual rainfall in the South West itself has declined
    over the past 50 years and has been most apparent in late autumn and early winter
    (Bates et al. 2012). Future climate change scenarios vary but there are some common
    themes, there will be a continued upward change in mean annual temperature and
    a downward trend in patterns of precipitation. The coolest and wettest climate
    zones of the South West will contract (Bates et al. 2008, 2012) with a 0.5-2°C
    temperature increase and a 2-20% rainfall reduction projected for the region by
    2030. Species restricted to the more southerly areas of the region will be at
    greatest risk, with nowhere to go. Changes in species distributions are predicted
    (Hughes 2003). ^p Experimental design ^p A bi-directional temperature gradient
    plate (TGP - GRD1, Grant Instruments, Cambridge, UK) was used to deliver 196 different
    temperature combinations (constant and alternating) simultaneously. The temperature
    gradient plate method can detect thresholds more accurately than step-wise temperatures
    delivered by incubators, characterizing a fuller spectrum of responses to future
    temperature scenarios. Anigozanthos seeds were pre-treated prior to incubation
    by applying a 3 h 100°C heat shock treatment to overcome known dormancy (Tieu
    2000). No other pre-treatments were provided to any other species. All seeds were
    sown in 30 mm plastic Petri dishes on 0.75% (w/v) water agar. Seed numbers per
    dish ranged from 10 to 20 depending on species and each species was exposed to
    49 temperature combinations with a 12-h photoperiod for six weeks (4 species per
    run of the TGP). There was no capacity to replicate temperature conditions on
    the TGP but each species was represented by between ca 490-980 seed. Seed germination
    was checked three times weekly and germinated seeds showing a radicle ≥ 1 mm in
    length were considered germinated and removed. Percentage germination was calculated
    as the percentage of viable seeds that germinated within the incubation period.
    Seeds with a hard, white endosperm were considered potentially viable; empty seeds
    were removed from the original count.
