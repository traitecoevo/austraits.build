  sampling_strategy: The study was conducted in the south-eastern wheat belt in Western
    Australia. All nature reserves and parcels of unallocated crown land were considered
    for sampling in the 50 km x 70 km area bounded by Newdegate (33 deg 04'S, 119
    deg 04'E), Lake King, Cocanarup and Pingrup. The region has a dry mediterranean
    climate, with average annual rainfall at Lake Grace (the nearest long-term weather
    station) of 354 mm, mainly falling in winter. Mean monthly daily temperature maxima
    range from 15.4 deg C to 31.4 deg C, and mean monthly minima from 5.6 deg C to
    15.1 deg C (Bureau of Meteorology 2008). The region supports a mosaic of mallee,
    mallee-heath and woodland, with vegetation type determined by climate and especially
    edaphic factors (Beard 1990), and influenced by historic disturbance patterns.
    The mallee-heath community is characterized by a diverse shrub layer dominated
    by serotinous, non-resprouters (often Proteaceae), with scattered emergent mallees,
    most frequently Tallerack (Eucalyptus pleurocarpa) (Gosper et al. 2010). Thematuremallee
    community is characterized by a close-spaced canopy of mallees (most frequently
    E. scyphocalyx, E. phaenophylla and E. flocktoniae), over a sparse layer of mostly
    resprouting shrubs (especially Melaleuca spp.) and sedges (Parsons & Gosper 2011).
    Mallees are longlived Eucalyptus spp. characterized by numerous aerial stems,
    a narrow canopy zone, and a large lignotuber from which plants resprout after
    disturbances (Noble 2001). Plots of 10 m x 10 m were placed at a random point
    20-150 m into the vegetation from an access track. In spring 2007, we recorded
    all vascular plant species present and determined abundance using a line intercept
    technique by systematically placing a 12.5-mm diameter pole vertically at 50 points
    spread across the plot in a grid. Abundance for any species was the proportion
    of points at which any of its leaves, stems or inflorescences intercepted the
    pole. This technique provided an objective measure of abundance reflecting, but
    not equivalent to, projected cover, and encompasses growth of individual plant
    canopies as well as changes in plant density. Thismeasure is hereafter referred
    to as 'cover'. Species that were present but not recorded at point intercepts
    were allocated a nominal proportional abundance of 1%. Plant functional type classification
    We classified species on the basis of traits relevant to vegetation assembly through
    the initial floristic composition model. These were, (i) the capacity to resprout
    from fireresistant organs (e.g. lignotubers, rhizomes, etc.); (ii) the location
    and persistence of the seed bank (i.e. persistent canopy, persistent soil, transient
    soil); (iii) competitive stratum (upper, mid and ground), largely reflecting plant
    height; and (iv) longevity of standing plants (i.e. species divided into those
    that grow, reproduce and senesce primarily in the immediate post-fire period (<6
    yr post-fire) and those that do not (Table 1).
