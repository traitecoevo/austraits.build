  description: Seed response to warming was evaluated in a suite of short-range endemic
    species from the biodiverse Greenstone Belt of southern Western Australia.
  basis_of_record: lab
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: Species and seed collection ^p Of the 64 short-range endemic
    taxa known from the Greenstone Belt of the Ravensthorpe Range area (Markey et
    al. 2012), germination trials were conducted on 20 species representing ten genera
    from four families (Table 1; Fig. 1). Eleven of these species are species of conservation
    concern in Western Australia (threatened or poorly known) (Smith & Jones 2018),
    while the remaining nine are common although restricted in distribution. The majority
    of species co-occur with at least one other within their range, with the exception
    of Kunzea acicularis which has a very restricted distribution northeast of the
    Range. All species are woody perennials, ranging from a semi-prostrate shrub ca.
    0.5-m tall (Acacia bifaria) to trees that can attain a height of 10 m (Eucalyptus
    megacornuta and E. stoatei). Most of the species flower in spring, although this
    can vary depending on the season, and for non-serotinous species fruit is generally
    ripe by late summer. The exact timing of recruitment is not known for most species,
    and for a number the emergence of seedlings may be constrained to the post-fire
    environment (e.g. Allocasuarina, Banksia and Isopogon). At least three species
    are obligate resprouters. p Seeds were collected from up to 50 individual maternal
    plants per species from wild populations and bulked for germination purposes.
    Collections were made between 2002 and 2017, and older collections were dried
    at 15 °C and 15% relative humidity before storage in a seed bank before later
    use. Eight species in the family Fabaceae have hard seed and therefore exhibit
    physical dormancy; the remaining species have seeds that once released from fruits
    are generally non-dormant (Cochrane et al. 2002). Burning of woody fruiting cones
    was required in one species (Banksia) to enable seeds to be released. ^p Experimental
    design ^p A bi-directional temperature gradient plate (TGP) (GRD1; Grant Instruments,
    Cambridge, UK) was used to deliver 196 different temperature combinations between
    5 and 40 °C (constant and alternating) simultaneously (Figure S1). The TGP allows
    the detection of thresholds more accurately than step-wise temperatures delivered
    by incubators, characterising a fuller spectrum of responses to future temperature
    scenarios. In this way, two axes of the thermal niche for germination - minimum
    and maximum thermal limits - were investigated. The methods used for the experiment
    are as per Cochrane (2016). Seeds were sown in 30-mm plastic Petri dishes on 0.75%
    w/v water agar. Seed numbers per dish ranged from ten to 20 depending on species,
    and each species was exposed to 49 temperature combinations with a 12-h photoperiod
    for 6 weeks (four species per run of the TGP). Temperature conditions cannot be
    replicated during a run on the TGP so each temperature condition was represented
    by only one dish. Each seed was treated as an independent unit. Consequently,
    there is the potential for confounding effects in the data analyses due to absence
    of replication, which is duly acknowledged. Each species was however represented
    by between ca. 490 and 980 seeds. ^p Physical dormancy was overcome by manually
    scarifying seed with a scalpel to overcome hard seededness prior to incubation.
    Although non-dormant, the hairy nut of a further species, Isopogon sp. Ravensthorpe,
    was also manually scarified to aid germination (Cochrane unpublished data). A
    10% diluted solution of smoked water as Regen 2000 Smokemaster was applied to
    seeds of Kunzea acicularis (family Myrtaceae) for 24 h prior to rinsing in deionised
    water (DI) and incubation, as this has been shown to improve germination in this
    genus (Cochrane unpublished data).

    notes: The Ravensthorpe Range is located in southern Western Australia (Fig. 1).
      This area is internationally renowned for its rich floristic diversity and endemism
      (Hopper & Gioia 2004; Wilkins et al. 2011) and is one of 35 global biodiversity
      hotspots (Mittermeier et al. 2011). The Range falls within the UNESCO-listed
      Fitzgerald Biosphere, one of Australia's 14 biosphere reserves. Extending for
      approximately 50 km from Mt Short in the northwest to Bandalup Hill in the southeast,
      the Range has its highest point only 453 m a.s.l. Here, two-thirds of the annual
      rainfall occurs between May and October, but rainfall patterns can be variable
      and large rainfall events have been known to occur during the summer months.
      The coldest month is July with a daily mean of 16 °C, and the hottest month
      is January with a daily mean of 29 °C.

    for 6 weeks (four species per run of the TGP). Temperature conditions cannot be
    replicated during a run on the TGP so each temperature condition was represented
    by only one dish. Each seed was treated as an independent unit. Consequently,
    there is the potential for confounding effects in the data analyses due to absence
    of replication, which is duly acknowledged. Each species was however represented
    by between ca. 490 and 980 seeds. ^p Physical dormancy was overcome by manually
    scarifying seed with a scalpel to overcome hard seededness prior to incubation.
    Although non-dormant, the hairy nut of a further species, Isopogon sp. Ravensthorpe,
    was also manually scarified to aid germination (Cochrane unpublished data). A
    10% diluted solution of smoked water as Regen 2000 Smokemaster was applied to
    seeds of Kunzea acicularis (family Myrtaceae) for 24 h prior to rinsing in deionised
    water (DI) and incubation, as this has been shown to improve germination in this
    genus (Cochrane unpublished data). ^p Seed germination was checked three times
    per week and germinated seeds showing a radicle at least double the length of
    the seed were removed. At the end of the experiment, seeds with a hard, white
    endosperm were considered potentially viable; empty seeds were removed from the
    original count.

  methods: A bi-directional temperature gradient plate (TGP) (GRD1; Grant Instruments,
    Cambridge, UK) was used to deliver 196 different temperature combinations between
    5 and 40 °C (constant and alternating) simultaneously (Figure S1). The TGP allows
    the detection of thresholds more accurately than step-wise temperatures delivered
    by incubators, characterising a fuller spectrum of responses to future temperature
    scenarios. In this way, two axes of the thermal niche for germination - minimum
    and maximum thermal limits - were investigated. The methods used for the experiment
    are as per Cochrane (2016). Seeds were sown in 30-mm plastic Petri dishes on 0.75%
    w/v water agar. Seed numbers per dish ranged from ten to 20 depending on species,
    and each species was exposed to 49 temperature combinations with a 12-h photoperiod
    for 6 weeks (four species per run of the TGP). Temperature conditions cannot be
