traits:
- var_in: planttype
  unit_in: .na
  trait_name: plant_type_by_resource_use
  value_type: expert_mean
  replicates: .na
  methods: Kew Gardens collections, with details in data.csv file under column "refdesc";
    the same value has been reported in multiple sources included and so identical
    values for a species have been filtered out
- var_in: salt_tolerance
  unit_in: .na
  trait_name: salt_tolerance
  value_type: expert_mean
  replicates: .na
  methods: Kew Gardens collections, with details in data.csv file under column "refdesc";
    subset of 'planttype' values referring to salt tolerance strategies have been
    duplicates here; the same value has been reported in multiple sources included
    and so identical values for a species have been filtered out
- var_in: maxdsm
  unit_in: dS/m
  trait_name: soil_salinity_tolerance
  value_type: expert_mean
  replicates: .na
  methods: Kew Gardens collections, with details in data.csv file under column "refdesc";
    the same value has been reported in multiple sources included and so identical
    values for a species have been filtered out
