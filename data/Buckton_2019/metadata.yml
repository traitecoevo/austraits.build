  description: This study investigated the functional traits of lianas and trees in
    a lowland tropical forest in northeast Queensland, Australia to understand and
    predict the effect of lianas on ecosystem processes in tropical forests.
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: The study took place in a lowland tropical rainforest in Cape
    Tribulation, Queensland, Australia (16.1 deg S, 145.4 deg E). Multiple individuals
    of liana and tree species were accessed in an established 1-ha study plot (Laidlaw
    et al. 2007; Tng et al. 2016) using a canopy access crane (Liddell et al. 2007).
    The canopy crane is maintained by James Cook University and is part of the Daintree
    Rainforest Observatory (DRO). The crane (a Leibherr Model 91EC) is 48.5 m tall,
    with a 55 m jib, enabling access to the canopy of approximately 1 ha of complex
    mesophyll vine forest Type 1a (Tracey 1982). Average annual rainfall at the site
    is 4207 mm, with 70% of this falling during the wet season months of December
    to April. Soils at the DRO, using the Australian classification, are an Acidic,
    Dystrophic, Brown Dermosol with many (20-50%) cobbles and stones throughout the
    profile. The soil is developed in colluvium from the metamorphic and granitic
    mountains to the west. Individuals of tree and liana species were sampled randomly
    from April to June 2014, a time of year generally characterised by a transition
    from wet to dry season. Four to six individuals each of seven liana species and
    eleven tree species were sampled (Table 1). Species were selected for their abundance
    in the canopy, and only canopy-emergent individuals were sampled. This meant that
    the species selection was not structured to provide phylogenetically independent
    contrasts between trees and lianas, but was rather based on occurrence under the
    footprint of the crane. However, there were three con-familial pairs that were
    sampled, and for this subset of species, the trait patterns between trees and
    lianas were similar to those of the full dataset (Table 1). Water samples for
    isotopic analysis were collected from a range of water sources at the site including
    shallow soil moisture (SSM), deep soil moisture (DSM), ground water (GW), creek
    water (CW) and rainwater (RW). Soil moisture was collected using four pairs of
    pre-installed lysimeter tensiometers from depths of 50 cm (SSM) and 150 cm (DSM).
    The lysimeters were placed under vacuum using a hand-held pump and left to collect
    water over 24 h. Water that accumulated at the bottom of each lysimeter was withdrawn
    with a tube and syringe. Ground water was collected from a 34 m bore using an
    electric pump. Bore water was allowed to flow through the pump for one minute
    before collection. During sampling weeks, rainfall was collected in a clearing
    at the DRO using a Palmex Rain Sampler RS1 (Groning et al. 2012) recommended by
    the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to collect rainfall without evaporative
    enrichment. Creek water was collected from a creek that runs along the edge of
    the 1-ha plot from which plant samples were collected. All water samples were
    placed in vials, sealed with parafilm, and refrigerated until analysis. Water
    samples were analysed with a Picarro L2120i isotope ratio infrared spectrometer
    (IRIS) with a diffusion sampler interface (Munksgaard et al. 2011) calibrated
    against three secondary water standards calibrated to VSMOW using Isotope Ratio
    Mass Spectroscopy (see below).

  methods: For each individual, gas exchange measurements were made on three, newly

    system (Li-6400; Li-Cor, Lincoln, NE, USA). Maximum photosynthesis per unit leaf
    area (Aarea; umol CO2 m-2 s-1) and stomatal conductance to water vapour (gs; mol
    m-2 s-1) were measured with a constant photon flux density of 2000 umol m-2 s-1,
    under ambient CO2 concentration (400 ppm) and with the cuvette temperature maintained
    at 30 deg C. Photosynthetic rate per unit mass (Amass; nmol CO2 g-1 s-1) was calculated
    by dividing Aarea by LMA. Intrinsic water-use efficiency (WUEi; umol mol-1) was
    calculated by dividing Aarea by gs. Photosynthetic nitrogen-use efficiency (PNUE;

  methods: For all individuals, wood density (WD; g cm_3), defined as the dry mass
    per fresh volume, was calculated on a small stem segment (~1 cm diameter and ~4
    cm length) removed from the canopy and refrigerated in a sealed vial until measurement.
    Fresh volume was determined using the water displacement method, as described
    in Johnson et al. (2013). Stem samples were then placed in a drying oven at 70
    deg C for 48 h, and the dry weight measured using a microbalance. Prior to wood
    density measurements, a thin (1 mm) slice of the fresh stem was taken from each
    sample, placed on a glass slide with a drop of water and photographed under an
    Olympus SZX7 dissecting microscope fitted with an Olympus UC-50 camera. The ratio
    of sapwood area to total cross-sectional area was calculated for each stem segment
    using ImageJ software (Rasband, W.S., ImageJ, U. S. National Institutes of Health,
    Bethesda, MD, USA, http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/, 1997-2014). Sapwood was differentiated
    from bark and pith based on colour and general appearance

  methods: For all individuals, wood density (WD; g cm_3), defined as the dry mass
    per fresh volume, was calculated on a small stem segment (~1 cm diameter and ~4
    cm length) removed from the canopy and refrigerated in a sealed vial until measurement.
    Fresh volume was determined using the water displacement method, as described
    in Johnson et al. (2013). Stem samples were then placed in a drying oven at 70
    deg C for 48 h, and the dry weight measured using a microbalance. Prior to wood
    density measurements, a thin (1 mm) slice of the fresh stem was taken from each
    sample, placed on a glass slide with a drop of water and photographed under an
    Olympus SZX7 dissecting microscope fitted with an Olympus UC-50 camera. The ratio
    of sapwood area to total cross-sectional area was calculated for each stem segment
    using ImageJ software (Rasband, W.S., ImageJ, U. S. National Institutes of Health,
    Bethesda, MD, USA, http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/, 1997-2014). Sapwood was differentiated
    from bark and pith based on colour and general appearance

  methods: Xylem water was obtained by collecting stem segments (~1 cm diameter and
    ~8 cm length) from all tree and liana species. Stem segments were cut with secateurs,
    stripped of bark, and immediately placed in vials which were sealed with parafilm
    and stored in a freezer. Xylem water was later extracted by cryogenic vacuum distillation
    as described in Munksgaard et al. (2014). The oxygen isotopic composition of all
    plant water extracts was determined using high-temperature pyrolysis via a Thermo-Fisher
    TCEA (Thermal Conversion Elemental Analyzer) coupled to a Thermo Scientific Delta
    V Plus isotope ratio mass spectrometer. Water volumes of 0.1 lL were injected,
    using the last two replicates of four injections to reduce memory effects. The
    stable oxygen isotope composition was expressed in delta notation relative to
    the VSMOW standard (Coplen 2011). The results were calibrated to the VSMOW scale
    using secondary laboratory reference waters themselves calibrated to VSMOW2, SLAP2
    and GISP as primary reference waters. Hereafter, the d18O values of environmental
    waters are referred to as d18OSSM, d18ODSM, d18ORW, d18OCW and d18OGW for shallow
    soil moisture, deep soil moisture, rain water, creek water and ground water, respectively,
    and the d18O of xylem water is referred to as d18Oxylem.
