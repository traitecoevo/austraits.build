    description: Soil samples for this experiment were collected from Terrick Terrick
      National Park (TTNP), 225 km northwest of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. TTNP
      is situated within the Patho Plains, a sub-section of the Victorian Northern
      Plains Bioregion, and includes the Terrick Terrick Range and adjacent plain.
      Average annual precipitation for the Patho plains is ~400 mm, with winter months
      weakly dominating the rainfall patterns. Seasonal average maximum temperatures
      range from 30째C in summer to 15째C in winter. Seasonal average minimums range
      from 15째C in summer to 3째C in winter. The vegetation is a semi-arid Callitris
      grassy woodland typical of the rocky outcrops and outwash slopes at TTNP.
