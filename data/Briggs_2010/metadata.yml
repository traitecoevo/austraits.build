    description: Soil samples for this experiment were collected from Terrick Terrick
      National Park (TTNP), 225 km northwest of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. TTNP
      is situated within the Patho Plains, a sub-section of the Victorian Northern
      Plains Bioregion, and includes the Terrick Terrick Range and adjacent plain.
      Average annual precipitation for the Patho plains is ~400 mm, with winter months
      weakly dominating the rainfall patterns. Seasonal average maximum temperatures
      range from 30 deg C in summer to 15 deg C in winter. Seasonal average minimums
      range from 15 deg C in summer to 3 deg C in winter. The vegetation is a semi-arid
      Callitris grassy woodland typical of the rocky outcrops and outwash slopes at
      TTNP.

  methods: This experiment was designed to compare germination on different patch
    types amongst species. Seeds were collected from TTNP as they matured (September-October
    2006) and stored dry at room temperature.
