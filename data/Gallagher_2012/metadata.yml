  description: A collection of trait data on climbing plants (lianas, vines, scramblers)
  sample_age_class: adult
  collection_type: field
  sampling_strategy: Species-site observations We compiled a dataset of 2597 species-site
    observations (locations where the 1092 climbing plant species in our dataset have
    been recorded across the globe) from published literature. Species lists were
    extracted from 113 published studies identified using the search terms 'liana',
    'woody vine' or 'climbing  plant' in ISI Web of Science database (see Appendix
    S2 for a full list of studies). We excluded studies that did not include latitude
    and longitude coordinates of sampling locations, or an adequate locality description
    from which coordinates could be obtained using Google Earth. The taxonomy of all
    species in the dataset was updated using The Plant List (2010) (http://www.theplantlist.org/)
    - a standardized list of Latin names for the world's flora. The biogeographical,
    climatic and phylogenetic coverage of the final dataset is presented in Figs 1
    & 2. The final dataset encompassed 101 plant families and 415 genera.
  original_file: Gallagher_Leishman_2012_data.xls in raw data folder and GoogleDrive
    folder
  notes: The raw data file was filtered to only include Australian species. Data sourced
    from TRY was only used if it added a new species x trait combination to AusTraits
    (just two instances for SLA, none for leaf area). Seed mass values estimated from
    seed dimensions were also excluded.

  methods: Component of dispersal data, that are fruit types; We defined abiotic dispersal
    as the movement of propagules by wind or water, and biotic dispersal as the movement
    of propagules by animals, either through ingestion or adhesion. Unassisted seeds
    were classified as those species with no specialized structures for long-distance
    dispersal, which were also too large to be transported by wind.
