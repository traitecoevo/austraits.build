  description: various traits for 18 Australian species
  basis_of_record: lab
  life_stage: sapling
  sampling_strategy: We sampled dominant or very abundant tree species from humid
    and semi-arid savannas in Africa, Australia and South America (previously described
    in Tomlinson et al. 2012). We identified semi-arid and humid environments using
    the Koppen-Geiger climate classification (Kottek et al. 2006). This system estimates
    the relative water deficits of particular locations by comparing a dryness threshold
    based on the mean annual temperature (Tann, deg C) with MAP (mm) at those locations,
    adjusted for whether the region has predominantly winter or summer rainfall. Given
    a dryness threshold Pth = 28 + 2 (Tann), then semi-arid environments are defined
    in the range - 5 Pth < MAP < 10 Pth, and humid environments are defined as areas
    where MAP > 10 Pth. We sampled dominant or very abundant tree species from humid
    and semi-arid summer-rainfall savannas in southern Africa (coastal and inland
    savannas in South Africa and Zimbabwe) (Frost 1996; Mucina & Rutherford 2006),
    in north-eastern Australia (coastal and inland woodlands in Queensland) (Cole
    1986), and eastern South America (Cerrado and Caatinga biomes in Brazil) (Cole
    1986). Table S1 (Supporting Information) provides descriptive information for
    the sampled environments. The South American species were all sampled over low-fertility
    soils whereas the African and Australian species were sampled over a wider range
    of soil fertilities. A total of 51 species were grown, including 18 species from
    Australia (8 humid, 10 semi-arid), 21 species from Africa (10 humid, 11 semi-arid)
    and 12 species from South America (eight humid, four semi-arid). The species belonged
    to a wide variety of clades, representing nine plant orders, 13 families and 28
    genera. A full species list is provided in Table S2 (see Supporting Information),
    including their family, order, continent of origin, climate type of origin and
    leaf habit traits. The sampled species reflected continental biases in dominant
    plant families (Cole 1986) - Australian savannas are dominated by Myrtaceae and
    Fabaceae, African savannas are dominated by Combretaceae and Fabaceae, whereas
    humid South American savannas are composed of a large number of co-dominant families
    and semi-arid savannas are dominated by Fabaceae. Consequently, two plant orders
    (Fabales and Myrtales) formed the bulk of the species sample. GREENHOUSE EXPERIMENT
    We conducted a greenhouse experiment to evaluate the effect of leaf habit and
    climate type on traits of seedlings of the 51 savanna tree species selected from
    the three continents and grown in one common growth environment. We deliberately
    grew all species in a similar, favourable environment for a fair comparison of
    presumably genetically based (inherent) variation in the relevant traits. Plants
    were grown in a greenhouse chamber at Radix Research Farm, Wageningen University,
    The Netherlands (51deg 59'17''N, 5deg 39'45''E) between September 2008 and October
    2010. Temperature in the greenhouse was set at 28 deg C for 12 h (daytime) and
    23 deg C for 12 h (night time). These temperatures were chosen to lie within the
    range of mean minimum temperatures (17.4-24.2 deg C) and mean daily temperatures
    (24.8 -30.3 deg C) during the warmest month of the locations where seed was collected
    for the experiments. Daily variation of light in the greenhouse was from 150 to
    450 lmol m-2 s-1, supplied from sunshine and supplementary light. Supplementary
    light (150 lmol m-2 s-1) was provided for 12-16 h (seasonally adjusted) to ensure
    that the daily supply of photon flux density exceeded 10 mol m-2 day-1. Other
    studies have shown that the total daily photon flux density, rather than peak
    irradiance, is most important for plant growth (Poorter & Van der Werf 1998).
    Although the total amount of light is low by comparison with full sun environments
    in the tropics, plant growth was substantial in some species and varied substantially
    among species (Table S3 in Supporting Information; Tomlinson et al. 2012), indicating
    that available light was sufficient to distinguish growth abilities of different
    species. Tree seedlings were grown in plastic tubes of 10 cm diameter and 100
    cm length, to reduce pot limitation of root growth. Pots were filled with river
    sand mixed with slow-release fertiliser [Osmocote 18-6-12 (N-P-K) fertilizer (8-9
    month mixture)] at a concentration of 5 kg fertiliser m_3 river sand. We used
    a high level of fertility to facilitate maximum growth and differentiation among
    the species during the period of the experiment. Water was supplied through irrigation
    three times per day at a rate of 40 mL per pot per day, equivalent to 800 mm of
    rainfall over 20 weeks of growth. This was a much more even water supply than
    most of these species would receive in their natural environment, but the intention
    was to ensure that all the plants were wellwatered while they grew, so that water
    limitation did not contribute to any trait variation between species. Seeds were
    germinated for the experiment in the following manner - seed coats of hard-coated
    species were cut to allow water imbibition, and seeds of all species were soaked
    in distilled water for at least 12 h to allow imbibition. Subsequently, seeds
    were placed on petri dishes with agar to germinate and put into the greenhouse.
    Germination varied from 1 day to more than 4 weeks. Most species were planted
    into experimental pots within a week after root emergence from the seed, but a
    few species were kept on agar for longer because their root growth was very slow.
    Seedlings were grown for 20 weeks and then harvested. A maximum of 10 individuals
    per species were grown (individuals per species - range 5-10; average = 8.8; mode
    = 10) (actual replications provided in Table S3). Due to space limitations it
    was necessary to grow plants in three batches. Initially, we had intended only
    to run two batches of the experiment with even planting for each species in each
    batch. However, for numerous reasons (species sample size, seed availability and
    viability, species distribution across the associated phylogenetic tree (see Tomlinson
    et al. 2012)) we decided an additional batch would be necessary. This meant that
    species were grown in one batch (10 individuals) or two batches (five individuals
    per batch) of the three.

  notes: This data is a subset of the data presented in the manuscript, having extracted
    only the Australian species. AusTraits has changed the units for stomatal conductance
    from 'umol m-2 s-1' to 'mmol m-2 s-1'. Additional data measured on these same
    species is available in Tomlinson_2019.

  methods: Morphological traits were estimated per individual using the following
    procedure. At harvest time, up to six fully expanded fresh leaves were sampled
    from each plant. These were immediately scanned with a flatbed scanner (CanoScan
    LIDE 100; Canon, Tokyo, Japan) to obtain their surface area, weighed for their
    fresh weight, dried at 70 deg C for at least 48 h, and weighed for their dry weight.
    The remaining plant biomass was separated into organ fractions (cotyledon, leaf,
    stem, root), dried and weighed to obtain dry masses of cotyledon, leaf, stem,
    root and total (MT). Leaf mass fraction (LMF, g g-1) was calculated as plant leaf
    mass divided by plant total mass (MT).

    per individual using the following procedures. Dry mass-based estimates of leaf
    nutrient contents (Nm, Pm, Km, mg nutrient g-1) were estimated using a Skalar
    San-plus autoanalyzer after digestion with a mixture of H2SO4, Se and salicylic
    acid (Novozamsky et al. 1983).

  methods: Seedlings were harvested at 0, 5 and 20 weeks after planting to measure
    biomass allocation and root functional traits.We predicted species of semi-arid
    savannas to have greater RMF than species from humid savannas. Therefore, total
    seedling mass (g dry matter) and organ mass fractions of plants [g g)1 dry matter;
    leaf mass fraction (LMF); stem mass fraction (SMF); RMF] were estimated using
    plants harvested at 20 weeks. (Trait values from Tomlinson 2012.)
