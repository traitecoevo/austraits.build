  description: various traits for 18 Australian species
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: We sampled dominant or very abundant tree species from humid
    and semi-arid savannas in Africa, Australia and South America (previously described
    in Tomlinson et al. 2012). We identified semi-arid and humid environments using
    the Koppen-Geiger climate classification (Kottek et al. 2006). This system estimates
    the relative water deficits of particular locations by comparing a dryness threshold
    based on the mean annual temperature (Tann, °C) with MAP (mm) at those locations,
    adjusted for whether the region has predominantly winter or summer rainfall. Given
    a dryness threshold Pth = 28 + 2 (Tann), then semi-arid environments are defined
    in the range - 5 Pth < MAP < 10 Pth, and humid environments are defined as areas
    where MAP > 10 Pth. We sampled dominant or very abundant tree species from humid
    and semi-arid summer-rainfall savannas in southern Africa (coastal and inland
    savannas in South Africa and Zimbabwe) (Frost 1996; Mucina & Rutherford 2006),
    in north-eastern Australia (coastal and inland woodlands in Queensland) (Cole
    1986), and eastern South America (Cerrado and Caatinga biomes in Brazil) (Cole
    1986). Table S1 (Supporting Information) provides descriptive information for
    the sampled environments. The South American species were all sampled over low-fertility
    soils whereas the African and Australian species were sampled over a wider range
    of soil fertilities. A total of 51 species were grown, including 18 species from
    Australia (8 humid, 10 semi-arid), 21 species from Africa (10 humid, 11 semi-arid)
    and 12 species from South America (eight humid, four semi-arid). The species belonged
    to a wide variety of clades, representing nine plant orders, 13 families and 28
    genera. A full species list is provided in Table S2 (see Supporting Information),
    including their family, order, continent of origin, climate type of origin and
    leaf habit traits. The sampled species reflected continental biases in dominant
    plant families (Cole 1986) - Australian savannas are dominated by Myrtaceae and
    Fabaceae, African savannas are dominated by Combretaceae and Fabaceae, whereas
    humid South American savannas are composed of a large number of co-dominant families
    and semi-arid savannas are dominated by Fabaceae. Consequently, two plant orders
    (Fabales and Myrtales) formed the bulk of the species sample. GREENHOUSE EXPERIMENT
    We conducted a greenhouse experiment to evaluate the effect of leaf habit and
    climate type on traits of seedlings of the 51 savanna tree species selected from
    the three continents and grown in one common growth environment. We deliberately
    grew all species in a similar, favourable environment for a fair comparison of
    presumably genetically based (inherent) variation in the relevant traits. Plants
    were grown in a greenhouse chamber at Radix Research Farm, Wageningen University,
    The Netherlands (51°59'17''N, 5°39'45''E) between September 2008 and October 2010.
    Temperature in the greenhouse was set at 28 °C for 12 h (daytime) and 23 °C for
    12 h (night time). These temperatures were chosen to lie within the range of mean
    minimum temperatures (17.4–24.2 °C) and mean daily temperatures (24.8 –30.3 °C)
    during the warmest month of the locations where seed was collected for the experiments.
    Daily variation of light in the greenhouse was from 150 to 450 lmol m_2 s_1, supplied
    from sunshine and supplementary light. Supplementary light (150 lmol m_2 s_1)
    was provided for 12–16 h (seasonally adjusted) to ensure that the daily supply
    of photon flux density exceeded 10 mol m_2 day_1. Other studies have shown that
    the total daily photon flux density, rather than peak irradiance, is most important
    for plant growth (Poorter & Van der Werf 1998). Although the total amount of light
    is low by comparison with full sun environments in the tropics, plant growth was
    substantial in some species and varied substantially among species (Table S3 in
    Supporting Information; Tomlinson et al. 2012), indicating that available light
    was sufficient to distinguish growth abilities of different species. Tree seedlings
    were grown in plastic tubes of 10 cm diameter and 100 cm length, to reduce pot
    limitation of root growth. Pots were filled with river sand mixed with slow-release
    fertiliser [Osmocote 18-6-12 (N-P-K) fertilizer (8–9 month mixture)] at a concentration
    of 5 kg fertiliser m_3 river sand. We used a high level of fertility to facilitate
    maximum growth and differentiation among the species during the period of the
    experiment. Water was supplied through irrigation three times per day at a rate
    of 40 mL per pot per day, equivalent to 800 mm of rainfall over 20 weeks of growth.
    This was a much more even water supply than most of these species would receive
    in their natural environment, but the intention was to ensure that all the plants
    were wellwatered while they grew, so that water limitation did not contribute
    to any trait variation between species. Seeds were germinated for the experiment
    in the following manner - seed coats of hard-coated species were cut to allow water
    imbibition, and seeds of all species were soaked in distilled water for at least
    12 h to allow imbibition. Subsequently, seeds were placed on petri dishes with
    agar to germinate and put into the greenhouse. Germination varied from 1 day to
    more than 4 weeks. Most species were planted into experimental pots within a week
    after root emergence from the seed, but a few species were kept on agar for longer
    because their root growth was very slow. Seedlings were grown for 20 weeks and
    then harvested. A maximum of 10 individuals per species were grown (individuals
    per species - range 5–10; average = 8.8; mode = 10) (actual replications provided
    in Table S3). Due to space limitations it was necessary to grow plants in three
    batches. Initially, we had intended only to run two batches of the experiment
    with even planting for each species in each batch. However, for numerous reasons
    (species sample size, seed availability and viability, species distribution across
    the associated phylogenetic tree (see Tomlinson et al. 2012)) we decided an additional
    batch would be necessary. This meant that species were grown in one batch (10
    individuals) or two batches (five individuals per batch) of the three.

  methods: Morphological traits were estimated per individual using the following
    procedure. At harvest time, up to six fully expanded fresh leaves were sampled
    from each plant. These were immediately scanned with a flatbed scanner (CanoScan
    LIDE 100; Canon, Tokyo, Japan) to obtain their surface area, weighed for their
    fresh weight, dried at 70 °C for at least 48 h, and weighed for their dry weight.
    The remaining plant biomass was separated into organ fractions (cotyledon, leaf,
    stem, root), dried and weighed to obtain dry masses of cotyledon, leaf, stem,
    root and total (MT). Leaf mass fraction (LMF, g g_1) was calculated as plant leaf
    mass divided by plant total mass (MT).
