  description: A revision of Baeckea (Myrtaceae) in eastern Australia, Malesia and
    south-east Asia.
  collection_type: herbarium specimens
  sample_age_class: adult_assumed
  sampling_strategy: This study is based upon an examination of herbarium material
    from A, BM, BRI, CANB, G, GH, HAL, HO, K, L, MEL, NE, NSW and QRS, as well as
    photographs and microﬁche from K, LINN and G–DC. Most species have been seen in
    the ﬁeld to examine bark, habit and habitat, and to collect suitable ﬂoral material
    for later herbarium specimens.
