  description: The accumulation of nutrients by fruits of Grevillea wilsonii was studied
    throughout their development and the distribution of nutrients between fruit parts
    is described for G. wilsonii and Hakea undulata.
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: 'GREVILLEA WILSONII: I used a population of fairly uniform plants
    of Grevillea wilsonii, about 1 m high, which grew in jarrah woodland near the
    southern edge of Walyunga National Park, Darling Range, about 15 km east of Perth.
    The soil was ironstone gravel with a sandy matrix that had been derived from weathered
    lateritic duricrust (Beard 1979). The area lies within the 850-1000 mm rainfall
    isohyets, and the climate is classified as warm Mediterranean (Beard 1979). The
    site had not been burnt for at least 5 years and the plants had received no supplementary
    water or nutrients. Three representative samples each of 50-100 fruits were collected
    from the plants at approximately weekly intervals during the 9-week period from
    flowering to fruit maturity (mid November to late January). Fruits were enclosed
    in fine nylon mesh as they neared maturity, to collect seeds shed during dehiscence.
    Fruits were aged by tagging inflorescences at anthesis of their five first-formed
    (proximal) flowers; only fruits which developed from these flowers were used.
    Fruits which contained one or no seeds were rejected and replaced with ones with
    two seeds. HAKEA UNDULATA: For Hakea undulata, I used plants 1.5-2.5 m high which
    grew a short distance downslope from G. wilsonii on similar soil; there was some
    overlap in the distribution of the two species. Three representative samples each
    of 30 fruits of H. undulata were collected at the same time as those of G. wilsonii.
    However, H. undulata fruits, although still green, were almost full-sized when
    harvesting began. Three samples of 50 mature leaves were collected from near these
    fruits, as well as three samples of 50 young leaves from new vegetative growth.'

  trait_name: fruit_dry_mass

  methods: Fruits were separated into follicle or capsule and seeds with a stainless-steel
    knife, and their fresh and dry weights obtained before they were milled to a homogeneous
    powder.

  methods: Fruits were separated into follicle or capsule and seeds with a stainless-steel
    knife, and their fresh and dry weights obtained before they were milled to a homogeneous
    powder. Total nitrogen in plant parts was determined from Kjeldahl digests with
    a Technicon autoanalyser.
- var_in: fruit_P_mg_g-1

  trait_name: fruit_P_per_dry_mass
  value_type: site_mean
  replicates: 3
  methods: Fruits were separated into follicle or capsule and seeds with a stainless-steel
    knife, and their fresh and dry weights obtained before they were milled to a homogeneous
    powder. All nutrients other than N were determined after wet-ashing aliquots (250
    mg) of plant material in a mixture of nitric and perchloric acids as described
    by Johnson and Ulrich (1959). Total phosphorus was determined colorimetrically
    (Murphy and Riley 1962) and total sulfur as described by Allen et al. (1974).
