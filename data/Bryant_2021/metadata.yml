  description: Study characterising a novel foliar water uptake pathway and the influence
    of leaf wetting duration, wet-dry seasonality and leaf dehydration on leaf conductance
    to surface water (Ksurf) in two mangrove species of the Sonneratia genus.

  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: 2.1 Site description and study species ^p Plant material was
    sourced between November 2017 and October 2019 from naturally occurring trees
    on Daintree River, Daintree National Park, Far North Queensland, Australia. The
    study site is situated in the wet-dry tropics with ~80% of the rainfall occurring
    from November through May, long-term annual precipitation at the site is 2168
    ± 468 mm/year (M ± SD, 1968-2019; http://bom.gov.au/climate/data/ accessed March,
    2021). Two canopy forming mangrove tree species of the Sonneratia genus were studied,
    Sonneratia alba Sm. and S. caseolaris (L.) Engl., both with wide-spread distributions
    in the Indo West Pacific (Duke, 1992; Duke, Ball, & Ellison, 1998). These species
    differ in distributions along estuarine salinity gradients; S. alba can occupy
    habitats ranging from 5 to 100% seawater while the distribution of S. caseolaris
    spans 2-40% seawater (Duke et al., 1998). Sonneratia caseolaris material was collected
    from the upriver mangrove limit (16°15'29.7″ S 145°20'34.1″ E), while S. alba
    material was collected closer to the estuary mouth (16°17'24.8″ S 145°24'36.8″
    E). One branch was collected from each of 3-5 co-occurring trees of each species
    and transported to the lab in black plastic bags with moistened paper towel to
    prevent water loss. At time of branch collection, estuary surface water was measured
    using a hand-held refractometer (A.S.T. Co. Ltd., Japan). Salinities were averaged
    from five measurements. As Sonneratia species are predominantly distributed along
    the estuary margin in loosely consolidated sediments, estuary surface water salinities
    are representative of those experienced by roots (Ball & Pidsley, 1995; Duke et
    al., 1998). Osmotic potentials of estuarine water were calculated based on the
    fraction of sea water where standard sea water has a salinity of 35 ppt and an
    osmotic potential of -2.4 MPa. Estuarine water osmotic potential at time of sampling
    was -0.12 ± 0.01 MPa at upriver S. caseolaris sites (Noveber 2017), and varied
    between -1.41 ± 0.02 MPa in wet season (November 2017) and -1.61 ± 0.02 MPa in
    dry season (August 2018) at S. alba collection sites (M ± SD).

  methods: Rehydration kinetics associated with FWU pathways were assessed in S. alba
    only due to the short, flattened petioles of S. caseolaris making it difficult
    to measure water potential in intact leaves. The effect of seasonality on leaf
    conductance to surface water was assessed in S. alba in wet season (December 2017)
    and again in dry season (August 2018). Branches from wet season (n = 3) and dry
    season (n = 4) were transported back to the lab in black plastic and allowed to
    air dry for 4-5 hr, to achieve similar starting water potentials, -2.91 ± 0. 16
    MPa and -3.19 ± 0.08 MPa, for the wet and dry season respectively (M ± SD, F =
    0.069, p = .002, Two-tailed t test). After dehydration, branches were allowed
    to equilibrate in black plastic bags for 40 min. At 20:00 hr, nine pairs of mature
    healthy leaves, each sharing a single node were selected from each branch. The
    psi-leaf of one leaf from each leaf pair was measured using a Scholander pressure
    chamber (1050D, PMS Instrument Albany, USA) as a proxy for its partner and the
    fresh weight of the opposite leaf was measured. Weighed leaves' petioles were
    wrapped in Nesco-film to preclude water entry, and were then hung with delicate
    clothes pegs on a dowel rod spanning a clear, 50 L polypropylene chamber. Leaves
    were subjected to a wetting treatment using a spraying bottle until all leaf surfaces
    and chamber walls were wet. Additionally, the chamber was filled with 5 cm of
    water with several wads of sponge placed semi-emerged in the water to increase
    evaporative surface area and maintain humidity. Rehydration kinetics of leaves
    were assessed at eight intervals (t = 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 hr). Following
    wetting exposure, leaves were removed from the chamber, excess surface water was
    removed by blotting with a paper towel, then leaves were measured for change in
    fresh mass and change in psi-. Leaf area was then measured using a flatbed scanner
    (LiDE scan 110, Canon, Sydney, Australia) and ImageJ (Schneider, Rasband, & Eliceiri,
    2012). To maintain leaf surface wetting of leaves remaining in the chamber, leaf
    surfaces were re-misted seven times over a 12 hr period, that is, every time the
    chamber was opened for resampling. See manuscript for calculation of foliar water
    uptake (FWU; mol H2O/m2).

  methods: The effect of leaf dehydration on leaf conductance to surface water was
    assessed in S. alba in leaves sampled in April 2019. Large branches, cut from
    five different trees (n = 5), were each split into three smaller branches, each
    of which were subject to one of three statistically distinct dehydration treatments
    differing in initial psi-leaf. -1.82 ± 0.20, -2.26 ± 0.09, -3.81 ± 1.49 MPa (M
    ± SD, F8 = 533.41, p < .001, one-way repeated measures ANOVA). Water relations
    between early and late dry season have been characterized by for S. alba at this
    study site previously (Bryant et al., 2021). The dehydration levels selected in
    the present study span the expected points of bulk leaf turgor loss, measured
    as -2.9 ± 0.1 MPa and -3.4 ± 0.1 MPa during early and late dry season, respectively,
    as well as water potentials associated with 50% stomatal closure, -3.10 ± 0.15
    MPa, and approaching 88% stomatal closure, ~ -4.10 MPa (Bryant et al., 2021).
    After dehydration, branches were allowed to equilibrate in black plastic bags
    for 40 min. Foliar water uptake rehydration kinetics were measured using the same
    protocol as seasonality FWU kinetics, however, with only four leaf pairs from
    each branch arrayed over an 8 hr period (t = 2, 4, 6, 8 hr).
