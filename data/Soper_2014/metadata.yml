  sampling_strategy: 'Species in three prominent plant families were sampled at four
    sites along the transect: (1) diazotrophic, arbuscular/ ecto-mycorrhizal Acacia
    species (Fabaceae, including Acacia shirleyi Maiden, A. kempeana F. Muell., A.
    aneura F. Muell. ex Benth., A. lysiphloia F. Muell., A. trachyphloia Tindale,
    A. neurocarpa A. Cunn. ex Hook, A. holosericea, A. Cunn. ex G. Don and A. auriculiformis
    A. Cunn. ex Benth.); (2) arbuscular/ecto-mycorrhizal Eucalyptus and Corymbia species
    (Myrtaceae, including Eucalyptus capricornia D.J. Carr & S.G.M. Carr, E. terminalis
    F. Muell., E. chlorophylla Brooker & Done, E. patellaris F. Muell., E. tetrodonta
    F. Muell., E. miniata Cunn. ex Schauer, C. foelscheana F. Muell., C. greeniana
    D.J. Carr & S.G.M. Carr and C. dichromophloia F. Muell.); and (3) non-mycorrhizal
    Hakea, Grevillea and Persoonia species (Proteaceae, including Hakea lorea R. Br.,
    H. arborescens R. Br., Grevillea wickhamii Meisn., G. pteridifolia Knight, G.
    dimidiata F. Muell, G. striata R. Br. and Persoonia falcata R. Br.). At each site,
    4-14 individual trees representing 2-4 species from each of the three plant families
    were sampled for foliage and shoot and root xylem sap.'

  methods: At each site, 4-14 individual trees representing 2-4 species from each
    of the three plant families were sampled for foliage and shoot and root xylem
    sap. Xylem samples taken from the same individual trees in March-April and August
    2003 were pooled for analysis due to low sample volume. Xylem sap was extracted
    from canopy branches and roots of approximately 1 cm diameter with a handheld
    vacuum pump (Pate et al. 1994). Lateral roots were traced from the trunk outward
    until they narrowed to ~1 cm diameter in the top 0-30 cm, with most roots occurring
    in the top 10 cm. Each branch or root yielded 200-1,500 -l sap. Samples were immediately
    transferred into 1.5 ml O-ring tubes and stored in liquid N2. Upon return to the
    laboratory, samples were stored at -80 deg C and analysed for amino acids, NH4+
    and NO3- as per Schmidt and Stewart (1998). A subsample of xylem sap was pipetted
    into tin cups and freeze-dried in portions of 0.1 cm3 to yield sufficient N for
    d15N analysis via continuous flow isotope ratio mass spectrometry (Tracer Mass,
    routine precision 0.2 - SD; Europa Scientific, now PDZ Europa,Sandbach, UK).
