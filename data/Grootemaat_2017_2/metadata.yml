  description: For upscaling from leaf traits to wildfire behaviour one needs to know
    if the same leaf traits are important for the flammability of 1) individual leaves,
    and 2) multiple leaves packed in fuel beds. This study tested whether the fuel
    packing properties, through airflow limitation, overruled the effects of individual
    leaf morphology and chemistry.
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: To compare the flammability of individual leaves with the flammability
    in fuel beds, species were used as replicate, and the same evergreen perennial
    species were used as in Grootemaat et al. (2015). However, for some species it
    was unrealistic to collect enough material and therefore we ended up using a subset
    of 25 species (out of 32; see Supplementary material Appendix 1 Table A2 for the
    species list). Species were selected at four different sites in New South Wales,
    eastern Australia (previously used and described by Wright et al. 2001). Two sites
    were located in Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park, Sydney (average annual rainfall
    1233 mm; Australian Bureau of Meteorology); two other sites were located in the
    drier Round Hill Nature Reserve (570 km inland from Sydney; average annual rainfall
    383 mm). Within each rainfall zone there was a site with higher nutrient soil
    (phosphorus levels > 250 ug g-1) and one with lower nutrient soil (phosphorus
    levels < 132 ug g-1). By dispersing sampling across these four different sites
    and vegetation types (closed forest; open forest; dry open woodland; mallee woodland)
    we ended up with a species set covering 13 families, with a variety of growth
    forms (trees, shrubs, a cycad and a hummock grass) and a wide interspecific range
    of leaf traits (Supplementary material Appendix 1 Table A3). ^p  As our model-material
    for the fuel beds we used air-dried leaves, either collected while still green
    (25 species) or collected when freshly senesced (10 species). Since Australian
    plants do not shed their leaves en masse in autumn, as is common for deciduous
    species of the northern hemisphere, it is difficult to estimate how long senesced
    leaves have been on the forest floor. The stage of decomposition can affect the
    flammability (Zhao et al. 2014) and to eliminate this variation we chose to work
    on senesced leaves freshly collected from the plants (the ease of detachment indicated
    the presence of an abscission layer) or on recently-fallen leaves which were identified
    based on their colour and lack of decomposition signs. In parallel we used green
    leaves freshly picked from the branches because 1) they also contribute to surface
    fuel beds (after being knocked off by storms or by animals), 2) it was relatively
    easy to collect adequate amounts of green material for most of the species and
    3) because it suited the purpose of this study, namely comparing the flammability
    of individual leaves with the flammability of fuel beds. After transport to the
    laboratory in paper bags, the leaves were spread out on benches and air-dried
    for three weeks until they reached equilibrium weight with the prevalent room
    temperature (21 deg C). The leaves were sent in cardboard boxes to VU University
    where they were air-dried in paper bags for another two weeks in a temperature
    controlled room (21 deg C).

  methods: Fire duration; time from ignition at a sensor until the fire dies out at
    that sensor (mean of 5 sensors, threshold used is 50 deg C). Overall, experimental
    burns were performed on monospecific fuel beds consisting of air-dried senesced
    leaves or air-dried green leaves. The experiments were run in the Fire Laboratory
    of Amsterdam for Research in Ecology (FLARE), at VU University in Amsterdam, the
    Netherlands. The fuel beds were burned following the procedure as described by
    van Altena et al. (2012). In short, on the days before the experimental burns,
    the samples, which were all at equilibrium moisture content under ambient lab-conditions,
    were weighed and sealed in plastic bags to keep the moisture content constant
    until the time of burning. Each bag was opened shortly before the burn and the
    air-dried leaves were placed loosely in a steel mesh ring (25 cm in diameter,
    3 cm high). The leaves were equally distributed over the ring until the ring was
    full, resulting in an equal fuel bed volume for all replicates (1473 cm3 ). The
    number of replicates for each species depended on the availability of material
    (Supplementary material Appendix 1 Table A2). For some species we only had enough
    material for one replicate, but, since the replicates 'within' species were pseudo-replicates,
    and the mean values for fuel beds 'between' species were true replicates, this
    was not a problem for our experimental design. The burns were blocked in time,
    so that one sample of each species was burned in random order on a particular
    day. This would prevent any systematic effects of changes in relative humidity
    and temperature in FLARE during the experiments. The filled ring was placed on
    a fire-resistant plate beneath a fume hood with a constant moderate draft. Samples
    were ignited by lighting a cotton disk (folded twice), injected with 1 ml of ethanol
    (96%), which was placed in the middle of the ring. Six thermocouples (1 mm type
    K) were positioned approximately 1 cm above the leaves. One of these thermocouples
    was located above the centre of the ring, while the tips of the other five thermocouples
    were equally distributed around the ring with a distance of 6.25 cm from the ring's
    centre. Temperature was logged every second. The flammability parameters that
    were measured during each burn included ignition frequency (%), maximum temperature
    (deg C), rate of spread (cm s-1 ), point burning time (s) and fuel consumption
    (% mass loss) (Supplementary material Appendix 1 Table A1).
