  description: angiosperm and gymnosperm dispersal data from Si-Chong Chen PhD
  collection_type: literature
  sample_age_class: adult_assumed
  sampling_strategy: A list of Australian plant species was obtained from the 'Flora of Australia online database' (Flora of Australia online 2009). Hybrids, aquatic species and naturalised species were removed from the dataset. We checked the nomenclature against the 'Taxonomic Name Resolution Service ver. 3.2' (Boyle et al. 2013). Outdated synonyms were corrected and incorrect species with no clear synonyms were removed. We categorized the fruit of each species as either fleshy or non-fleshy according to species descriptions in the 'Flora of Australia online database' (Flora of Australia online 2009). For species that lacked fruit information in 'Flora of Australia online', we referred to descriptions in other sources, including FloraBase (Western Australian Herbarium 1998), PLantNET (The Royal Botanic Gardens and Domain Trust 1999) and the database of Australian tropical rainforest plants (Centre for Australian National Biodiversity Research 2010).

  notes: Original species names assigned follow the species nomenclatures in the Flora of Australia Online.

  methods: We categorized the fruit of each species as either fleshy or non-fleshy according to species descriptions in the 'Flora of Australia online database' (Flora of Australia online 2009). For species that lacked fruit information in 'Flora of Australia online', we referred to descriptions in other sources, including FloraBase (Western Australian Herbarium 1998), PLantNET (The Royal Botanic Gardens and Domain Trust 1999) and the database of Australian tropical rainforest plants (Centre for Australian National Biodiversity Research 2010). Fruits were defined in a functional manner, as dispersal units, including true fruits (e.g. Beilschmiedia recurva), accessory fruits (such as the receptacle in Semecarpus australiensis or the receptacle in Podocarpus) and appendages (e.g. the sarcotesta in Cycads). Fruits were classified as fleshy if they possessed conspicuous fleshy pericarps or fleshy appendages when mature (e.g. aril, thalamus, receptacle, calyx, rachis or bract or succulent pedicel); otherwise, they were classified as non-fleshy (this functional definition is similar to that used by Willson et al. 1989, Chen and Moles 2015).
