  description: angiosperm and gymnosperm dispersal data from Si-Chong Chen PhD
  basis_of_record: literature
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: A list of Australian plant species was obtained from the 'Flora
    of Australia online database' (Flora of Australia online 2009). Hybrids, aquatic
    species and naturalised species were removed from the dataset. We checked the
    nomenclature against the 'Taxonomic Name Resolution Service ver. 3.2' (Boyle et
    al. 2013). Outdated synonyms were corrected and incorrect species with no clear
    synonyms were removed. We categorized the fruit of each species as either fleshy
    or non-fleshy according to species descriptions in the 'Flora of Australia online
    database' (Flora of Australia online 2009). For species that lacked fruit information
    in 'Flora of Australia online', we referred to descriptions in other sources,
    including FloraBase (Western Australian Herbarium 1998), PLantNET (The Royal Botanic
    Gardens and Domain Trust 1999) and the database of Australian tropical rainforest
    plants (Centre for Australian National Biodiversity Research 2010).
  original_file: seed_fruit_data.xls; and also an original file for the Gymnosperm
    data.
  notes: Original species names assigned follow the species nomenclatures in the Flora
    of Australia Online.

    in a functional manner, as dispersal units, including true fruits (e.g. Beilschmiedia
    recurva), accessory fruits (such as the receptacle in Semecarpus australiensis
    or the receptacle in Podocarpus) and appendages (e.g. the sarcotesta in Cycads).
    Fruits were classified as fleshy if they possessed conspicuous fleshy pericarps
    or fleshy appendages when mature (e.g. aril, thalamus, receptacle, calyx, rachis
    or bract or succulent pedicel); otherwise, they were classified as non-fleshy
    (this functional definition is similar to that used by Willson et al. 1989, Chen
    and Moles 2015).

questions:
  contributor: Proteaceae have among the shortest fruit lengths in this study - that
    surprises us - is this data correct?
