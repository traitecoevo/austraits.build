  description: Dataset examining the growth versus shade tolerance trade-off
  collection_type: glasshouse field
  sample_age_class: seedling sapling
  sampling_strategy: "Seedlings of common species from each substrate type were obtained
    from a commercial nursery: six species characteristic of basalt, and five of rhyolite.
    We aimed to include species that represented the range of shade tolerance and
    growth rates present in assemblages on the two substrates (Table 2). Accordingly,
    we selected some species from among those that were well represented by juveniles
    in shaded understories (e.g. Argyrodendron trifoliolatum on basalt, Cryptocarya
    glaucescens on rhyolite), as well as the most common of those regenerating mainly
    on recently disturbed sites (e.g. Polyscias elegans on basalt, Callicoma serratifolia
    on rhyolite), and some that were common in environments with intermediate light
    (e.g. Diploglottis australis on basalt, Cryptocarya rigida on rhyolite). As relative
    growth rates decline during ontogeny (Evans 1972; Walters et al. 1993), we aimed
    to minimise initial size variation across the 10 species (Table 2).  The experiment
    was carried out in a glasshouse at University of New England, Armidale, New South
    Wales (30_300S, 151_390E; elevation 980m amsl). Plants were grown in 1-L pots
    filled with washed river sand. Nutrients were supplied in the form of 10 g Osmocote
    Plus (Scotts Australia, Bella Vista, NSW, Australia) slow-release fertiliser per
    pot. Pots were watered to field capacity twice weekly. Positions of individual
    pots were randomly assigned to positions on benches. Temperatures in the glasshouse
    ranged from 12 to 28_C, being regulated by an evaporative cooling system and under-floor
    heating. Light levels on the benches averaged ~15% of those measured outside the
    glasshouse. ^p  Stem growth of 9-12 seedlings per species was measured over ~250
    days, from early February until late October in 2012. Stem basal diameter2_length
    scales closely with whole-plant biomass (Kohyama and Hotta 1990,so changes in
    these dimensions of the main stem of each seedling were used as a proxy for growth
    of the whole plant (Baltzer and Thomas 2007). Stem volume was modelled as pr2_length,
    and relative growth rates of stem volume (RGRvol) were estimated.  ^p  To relate
    growth to initial biomass distribution parameters, four to nine extra seedlings
    of each species were harvested at the start of this growth period and separated
    into leaf, stem and root fractions. Leaf area was determined using a flatbed scanner
    with ASSESS 2.0 image analysis software (American Phytopathological Society),
    enabling estimation of initial specific leaf area (SLA) and leaf area ratio (LAR);
    as determinants of the efficiency of light interception at wholeplant level, SLA
    and LAR often correlate strongly with seedling relative growth rates (e.g. Lambers
    and Poorter 1992; Cornelissen et al. 1996; Veneklaas and Poorter 1998). Plant
    material was dried at 65_C for 48 h before determining dry weights. At the end
    of the growth period, all remaining live seedlings were harvested. Mortality reduced
    the final sample sizes of Callicoma serratifolia, Flindersia schottiana and Diploglottis
    australis to seven each, but growth and data were eventually obtained from at
    least nine individuals of all other species."

    description: "In northern New South Wales, rainforest occurs widely on both nutrient-rich basaltic soils and poorer rhyolitic soils (Baur 1957; Turner and Kelly 1981). The soils derived from basalt have much higher levels of total phosphorus, and although total nitrogen levels differ much less, carbon : nitrogen ratios are also much more favourable on soils developed from basalt (Table 1). Other important differences identified by Turner and Kelly (1981) include much higher exchangeable calcium in basaltic soils, and lower exchangeable aluminium. Rainforests on basalt and rhyolite in this region correspond to the 'complex notophyll vine forest' and 'simple notophyll vine forest' structural types recognised by Webb (1968). Although some species are common to both substrates, we focus here on specialists that are strongly associated with one or the other."

  methods: The 10th percentile of the distribution of each species in relation to
    light availability (mean daily photon flux density, PPFD10%) was used as an index
    of the minimum light level tolerated by each species (cf. Lusk and Reich 2000;
    Lusk et al. 2010). Shade-tolerant species such as Argyrodendron trifoliolatum
    have low PPFD10% values, whereas light-demanding species such as Polyscias elegans
    have high PPFD10% values (Table 2). Sampling was carried out on transects run
    through both second-growth and old-growth stands, and included forest margins
    and tree-fall gaps. Naturally occurring saplings with an initial height of 40<U+FFFD>120
    cm were selected randomly across as wide a range of light environments as possible,
    with sampling carried out along forest margins as well as within forest stands.
    A Nikon Coolpix 4500 digital camera (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) and an EC-08 fisheye
    adaptor was used to take hemispherical photographs above each individual, with
    the top of the camera oriented north. Photos were taken when trees were tagged
    and when final growth measurements were made, and the average PPFD value was used
    in analyses to account for any changes in light regime over the course of the
    study. Photos were analysed using the Gap Light Analyzer ver. 2.0 software package
    (Frazer et al. 1999) to obtain the mean daily PPFD transmittance above each sapling.
    Cloudiness, spectral fraction and beam fraction (Frazer et al. 1999) were estimated
    using MODIS satellite photos to quantify the frequency of cloud cover above our
    main worksites on basalt (28_3705200S, 153_2001900E) and rhyolite (28_3704300S,
    153_2105400E) (cf. Lusk et al. 2013b).
