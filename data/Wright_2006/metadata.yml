  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: Sampling strategy from manuscript, although only a subset of
    data are submitted, presumably because other data have been submitted independently
    by referenced authors- All study sites (Table 1) were dominated by evergreen woody
    perennials and located in nature reserves. 'Site' is used relatively loosely here.
    Several patches of nearby, similar vegetation with different times since the last
    fire were sampled at Myall (Falster and Westoby 2005b); two patches of similar
    vegetation with different times since the last fire were sampled at Ash (Falster
    and Westoby, unpublished); the tropical rainforest (TRF) 'site' actually consisted
    of two geographically separated subsites. As in the original study (Falster and
    Westoby 2005a), these were treated as one site because many species were common
    to the two subsites and the vegetation at both is similar complex mesophyll vine
    forest (Webb 1968). Mean annual rainfall and temperature varied considerably among
    the eight sites (Table 1). Seasonality of rainfall also varied, TRF (to the north)
    receiving most rain over the warmer months, Ash (to the south) over the colder
    months and the other sites showing weak seasonality in rainfall, where any. All
    species sampled were locally common evergreen trees or shrubs, except for four
    herbaceous species (two at Ash, two at Myall). The dataset represented 175 different
    species from 39 families and 21 orders (higher delineations from Angiosperm Phylogeny
    Group; http://www.mobot.org/MOBOT/ research/APweb/; accessed May 2005). The most
    strongly represented families were Myrtaceae, Proteaceae and Fabaceae (sensu lato),
    together contributing 93 species.

  methods: WD was measured at 250-mm distance by Falster and Westoby. Pickup et al.
    measured WD at 10 mm2 sapwood crosssectional area for all species, but WD could
    also be interpolated to 250 mm distance for species at the GLP site. WD was measured
    on stem segments 40–70 mm in length, following standard methods (Pickup et al.
    2005).

  trait_name: leaf_area
  value_type: site_mean
  replicates: unknown
  methods: Four to five fully expanded leaves were sampled from each individual plant
    to calculate average leaf size and SLA values (leaf area measured on a flatbed
    scanner); these were then averaged to calculate species-mean values (in total
    15–20 leaves were sampled per species).
