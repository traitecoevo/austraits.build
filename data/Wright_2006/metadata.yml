  description: hydraulic trait from 2006 Physiologica Plantarum paper
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: Sampling strategy from manuscript, although only a subset of
    data are submitted, presumably because other data have been submitted independently
    by referenced authors- All study sites (Table 1) were dominated by evergreen woody
    perennials and located in nature reserves. 'Site' is used relatively loosely here.
    Several patches of nearby, similar vegetation with different times since the last
    fire were sampled at Myall (Falster and Westoby 2005b); two patches of similar
    vegetation with different times since the last fire were sampled at Ash (Falster
    and Westoby, unpublished); the tropical rainforest (TRF) 'site' actually consisted
    of two geographically separated subsites. As in the original study (Falster and
    Westoby 2005a), these were treated as one site because many species were common
    to the two subsites and the vegetation at both is similar complex mesophyll vine
    forest (Webb 1968). Mean annual rainfall and temperature varied considerably among
    the eight sites (Table 1). Seasonality of rainfall also varied, TRF (to the north)
    receiving most rain over the warmer months, Ash (to the south) over the colder
    months and the other sites showing weak seasonality in rainfall, where any. All
    species sampled were locally common evergreen trees or shrubs, except for four
    herbaceous species (two at Ash, two at Myall). The dataset represented 175 different
    species from 39 families and 21 orders (higher delineations from Angiosperm Phylogeny
    Group; http://www.mobot.org/MOBOT/ research/APweb/; accessed May 2005). The most
    strongly represented families were Myrtaceae, Proteaceae and Fabaceae (sensu lato),
    together contributing 93 species.

  notes: The majority of data in the 'original_file' and analysed in the manuscript
    were first published in other papers and are in those datasets. The only data
    included here is data collected by Daniel Falster at the "Ash" site in Victoria,
    which is otherwise unpublished. The data in the file from site "TRF" are in Falster_2005_1,
    together with additional nutrient data and seed mass data. The data in the file
    from site 'myall' are in Falster_2005_2. The data in the file from the two Gosford
    sites are in Pickup_2005, and data from Round Hill woodland and mallee are in
    Wright_2002.

traits:
- var_in: Stem wood density
  unit_in: mg/mm3
  trait_name: wood_density
  value_type: site_mean
  replicates: unknown
  methods: WD was measured at 250-mm distance by Falster and Westoby. Pickup et al.
    measured WD at 10 mm2 sapwood crosssectional area for all species, but WD could
    also be interpolated to 250 mm distance for species at the GLP site. WD was measured
    on stem segments 40-70 mm in length, following standard methods (Pickup et al.
    2005).
- var_in: wd_1000
  unit_in: mg/mm3
  trait_name: wood_density
  value_type: site_mean
  replicates: unknown
  methods: These wood density values would have been measured on segments 1000 mm
    in length, following standard methods.
- var_in: leaf size
  unit_in: mm2
  trait_name: leaf_area
  value_type: site_mean
  replicates: 4-5
  methods: Four to five fully expanded leaves were sampled from each individual plant
    to calculate average leaf size and SLA values (leaf area measured on a flatbed
    scanner); these were then averaged to calculate species-mean values (in total
    15-20 leaves were sampled per species).
- var_in: SLA
  unit_in: mm2/mg
  trait_name: specific_leaf_area
  value_type: site_mean

  methods: Four to five fully expanded leaves were sampled from each individual plant
    to calculate average leaf size and SLA values (leaf area measured on a flatbed
    scanner); these were then averaged to calculate species-mean values (in total
    15-20 leaves were sampled per species).
- var_in: LA/SA10
  unit_in: mm2_leaf/mm2_sapwood
  trait_name: huber_value
  value_type: site_mean
  replicates: unknown
  methods: 'Leaf area was determined for a shoot whose sapwood had a cross sectional
    area of 10 mm2. In detail, No single best point exists to compare traits such
    as LM/ SM, LA/SM and LA/SA when considering a set of species that varies widely
    in canopy architecture and typical maximum height (here, approximately 20 cm to
    85 m). We have used several approaches (Table 1). In one study, we made measurements
    on the terminal twigs of each species, i.e. on a relatively standard developmental
    unit (Westoby and Wright 2003). For species at Ash, GLP, Myall and TRF, traits
    were measured at each of several different distances back down the stem from the
    branch tip (Falster and Westoby 2005a, 2005b and unpublished, Pickup et al. 2005).
    At GHP, RHM and RHW, traits were measured at a standard sapwood cross-sectional
    area (10 mm2; Pickup et al. 2005). For the present re-analysis, we took the raw
    data from the previous studies and, for every species possible, calculated patterns
    of leaf and stem deployment at two standard points: at 250 mm distance from the
    branch tip (Ash, GLP, Myall and TRF) and at 10 mm2 stem (Ash, Myall, TRF) or sapwood
    (GHP, GLP, RHM, RHW) crosssectional area (250 mm or 10 mm2 formulation denoted
    as subscript in trait abbreviations). This was done as follows. For each individual
    plant, total leaf and stem dry mass at 250 mm distance was estimated by straightline
    interpolation from values measured at the nearest sampling points on either side
    of this distance. As the dry mass data tended to display non-linear (power) relationships
    with distance from the branch tip, the interpolated values were calculated from
    log10-log10- transformed data, then back-transformed to the original scale. The
    same approach was used for interpolating data to the standard stem (or sapwood)
    cross-sectional area. For individuals where measurements had not been made on
    either side of the desired point but the nearest measurement had been made within
    25 mm of 250 mm or 1 mm2 of 10 mm2 cross-section (i.e. within 10% of the desired
    point), we extrapolated (rather than interpolated) the measured data to the standard
    point. This allowed us to include a number of individuals and species for which
    interpolation was not possible. Still, several large-leaved, large-stemmed species
    from the TRF site could not be included in the 10-mm2 crosssection dataset. No
    unusual tendencies in analyses, including the extrapolated data, were seen in
    comparison to analyses including interpolated data only (details not shown). To
    illustrate how species'' morphology varied at the two standard sampling points,
    species-mean stem cross-sectional area varied between 1.2 and 258 mm2 at 250 mm
    distance from the branch tip, while the distance from the branch tip at which
    stem cross-sectional area reached 10 mm2 varied from 64 to 995 mm.'
