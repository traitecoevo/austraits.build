  description: Study in Kosciuszko National Park to investigate how vegetation composition
    in snowpatches changed over six years. Differences in functional composition between
    survey periods were determined using functional traits (plant height, percent
    leaf dry matter content and specific leaf area) to calculate community trait-weighted
    means.
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: This study was conducted across seven snowpatches of the Main
    Range in the alpine area of Kosciuszko National Park, the Snowy Mountains, south-eastern
    Australia. The alpine area is characterized by snow cover for approximately 4-5
    months of the year, with the first snow contributing to the winter snowpack usually
    occurring between May and June. Snow cover becomes discontinuous in October, although
    large drifts along the highest ridgelines may persist until March or later. Cumulative
    snow depth and thaw date for the past 60 years from the nearby weekly monitored
    snow course at Spencers Creek (1,830 m, 5 km from the study sites), show high
    inter-annual variability, with the integrated snow profile ranging from 63 to
    439 metre-days, and the date of thaw ranging from day 278 to 348 of year (Fig.
    1). However, there is an overall trend of declining snow cover and earlier thaws
    over the past 60 years (Fig. 1). In addition, the 2007 survey occurred during
    the longest drought period on record in Australia with higher than average temperatures,
    lower precipitation (BOM 2013), shallow snow cover and earlier snow thaw (Green
    and Pickering 2009b). In contrast, conditions before the 2013 survey were wetter
    with more snow and a later thaw (BOM 2013). Hence, the vegetation would have experienced
    a shorter, but wetter growing period before the resurvey in 2013 compared to 2007.
    Snowpatches in this region are considered to be discrete habitats within the alpine
    area, which reflect differences in abiotic conditions including soil depth, nutrients
    and temperatures, duration of the growing season and amount of rock cover (Costin
    1954; Green and Pickering 2009b). For example, although highly organic alpine
    humus soils dominate all bedrock types and under most physiographic conditions
    within this alpine area (Costin 1954), soils were shallower and there was more
    exposed loose rock on the surface in the centre of the snowpatches than in areas
    immediately down slope where soils were deeper and there was less exposed loose
    rock (Green and Pickering 2009b).  Vegetation sampling The seven snowpatches sampled
    are among the latest lying in Australia, and are well defined and localized within
    an area of 20 km2 (Supplementary Material 1). Plant composition was recorded in
    the seven snowpatches using permanently marked 1 m2 quadrats in March 2007 and
    March 2013, following the protocols outlined in Green and Pickering (2009a). Quadrats
    were allocated to the centre of the snowpatches where snow lies the latest and
    is frequently bare ground and rock with occasional plants, some characteristic
    of Snowbank Feldmark. Down slope from the centre of the snowpatch in Short Alpine
    Herbfield, where it is less rocky and there is wet snowpatch meadow soils and
    poor fen peats resulting even though snowmelt is still relatively late and in
    Tall Alpine Herbfield further down slope from the snowpatch centre where snowmelt
    is even earlier and soils deeper. Between these three zones defined by plant communities,
    narrow transition zones were recognized.

questions:
  contributor: A few of the SLA values are extreme outliers and I am wondering if
    for a few species something is off with the units for either leaf area or leaf
    dry mass. In particular, Colobanthus pulvinatus has a specific leaf area that
    is nearly 10x lower than any other species in your study (0.45 mm2/mg), while
    Senecio pinnatifolius var. pleiocephalus (194 mm2/mg) Aciphylla simplicifolia
    (264), and Psychrophile introloba (Caltha introloba) (376) have by far the highest
    SLA values in AusTraits. In addition, Diplaspis nivis (21381) and Plantago euryphylla
    (1269) have been excluded as having SLA values outside allowable trait limits.
    Since most species have completely "normal" SLA values I'm fairly certain the
    assigned units are correct. Should I just exclude the outliers?
