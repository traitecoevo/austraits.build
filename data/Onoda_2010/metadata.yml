  description: A study on 32 plant species growing across four sites of contrasting
    rainfall and soil nutrient availability in Australia to investigate variation
    in stem mechanics across species and habitats.
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: Site and species selection Field sites were located in a relatively
    high-rainfall climate at Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park near Sydney on Australia's
    east coast, and in a low-rainfall zone c. 500 km west of Sydney at Round Hill
    Nature Reserve (Table 1). Two sites differing in soil nutrient availability were
    chosen within each rainfall zone (Wright et al., 2002). All sites fell along a
    common latitudinal band (mean annual temperature 17.5 deg C), and experienced
    aseasonal patterns of rainfall. Eight evergreen tree and shrub species were sampled
    at each site giving a total of 32 species from 12 plant families (Table 2). Species
    were chosen from comprehensive species lists for each site to ensure a diverse
    representation of plant families and growth forms. Although species selection
    was not strictly random, the selection procedure did ensure that the dominant
    species of each community were represented. Samples of stem (from the terminal
    axis of the main branch) at 4-6 mm sapwood diameter from the outer canopy were
    removed from five individuals of each species at each site. This diameter was
    chosen for consistency with other studies of the same species that used 10 mm2
    sapwood cross-sectional area as a standard measurement point (Pickup et al., 2005).
    Samples were stored in sealed plastic bags with a piece of moist paper towel in
    cool conditions and analysed within 2 wk of collection. All samples were collected
    between February and April 2008.

  unit_in: mm
  trait_name: bark_thickness
  entity_type: individual
  value_type: raw
  basis_of_value: measurement
  replicates: 1
  methods: Bark thickness was calculated from the difference in diameter between whole
    stems and those with bark removed (sapwood only) divided by two; the measurements
    for bark thickness are on the smaller side of the ditribution because the study
    used small branches (4-6 mm diameter branches) rather than the trunk for bark
    measurements.

  entity_type: individual
  value_type: raw
  basis_of_value: measurement

  methods: Calculations made on sapwood; The stem samples taken from the field were
    divided into two subsamples for measurement of wood density and mechanical properties.
    One subsample was measured intact, while the other subsample was measured after
    removal of the outer bark, phloem and cambium layers (hereafter collectively called
    'bark') by hand. The cross-sectional area of the resulting 'sapwood' subsample
    included the pith. However, visual inspection suggested there was very little
    pith in our samples except for stem samples of Astrotricha floccosa. For each
    stem section we measured diameters at the midpoint and at each end, length, fresh
    weight, fresh volume and dry weight (after oven-drying at 60 deg C for at least
    5 d). The volume of each stem section was measured as the volume of water (cm3)
    displaced in a graduated measuring cylinder after complete submersion of the stem.
    Stem sections were saturated before measuring the volume to prevent uptake of
    water into the stem during measurement. Fresh wood density (fresh, g cm-3) and
    dry wood density (dry, g cm-3) were calculated by dividing the dry and fresh weight
    of stem sections by their fresh (green) volume.

  methods: Calculations made on sapwood; Young's MOE and MOR were measured on both
    intact stems and sapwood with three-point bending tests using a general materials
    testing machine (Model 5542; Instron Corporation, Canton, MA, USA). Stem specimens
    were placed on two supports, generally 120 mm apart, with a vertical force applied
    to the middle of the stem at a speed of 25 mm min-1. The span was > 20 times longer
    than the stem diameter for all cases. The MOE was calculated from the linear,
    elastic region of the relationship between load (F, N) and deflection (d, mm)
    (Gere & Timoshenko, 1999); see cited manuscript from equations used.
