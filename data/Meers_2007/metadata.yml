  description: A study aimed to determine whether trade-offs in plant design exist
    in sclerophyllous vegetation in Australia.
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: The Delatite Peninsula is located on the northern slopes of the
    Great Dividing Range in north-eastern Victoria, Australia (37 deg 8'S, 145 deg
    58'E), and has a steeply dissected topography, with altitude ranging from 300
    to 500m above sea level. Underlying parent materials are siltstones and sandstones
    of Late Silurian to Early Devonian age (Thomas 1947). The predominant soil types
    are yellow podsols (Rundle 1977; classification and approximation equivalents
    follow Moore et al. 1983). Annual rainfall is ~850mm and falls mainly in winter
    and spring (Bureau of Meteorology climate averages for Eildon, 1887-2003; www.bom.gov.au).
    Mean monthly maximum temperature ranges from 12.0 deg C in July to 29.0 deg C
    in February, with corresponding mean monthly minimum temperatures ranging from
    3.5 deg C to 12.5 deg C. The original vegetation was an open forest (Specht 1981)
    dominated by Eucalyptus dives, E. goniocalyx, E. macrorhyncha and E. polyanthemos,
    with a sparse understorey of shrubs, grasses and herbs. As a result of changing
    land use, the Delatite Peninsula currently includes a mosaic of native forests,
    abandoned farmland, Pinus radiata plantations and recently harvested plantations
    (see Meers et al. 2008, 2010). Extensive vegetation surveys were undertaken in
    each of these land-use types which were the subject of earlier work (Meers et
    al. 2008, 2010). In total, 179 species were recorded across all land-use types.

  unit_in: m
  trait_name: plant_height
  entity_type: species
  value_type: maximum
  basis_of_value: measurement
  replicates: .na
  methods: Potential plant height was determined from flora descriptions (Cochrane
    et al. 1968; Grime et al. 1988; Scarlett et al. 1992; Society for Growing Australian
    Plants 1993; Costermans 1994; Walsh and Entwistle 1994; McCann 1996; Walsh and
    Entwistle 1996; Codd et al. 1998; Walsh and Entwistle 1999; McCann 2000; Calder
    et al. 2002). For grasses, geophytes and rosette forming species, records of height
    to the top of flowering stems were excluded, following Westoby (1998) and Cornelissen
    et al. (2003) (i.e. potential height is to the top of the rosette). The mean of
    the maximum plant heights provided in all descriptions was calculated and assigned
    to each species.

  unit_in: mm2
  trait_name: leaf_area
  entity_type: population
  value_type: mean
  basis_of_value: measurement
  replicates: 5
  methods: Mature leaves were collected from five healthy plants of each species during
    August and September 2005. For each species, leaf area was measured for ten leaves
    using a LI-COR leaf area meter (LI-COR Biosciences, USA). The petiole was included
    in the measurement as recommended by Westoby (1998). Leaves were oven dried for
    72 hours at 65 deg C and weighed on a AX205 model Mettler Toledo Delta Range balance
    (Mettler Toledo Ltd., Australia) with 0.01 mg precision. Mean SLA was then calculated
    for each species.

- var_in: seed_mass_mg
  unit_in: mg
  trait_name: seed_dry_mass
  entity_type: population
  value_type: mean
  basis_of_value: measurement
  replicates: 5
  methods: Throughout the present study, 'seed' refers to both true seeds and diaspores
    without easily detachable structures. Seed was collected from a minimum of five
    plants of each species, and when not available from the field, seed was obtained
    from local seed suppliers if possible. An additional column in the data.csv file
    indicates the source for seeds for those species not collected in the field. A
    comparison of seeds for species obtained from both sources revealed that seed
    source did not have a significant effect on seed size (T. Meers, unpubl. data).
- var_in: dispersal_mode
  unit_in: .na
  trait_name: dispersal_syndrome
  entity_type: species
  value_type: mode
  basis_of_value: expert_score
  replicates: .na
  methods: Dispersal mechanisms were determined from diaspore characteristics following
    Cornelissen et al. (2003) (Table 3.1). Since it was difficult to determine if
    some species were myrmecochores, this dispersal mechanism was confirmed from the
    literature (Berg 1975; Rice and Westoby 1981; Benson and McDougall 1996; French
    and Westoby 1996; Benson and McDougall 2001). Some species in the family Epacridaceae
    have a fleshy outer layer to the drupe that acts as an eliosome (Berg 1975). Rather
    than being classified as endozoochores, these species were classified as myrmecochores
    except where drupes had moist flesh that changed colour on maturity, following
    Westoby et al. (1990). There were relatively few ballistically dispersed species
    and most were also myrmecochores (Rice and Westoby 1981). Therefore, ballistochores
    were classified as either myrmecochores or barochores, following Leishman et al.
    (1995). Flynn et al. (2004) describes all barochores with a mass less than 0.1
    mg as being dispersed by wind or animals, (as well as some species with mass greater
    than 0.1 mg). Therefore a seed mass of 0.1 mg was arbitrarily used to separate
    these self-dispersed (termed 'mobile' sensu McIntyre et al. (1995)) species from
    barochores with heavier seed.

  unit_in: .na
  trait_name: life_form
  entity_type: species

  methods: Life-form classification followed Raunkiaer (1934) with classification
    of growth form within hemicryptophytes following McIntyre et al. (1995) (www.jstor.org/stable/2261148) based on rosette form (Table 3.1).
- var_in: nutrient_uptake_strategy
  unit_in: .na
  trait_name: root_structure
  entity_type: species
  value_type: mode
  basis_of_value: expert_score
  replicates: .na
  methods: Nutrient uptake strategy was determined from roots of species grown in
    soil from the Delatite Peninsula. Root segments were cleared in a 3% hydrogen
    peroxide solution for 24 hours, and stained for 24 hours in a 0.05% trypan blue
    in 2 to 1 to 1 lactic acid to  water to  glycerol solution (following Giovanetti
    and Mosse 1980). Nutrient uptake strategy was assigned based on the presence or
    absence of mycorrhizal hyphae or root nodules after examining roots under an Olympus
    stereo microscope (Olympus Corporation, Japan) (Table 3.1). Literature sources
    were used for species where nutrient uptake strategies could not be determined
    (Warcup 1980; McGee 1986; Harley and Harley 1987; Grime et al. 1988; Bellgard
    1991; Brundrett and Abbott 1991; Puppi and Tartaglini 1991; McLean and Lawrie
    1996). Several species exhibited more than one nutrient uptake strategy, such
    as nitrogen fixation and arbscular mycorrhiza. Where nutrient uptake strategy
    could not be determined, species were classified as 'none detected' and then compared
    against a list of plant families that are typically non-mycorrhizal (Newman and
    Reddell 1987). Most species for which infection was not detected belonged to these
    families, so species were assumed to be non-mycorrhizal. However some grass species
    (family Poaceae) were likely to be mycorrhizal as this family is typically infected
    by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (Newman and Reddell 1987).

  value_type: mode
  basis_of_value: expert_score
  replicates: .na
  methods: Weiher et al. (1999) recommend classifying clonal spread as the presence
    or absence of a clonal growth mechanism. Therefore, species were considered clonal
    if they had at least one of the mechanisms of clonal spread outlined in Cornelissen
    et al. (2003) (Table 3.1). A specimen of all herbaceous perennials was dug up
    in July 2004 to determine the presence of clonal growth mechanisms.

- var_in: fire_response
  unit_in: .na
  trait_name: fire_response
  entity_type: species
  value_type: mode
  basis_of_value: expert_score
  replicates: .na
  methods: Fire response was classified as either re-sprouting or killed by 100% canopy
    scorch. This was determined from the Department of Sustainability and Environment
    (Victoria) (DSE) Vital Attribute database (DSE 2001) and the Ecology of Sydney
    Flora database (Benson and McDougall 1993; 1994; 1995; 1996; 1997; 1998; 1999;
    2000; 2001; 2002; 2005). Where responses conflicted, the most frequent response
    was assigned to the species. Species killed by fire rely solely on regeneration
    by seed so were termed 'seeders' (e.g. Gill and Bradstock 1995). These seeders
    included both native species adapted recurrent fires and introduced species that
    would also killed in the passage of a fire.
