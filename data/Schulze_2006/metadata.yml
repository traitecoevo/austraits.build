  description: To test to what extent the species studied along an aridity gradient
    in West Australia (Nicolle et al. 2006, Schulze et al. 2006) were indeed genetically
    adapted to drought, we measured the d13C and leaf characteristics in a common
    garden of a total of 422 species that grow in Western Australia and South Australia,
    including 45 species common to those collected along the transect from southwestern
    to central Australia.
  basis_of_record: captive_cultivated
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: Ten to 20 leaves from the top of the canopy that had grown in
    full sunlight were collected in December 2004. Leaves from 422 species, one tree
    per species, whose native habitat is South Australia and Western Australia, were
    collected.

    description: The arboretum is a private collection of Dean Nicolle (2003), who
      established the arboretum in 1993 and is located at Currency Creek (35260S,
      138460E), 80 km south of Adelaide. The climate at the site is Mediterranean
      with a mean annual rainfall of about 400 mm predominantly in the winter (425
      mm in 2004, the year of collection), and with winter minimum temperatures of
      +2 deg C and maximum summer temperatures of +40 deg C. The soil is a sandy loam
      (3-10 m depth) over a grey clay or sandstone. The groundwater which was used
      for irrigating the trees in the year of establishment is moderately saline (2000
      mg g1) and occurs at 60 m below the surface. Tree height at sampling in 2004
      ranged between 2 and 9 m.

  methods: Ten to 20 leaves from the top of the canopy that had grown in full sunlight
    were collected in December 2004. The carbon isotope ratio (d13C) was determined
    following combustion using an isotope ratio mass spectrometer (Finnigan Delta
    + XL, Bremen, Germany) in an on-line continuous flow system (precision- 0.1 p.p.m.).

  methods: Ten to 20 leaves from the top of the canopy that had grown in full sunlight
    were collected in December 2004. The leaves were finely ground and the total leaf
    N determined using a nitrogen analyser (Vario EL II, Elementar, Hanau, Germany).

  methods: Ten to 20 leaves from the top of the canopy that had grown in full sunlight
    were collected in December 2004. The area of the leaves was measured with an area
    meter (Li-3100, LiCor Inc, Lincoln, NE, USA) and the dry weight determined after
    drying for 48 h in a forceddraught oven at 70 deg C so that the SLA could be calculated.
