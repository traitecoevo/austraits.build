  description: This paper examines the inorganic and organic nutrient reserves of
    seeds of eight species of larger-seeded Proteaceae from south-western Australia
    using chemical and histochemical techniques, light and electron microscopy and
    scanning X-ray microanalysis to characterize and locate the principal reserve
    compounds in seed tissues.
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: Three representative samples, each of 50 mature fruits, were
    collected from the following species of Proteaceae growing in natural habitat
    in Western Australia. Representative samples of at least 100 mature leaves were
    collected from near the fruits. The soils at most sites were deep, mineral-deficient
    sands, but at Chillitup the shallow, sandy topsoil contained lateritic gravel
    and overlay quartz sandstone (Beard 1979) and at Hopetoun the soil was a shallow
    bleached sand overlying quartzite (Beard 1976).

  methods: Three representative samples, each of 50 mature fruits, were collected
    from the following species of Proteaceae growing in natural habitat in Western
    Australia. Fruits of all species were separated into seeds and outer woody parts.
    Seed coats were removed from G. annulifera, Hakea spp. and Xylomelum and the embryos
    used for analyses; dewinged seeds were used for the other species. These fruit
    parts were oven-dried, weighed and milled to a fine powder prior to analysis.
    Total N was determined by steam distillation of Kjeldahl digests, and amino acids
    were measured with a Beckman i20 Z amino acid anaiyser as described by Atkins
    et al. (1975).

  methods: Three representative samples, each of 50 mature fruits, were collected
    from the following species of Proteaceae growing in natural habitat in Western
    Australia. Method 1 was used to determine protein content. Percentage total N
    in dry matter was determined and multiplied by the conventional factor of 6.25
    to derive protein content.

  methods: Three representative samples, each of 50 mature fruits, were collected
    from the following species of Proteaceae growing in natural habitat in Western
    Australia. Method 2 was used to determine protein content. Amino acid analyses
    were made of 6 N HC1 hydrolysates of defatted (Soxhlet extracted) seed meal, following
    rigorous elution of the meal with 80% ethanol to remove free amino compounds.
    Protein values were then expressed as weight of amino acid recovered from the
    hydrolysate per unit weight of initial seed matter, i.e. after correcting for
    pre-hydrolysis weight losses from the seed meal during the Soxhlet and ethanolic
    extractions. This is considered the most reliable method.

  methods: Three representative samples, each of 50 mature fruits, were collected
    from the following species of Proteaceae growing in natural habitat in Western
    Australia. Method 3 was used to determine protein content. Defatted, ethanol-extracted
    seed meal was extracted  horoughly with 1 N NaOH to solubilize protein. Determinations
    of total N were made on these NaOH extracts. Total protein was then estimated
    as N x 6.25, and expressed in terms of weight of initial seed dry matter, i.e.
    corrected as in method 2.
