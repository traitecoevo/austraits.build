  description: This study measured the decomposition rate and flammability (ignitibility,
    sustainability and combustibility) of bark from 10 common forest tree species,
    and quantified correlations with potentially important traits to understand the
    interspecific differences in bark decomposability and flammability, and what chemical
    or physical traits drive variation in these properties.
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: Ten tree species with characteristic bark features were selected
    in the dry sclerophyll forests of Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park (33deg37'25'S,
    151deg14'39''E) and Blackwall Mountain Reserve (33deg30'26'S, 151deg20'0''E),
    north of Sydney (New South Wales, Australia). The soils at these sites are predominantly
    sandy (derived from Hawkesbury Sandstone) and very low in P (30-80 mg kg-1; Leishman
    and Thomson 2005). Mean annual temperature was 17 deg C and mean annual rainfall
    1332mm for these sites over the past 50 years or more (http://www.bom.gov. au/climate/data/,
    accessed on 8 October 2015). Tree species, all belonging to the Myrtaceae family,
    were selected based on their bark characteristics, abundance and their contribution
    of bark to the litter layer (a full list of species is provided in Table 1). We
    deliberately chose species with visually different bark types, including 'smooth
    barks' and 'stringybarks' (Fig. 1). Although the stringybark species (Eucalyptus
    eugenioides Sieber ex Spreng. and Syncarpia glomulifera Sm. Nied.) do not shed
    their bark like the other species, they were included for comparison and because
    of their importance in fire spread (see further discussion below). ^p Material
    collection and trait measurements ^p Bark ^p  Bark from nine individual trees
    per species was collected in December 2012 and stored in paper bags under ambient
    laboratory conditions (21deg C). Depending on the species, the bark came off in
    different sizes and shapes (flakes, slabs and ribbons). For comparison we roughly
    standardised the bark samples by splitting them into pieces of ~13 cm2 (one sided
    surface area). This size was practical to work with, both for the decomposition
    experiments (limited by the size of the litterbags) and for the experimental burns
    (limited by the size of the muffle furnace). ^p Leaves ^p Freshly senesced leaves
    of the same species were collected from the forest floor after windy days; these
    were easily distinguished from older (partially decomposed) senesced leaves by
    their yellow colour. Unlike the samples of bark, which were true replicates of
    nine individual trees, the leaf samples were taken from a bulk-sample from ~10-40
    individual trees per species. The samples were stored in paper bags under ambient
    laboratory conditions (21 deg C).

    at 95deg C for 45 minutes in a water bath. The extracts were analysed at a wavelength
    specific to the tannin in question. Bound tannin is measured by adding 5 ml of
    Butanol HCl to the extraction residue and heating as above. Please note that these
    samples have been quantified using a condensed tannin stock prepared from Acacia
    aneura (mulga) which was the best fit we could find for the range of samples in
    question. As a consequence these values should be reported as relative numbers
    rather than absolutes.(Dalzell, S.A. & Kerven, G.L. (1998) A rapid method for

  methods: Leaves were burned as described by Grootemaat et al. (2015). Samples were
    horizontally inserted into an open-doored muffle furnace (Charles Moloney, Sydney,
    NSW, Australia) set at 400 deg C. The leaves were held by tongs on the petiole,
    in a parallel direction to the furnace door. A high frequency electrical spark
    gun was held ~8mm above the centre of each sample to provide a source of ignition
    (Gill and Moore 1996). Three thermocouples (type K, chromel-alumel) were attached
    to a stainless steel grill perpendicular to the opening of the furnace. When the
    average temperature value of the three thermocouples was ~400 deg C (+/- 10 deg
    C) leaf samples were inserted. ^p A similar set-up was used for the experimental
    burns of bark, with a few adjustments, the bark samples were inserted by tongs
    and then left on the grill. The remaining ash was collected in a stainless steel
    dish (99x99x18 mm) underneath the grill. However, the mass of the remaining ash
    was undetectable on a scale with three digits and therefore we considered the
    burns as complete combustions. The combustion process was filmed and subsequently
    analysed by using the digital video editor 'VideoPad' (NCH Software, Canberra,
    ACT, Australia). This allowed us to measure time-to-ignition (TTI) as a proxy
    for ignitibility, while sustainability was registered both by flame duration (FD)
    and smoulder duration (SD) (Grootemaat et al. 2015). Combustibility was expressed
    as initial sample mass (corresponding approximately with total mass burnt) divided
    by total burning time (sum of FD and SD).

  methods: Leaves were burned as described by Grootemaat et al. (2015). Samples were
    horizontally inserted into an open-doored muffle furnace (Charles Moloney, Sydney,
    NSW, Australia) set at 400 deg C. The leaves were held by tongs on the petiole,
    in a parallel direction to the furnace door. A high frequency electrical spark
    gun was held ~8mm above the centre of each sample to provide a source of ignition
    (Gill and Moore 1996). Three thermocouples (type K, chromel-alumel) were attached
    to a stainless steel grill perpendicular to the opening of the furnace. When the
    average temperature value of the three thermocouples was ~400 deg C (+/- 10 deg
    C) leaf samples were inserted. ^p A similar set-up was used for the experimental
    burns of bark, with a few adjustments, the bark samples were inserted by tongs
    and then left on the grill. The remaining ash was collected in a stainless steel
    dish (99x99x18 mm) underneath the grill. However, the mass of the remaining ash
    was undetectable on a scale with three digits and therefore we considered the
    burns as complete combustions. The combustion process was filmed and subsequently
    analysed by using the digital video editor 'VideoPad' (NCH Software, Canberra,
    ACT, Australia). This allowed us to measure time-to-ignition (TTI) as a proxy
    for ignitibility, while sustainability was registered both by flame duration (FD)
    and smoulder duration (SD) (Grootemaat et al. 2015). Combustibility was expressed
    as initial sample mass (corresponding approximately with total mass burnt) divided
    by total burning time (sum of FD and SD).

    This trait was recalculated for AusTraits using the standard formulation, the
    one-sided surface area of a fresh leaf divided by its ovendry mass (Prez-Harguindeguy
    et al. 2013). However, for the purpose of this study, we did not oven-dry the
    samples because we were particularly interested in the flammability across the
    three material types in the actual condition they were in (i.e. fresh, dried and
    senesced). We therefore named this variable, based on the actual weight, 'SLA*'.
    Data for 'SLA*' are also present in the data file but not incorporated into AusTraits.

    (20x15 cm; 1.5-2mm mesh) were filled with bark particles of ~13 cm2 each, or 1.0
    g of intact senesced leaves, and placed in a common garden at Macquarie University
    Fauna Park, North Ryde (33deg46'9''S, 151deg6'46''E) in January 2013. This site
    consists mainly of S. glomulifera forest - a characteristic vegetation type of
    this region (Martyn 2010). Long-term climate data indicate a mean annual rainfall
    of 1397mm (Turramurra weather station) and mean annual temperature of 17.3 degC
    (Riverview Observatory; Australian Bureau of Meteorology), i.e. similar to the
    climate of the collection sites. An overview of the seasonal pattern of rainfall
    and temperature during our study period is shown in Fig. S1, available as Supplementary
    Material to this paper. Litterbags were distributed at random on the cleared forest
    floor and staked down with 10 cm long nails. Large trees surrounding our plots
    (semi-)shaded the litterbags for most of the time. We deliberately left the samples
    uncovered, so natural processes like revegetation and litterfall could continue
    as per normal. We started the decomposition experiment with 270 bark litterbags
    (10 species x nine replicates x three retrieval times) and 180 leaf litter bags
    (10 species x six replicates x three retrieval times). After 3 months one replicate
    of each species (both for bark and leaf samples) was harvested to obtain a preliminary
    estimate of the decomposition rate. Based on the latter, we decided to harvest
    the first batch of leaves after 3.5 months. Since bark decomposition was slower,
    we left the 330 Australian Journal of Botany S. Grootemaat et al. bark for a later
    harvest. The two other harvest moments were after 12 and 24 months (bark and leaves).
    After harvesting, samples were dried at 60 degC for >=10 days until equilibrium
    mass. After brushing off any dirt, the remaining sample mass was weighed.

    litterbags (20x15 cm; 1.5-2mm mesh) were filled with bark particles of ~13 cm2
    each, or 1.0 g of intact senesced leaves, and placed in a common garden at Macquarie
    University Fauna Park, North Ryde (33deg46'9''S, 151deg6'46''E) in January 2013.
    This site consists mainly of S. glomulifera forest - a characteristic vegetation
    type of this region (Martyn 2010). Long-term climate data indicate a mean annual
    rainfall of 1397mm (Turramurra weather station) and mean annual temperature of
    17.3 degC (Riverview Observatory; Australian Bureau of Meteorology), i.e. similar
    to the climate of the collection sites. An overview of the seasonal pattern of
    rainfall and temperature during our study period is shown in Fig. S1, available
    as Supplementary Material to this paper. Litterbags were distributed at random
    on the cleared forest floor and staked down with 10 cm long nails. Large trees
    surrounding our plots (semi-)shaded the litterbags for most of the time. We deliberately
    left the samples uncovered, so natural processes like revegetation and litterfall
    could continue as per normal. We started the decomposition experiment with 270
    bark litterbags (10 species x nine replicates x three retrieval times) and 180
    leaf litter bags (10 species x six replicates x three retrieval times). After
    3 months one replicate of each species (both for bark and leaf samples) was harvested
    to obtain a preliminary estimate of the decomposition rate. Based on the latter,
    we decided to harvest the first batch of leaves after 3.5 months. Since bark decomposition
    was slower, we left the 330 Australian Journal of Botany S. Grootemaat et al.
    bark for a later harvest. The two other harvest moments were after 12 and 24 months
    (bark and leaves). After harvesting, samples were dried at 60 degC for >=10 days
    until equilibrium mass. After brushing off any dirt, the remaining sample mass
    was weighed.
