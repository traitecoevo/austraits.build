  description: An analysis of wood tissue fractions of 16 Australian angiosperm species
    sampled from two nearby areas with similar climate but very different soil nutrient
    profiles and investigation of structure-function links with soil and tissue nutrient
    concentrations and other plant traits.
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: Plant material for nutrient analysis, wood anatomy and trait
    measurements was collected at the end of austral summer in April 2017 and for
    twig and leaf samples again in early spring in October 2017. For measuring tissue
    fractions in xylem, one wood core of the main trunk and one twig sample per tree
    was taken. The wood cores of length 5-6 cm were extracted using an increment borer
    with an inner diameter of 5.15 mm (Haglof, Langsele, Sweden). The samples were
    transported in marked straws to ensure the determination of inner and outer segments.
    In the lab the cores were immediately divided into five segments of 1 cm length
    for sapwood nutrient analysis, sapwood wood anatomy, wood density, inner wood
    anatomy, and inner wood nutrient analysis (from the outer to the inner wood, respectively).
    Fresh samples for wood anatomy were stored in 70% ethanol until further processing
    while nutrient samples were oven dried at 60 deg C for 48 h. Ethanol storage has
    proven to be a better storage method based on preliminary work, as cutting previously
    dried samples led to lower quality sections in some species. For wood density
    samples the fresh volume was determined using the water-displacement method according
    to Archimedes' principle with subsequent oven drying at 105 deg C for 48 h. For
    the twig samples one sun-exposed branch per tree optimally in mid-canopy position
    was chosen and cut using loppers mounted on an elongated pole. From this branch
    a healthy twig with diameter 5-7 mm was selected and a 3-4 cm segment removed
    for wood anatomy and for nutrient analysis.

  methods: 'Measurement on branch samples; Anatomical trait measures and cell type
    fractions were obtained from transverse sections of twig and stem wood (Figure
    1). The 10-25 um thick sections were cut using a sledge microtome (Reichert, Vienna,
    Austria) and disposable blades (model A35, Feather Safety Razor Co. Ltd, Japan).
    Additionally, tangential sections were made for species where the differentiation
    of axial parenchyma, tracheids, and fibers appeared problematic. Subsequently
    the sections were stained as follows: staining in 1% safranin (Sigma-Aldrich,
    Castle Hill, Australia) in 50% ethanol solution for 2 min, washing with distilled
    water, staining in 1% Astra Blue (Australian Biostain Pty Ltd, Traralgon, Australia)
    for 30 min, washing with distilled water, and gradually dehydrating over 50% ethanol,
    75% ethanol to 99% ethanol, each step taking 2 min. P. undulatum and S. australis
    sections were stained in Astra Blue only for 15 min as the coloring was sufficiently
    saturated after this time. The sections were then mounted in Euparal (BioQuip
    Products, Rancho Dominguez, USA) and dried at 60 deg C over 72 h. To determine
    cell types in detail, high resolution photographs were taken at 200x magnification
    using a Nikon digital camera (model DXM 1200F, Nikon Corporation, Japan) mounted
    on a light microscope (Olympus BX 50F, Olympus Co. Ltd., Japan). To analyze cell
    type fractions and other anatomical traits on larger segments, we took images
    using a stereo-microscope with an automatic stage equipped with a digital camera
    (SteREOV20, Carl Zeiss MicroImaging GmbH, Goettingen, Germany) at 125x magnification.
    Per sample, from 10 up to 40 single images were stitched together to obtain the
    whole cross-sectional area. Images were processed with Adobe Photoshop CS6 (version
    13.0, Adobe Systems Incorporated, USA) and ImageJ (version 1.3e). From each stem
    section a rectangular shaped area (6-30 mm2) was analyzed using as much as possible
    of the wood core lengths. For twig samples either half or one quarter of each
    cross section, depending on the quality of the section, was analyzed yielding
    1-18 mm2 of sapwood area. To determine cell tissue fractions we used a grid-based
    counting method as described by Zieminska et al. (2015). Each sample image was
    overlaid with a regular grid of lines spaced 120-140 um apart for stem and 40-80
    um apart for twig sections in ImageJ. A minimum 300 intersections for each sample
    was ensured. Each grid intersection point overlaying the image region was then
    classified using the ''Cell counter'' plugin (https://imagej.net/Cell_Counter)
    depending on which tissue type it was located on, marked and added by tissue type.
    Anatomical definitions followed ''IAWA list of microscopic features for hardwood
    identification'' (IAWA Committee 1989). Cell types were grouped in five categories
    based on staining, cell wall characteristics and cellular content: 1) conduits:
    vessel and other conduit lumen, 2) axial parenchyma, 3) ray parenchyma, 4) fiber:
    fiber lumen together with fiber and conduit wall 5) other: all other cell types
    including mucilage or oil cells and cell type that could not be determined with
    certainty. To distinguish between thin-walled fibers and thick-walled axial parenchyma,
    section fragments were inspected with higher magnification and tangential sections
    were consulted to assess whether the axial cells have a spindle-shaped morphology
    typical for fibers or are rectangular and arranged in strands as typical for axial
    parenchyma. Septate fibers are known to occur in three of our study species, namely
    Pittosporum undulatum, Synoum glandulosum, and Sloanea australis. These cells
    play a role in starch storage and can remain nucleated at maturity in the outer
    xylem (Rajput and Rao, 1999; Carlquist, 2015; Carlquist, 2018). Here, we included
    septate fibers under category (4), as their abundance is difficult to quantify
    accurately from transverse sections and the determination of their metabolic activity
    requires molecular techniques, radioactive stains or high-resolution microcopy.
    Other anatomical traits measured were determined using the particle-analysis function
    from ImageJ for estimating vessel density (VD, n mm-1), the idealized vessels

    Austria) and disposable blades (model A35, Feather Safety Razor Co. Ltd, Japan).
    Additionally, tangential sections were made for species where the differentiation
    of axial parenchyma, tracheids, and fibers appeared problematic. Subsequently
    the sections were stained as follows: staining in 1% safranin (Sigma-Aldrich,
    Castle Hill, Australia) in 50% ethanol solution for 2 min, washing with distilled
    water, staining in 1% Astra Blue (Australian Biostain Pty Ltd, Traralgon, Australia)
    for 30 min, washing with distilled water, and gradually dehydrating over 50% ethanol,
    75% ethanol to 99% ethanol, each step taking 2 min. P. undulatum and S. australis
    sections were stained in Astra Blue only for 15 min as the coloring was sufficiently
    saturated after this time. The sections were then mounted in Euparal (BioQuip
    Products, Rancho Dominguez, USA) and dried at 60 deg C over 72 h. To determine
    cell types in detail, high resolution photographs were taken at 200x magnification
    using a Nikon digital camera (model DXM 1200F, Nikon Corporation, Japan) mounted
    on a light microscope (Olympus BX 50F, Olympus Co. Ltd., Japan). To analyze cell
    type fractions and other anatomical traits on larger segments, we took images
    using a stereo-microscope with an automatic stage equipped with a digital camera
    (SteREOV20, Carl Zeiss MicroImaging GmbH, Goettingen, Germany) at 125x magnification.
    Per sample, from 10 up to 40 single images were stitched together to obtain the
    whole cross-sectional area. Images were processed with Adobe Photoshop CS6 (version
    13.0, Adobe Systems Incorporated, USA) and ImageJ (version 1.3e). From each stem
    section a rectangular shaped area (6-30 mm2) was analyzed using as much as possible
    of the wood core lengths. For twig samples either half or one quarter of each
    cross section, depending on the quality of the section, was analyzed yielding
    1-18 mm2 of sapwood area. To determine cell tissue fractions we used a grid-based
    counting method as described by Zieminska et al. (2015). Each sample image was
    overlaid with a regular grid of lines spaced 120-140 um apart for stem and 40-80
    um apart for twig sections in ImageJ. A minimum 300 intersections for each sample
    was ensured. Each grid intersection point overlaying the image region was then
    classified using the ''Cell counter'' plugin (https://imagej.net/Cell_Counter)
    depending on which tissue type it was located on, marked and added by tissue type.
    Anatomical definitions followed ''IAWA list of microscopic features for hardwood
    identification'' (IAWA Committee 1989). Cell types were grouped in five categories
    based on staining, cell wall characteristics and cellular content: 1) conduits:
    vessel and other conduit lumen, 2) axial parenchyma, 3) ray parenchyma, 4) fiber:
    fiber lumen together with fiber and conduit wall 5) other: all other cell types
    including mucilage or oil cells and cell type that could not be determined with
    certainty. To distinguish between thin-walled fibers and thick-walled axial parenchyma,
    section fragments were inspected with higher magnification and tangential sections
    were consulted to assess whether the axial cells have a spindle-shaped morphology
    typical for fibers or are rectangular and arranged in strands as typical for axial
    parenchyma. Septate fibers are known to occur in three of our study species, namely
    Pittosporum undulatum, Synoum glandulosum, and Sloanea australis. These cells
    play a role in starch storage and can remain nucleated at maturity in the outer

    50% ethanol solution for 2 min, washing with distilled water, staining in 1% Astra
    Blue (Australian Biostain Pty Ltd, Traralgon, Australia) for 30 min, washing with
    distilled water, and gradually dehydrating over 50% ethanol, 75% ethanol to 99%
    ethanol, each step taking 2 min. P. undulatum and S. australis sections were stained
    in Astra Blue only for 15 min as the coloring was sufficiently saturated after
    this time. The sections were then mounted in Euparal (BioQuip Products, Rancho
    Dominguez, USA) and dried at 60 deg C over 72 h. To determine cell types in detail,
    high resolution photographs were taken at 200x magnification using a Nikon digital
    camera (model DXM 1200F, Nikon Corporation, Japan) mounted on a light microscope
    (Olympus BX 50F, Olympus Co. Ltd., Japan). To analyze cell type fractions and
    other anatomical traits on larger segments, we took images using a stereo-microscope
    with an automatic stage equipped with a digital camera (SteREOV20, Carl Zeiss
    MicroImaging GmbH, Goettingen, Germany) at 125x magnification. Per sample, from
    10 up to 40 single images were stitched together to obtain the whole cross-sectional
    area. Images were processed with Adobe Photoshop CS6 (version 13.0, Adobe Systems
    Incorporated, USA) and ImageJ (version 1.3e). From each stem section a rectangular
    shaped area (6-30 mm2) was analyzed using as much as possible of the wood core
    lengths. For twig samples either half or one quarter of each cross section, depending
    on the quality of the section, was analyzed yielding 1-18 mm2 of sapwood area.
    To determine cell tissue fractions we used a grid-based counting method as described
    by Zieminska et al. (2015). Each sample image was overlaid with a regular grid
    of lines spaced 120-140 um apart for stem and 40-80 um apart for twig sections
    in ImageJ. A minimum 300 intersections for each sample was ensured. Each grid
    intersection point overlaying the image region was then classified using the ''Cell
    counter'' plugin (https://imagej.net/Cell_Counter) depending on which tissue type
    it was located on, marked and added by tissue type. Anatomical definitions followed
    ''IAWA list of microscopic features for hardwood identification'' (IAWA Committee
    1989). Cell types were grouped in five categories based on staining, cell wall
    characteristics and cellular content: 1) conduits: vessel and other conduit lumen,
    2) axial parenchyma, 3) ray parenchyma, 4) fiber: fiber lumen together with fiber
    and conduit wall 5) other: all other cell types including mucilage or oil cells
    and cell type that could not be determined with certainty. To distinguish between
    thin-walled fibers and thick-walled axial parenchyma, section fragments were inspected
    with higher magnification and tangential sections were consulted to assess whether
    the axial cells have a spindle-shaped morphology typical for fibers or are rectangular
    and arranged in strands as typical for axial parenchyma. Septate fibers are known
    to occur in three of our study species, namely Pittosporum undulatum, Synoum glandulosum,
    and Sloanea australis. These cells play a role in starch storage and can remain
    nucleated at maturity in the outer xylem (Rajput and Rao, 1999; Carlquist, 2015;
    Carlquist, 2018). Here, we included septate fibers under category (4), as their
    abundance is difficult to quantify accurately from transverse sections and the
    determination of their metabolic activity requires molecular techniques, radioactive
    stains or high-resolution microcopy. Other anatomical traits measured were determined
    using the particle-analysis function from ImageJ for estimating vessel density
    (VD, n mm-1), the idealized vessels diameter (d)'

  methods: Stem sample; For measuring tissue fractions in xylem, one wood core of
    the main trunk and one twig sample per tree was taken. The wood cores of length
    5-6 cm were extracted using an increment borer with an inner diameter of 5.15
    mm (Haglof, Langsele, Sweden). The samples were transported in marked straws to
    ensure the determination of inner and outer segments. In the lab the cores were
    immediately divided into five segments of 1 cm length for sapwood nutrient analysis,
    sapwood wood anatomy, wood density, inner wood anatomy, and inner wood nutrient
    analysis (from the outer to the inner wood, respectively). Fresh samples for wood
    anatomy were stored in 70% ethanol until further processing while nutrient samples
    were oven dried at 60 deg C for 48 h. Ethanol storage has proven to be a better
    storage method based on preliminary work, as cutting previously dried samples
    led to lower quality sections in some species. All plant samples were oven-dried
    at 60 deg C for 48 h and then ground and analyzed for C+N contents with a CN auto-analyzer
    (Vario EL III, Hanau, Germany) and for P and other nutrients after HNO3 digestion

    for wood anatomy and for nutrient analysis. From this branch, 5-30 healthy and
    intact mature leaves (the youngest fully expanded leaves without any sign of damage)
    were taken and dust removed using wet tissue. Senescent leaves (usually visually
    determinable by an altered color and easy to detach) were collected from the same
    branch or at least the same tree by shaking the tree or touching the leaf by hand.
    In the lab, bark from nutrient-sample twigs was carefully removed and bagged separately.
    Small pieces of stem bark were removed using a knife or small chisel. All plant
    samples were oven-dried at 60 deg C for 48 h and then ground and analyzed for
    C+N contents with a CN auto-analyzer (Vario EL III, Hanau, Germany) and for P
    and other nutrients after HNO3 digestion by inductively coupled plasma optical
    emission spectrometry analysis (Perkin Elmer Optima 5300 DV) at the University

  methods: Leaf demography was monitored from May'17-May'18 to obtain leaf birth and
    shedding. Leaf lifespan was then calculated per species as the mean of these two
    variables pooled over all branches. For each species at least ten well-developed
    twigs from 5-9 individual trees were randomly selected in a sun exposed but easy
    to reach position optimally at the mid-crown of the marked individuals. Occasionally
    large individuals were bent over and held for the duration of the counting. For
    each of these twigs a detailed map drawing was created carefully marking and counting
    green, senescent and dry leaves at each sampling date - May'17, July'17 and May'18
    (Milla et al., 2004). Diameter growth at the twig base and at three additional
    marked locations along the twig was recorded also.

questions:
  contributor: In your list of sites there was no LowP_7, although there were samples
    for it. And there was a site called LowP_2, but not samples for it. I'm just confirming
    this was correct? (Overall, I'm using your 12 site names/coordinates as the main
    site locations, but then having the individual tree coordinates in the data.csv
    file.)
  question2: Is it reasonable to align your Huber value calculations those made in
    all other studies, where the total sapwood diameter was used? Because your values
    are 10-50x higher than any others.
