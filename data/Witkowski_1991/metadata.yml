  description: Study of seed bank dynamics of three co-occurring, non-sprouting Banksia
    species in the southern sandplains of Western Australia, to compare to seed bank
    dynamics of non-sprouting Banksia species in the northern sandplains.
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: Study Sites ^p The study site was located on a dune system of
    deep infertile siliceous sands, 26 km E. of the south coastal town of Hopetoun,
    W.A. and 1-2km inland from the coast (33" 57'S.,120° 23'E., 20m a.s.1.). The site
    was burnt about 10 years ago by a patchy (probably spring) burn which resulted
    in intermingled remnants of the parent population which were 21 years old at the
    time of the study (stem increment counts, Lamont 1985). A second site, 4 km E.
    of the first, consisted of a stand of only 21-year-old plants. The vegetation
    was Banksia scrub-heath about 3 m in height, consisting of evergreen sclerophyllous
    trees, shrubs and herbs. The length of the growing season is 7-8 months compared
    with 4-5 months for the northern sandplains (Bartlett 1975). Annual rainfall is
    528 mm (range 376-687 mm), and mean maximum and minimum temperatures are 25.7OC
    and 7.7OC respectively. Soils are at least 10m deep, infertile, mildly acidic
    (pH 5.9 5 0.2), siliceous sands.

  methods: Fifteen young (10 years) and five old (21 years) individuals of each species
    were chosen at random in autumn 1988 to study their seed bank dynamics. The numbers
    of fertile (with follicles) and infertile cones produced each year (determined
    by stem increments, Lamont 1985) were counted. Ten cones (or the total if < 10)
    of each age were sampled from each plant. Age to first flowering and age to first
    fertile cone were determined.

  methods: Fifteen young (10 years) and five old (21 years) individuals of each species
    were chosen at random in autumn 1988 to study their seed bank dynamics. The numbers
    of fertile (with follicles) and infertile cones produced each year (determined
    by stem increments, Lamont 1985) were counted. Ten cones (or the total if < 10)
    of each age were sampled from each plant. Age to first flowering and age to first
    fertile cone were determined. The number of florets in 20 of the most recent flower
    heads from the younger plants was counted and relative fruit set and seed set
    estimated. Masses of 20 seeds from the most recent crop of the 10-year-old plants
    were determined. Numbers of opened and closed follicles per cone were counted.
    ^p Cones were burnt to rupture the follicles, immersed in water for 1 min and
    left to dry for a week to aid seed removal. Each closed follicle contained two
    seeds. Seeds were classified as aborted, eaten/ decayed, firm or dispersed. The
    viability of firm seeds was determined by germinating two batches of 30 firm seeds
    of each age. Some of the older ages were pooled owing to low numbers of seeds
    available. Seeds were surface sterilised using sodium hypochlorite (5%) for 5min,
    rinsed and placed in filter paper over vermiculite in petri dishes (150 mm diam.).
    These were moistened with a fungicid solution (Benlate @, 1 gL-I), and kept in
    a growth cabinet at 15OC. Germination was observed for 50 days and percentage
    germination calculated. (Notes, this value is the % of viable seeds in Table 2,
    which based on the methods described is assumed to be germination, as germination
    isn't recorded elsewhere and `viable + non-viable` do not sum to 1.)
