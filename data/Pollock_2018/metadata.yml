  description: Here, we address the generality of trait-environment relations by asking
    whether these relationships hold for different sampling schemes, environmental
    variables and species sets, in a satudy focused on drought and fire-resistant
    "mallee" eucalypts of a semi-arid region of southeast Australia.
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: The study area covers ca. 56,680 km2 in southeast Australia covering
    1.3 deg of latitude. Large tracts of native vegetation are characterized by stands
    of mallee vegetation (i.e., vegetation dominated by Eucalyptus spp. with a multi-stemmed
    growth form; White, 2006; Haslem et al., 2010). Native vegetation on floodplain
    areas is dominated by taller, single-stemmed eucalypts including E. largiflorens
    and E. camaldulensis (White, 2006). Native vegetation has been widely cleared
    for agriculture outside protected areas, with remnant vegetation largely restricted
    to less fertile soils and sand dunes (White, 2006). The region is low elevation
    (less than or equal to 100 m a.s.l.) and dominated by undulating dunes and swales
    bisected by the Murray-Darling river basin. The climate is semi-arid. Annual rainfall
    ranges from 230 mm in the north to 315 mm in the south. Summers are hot with maximum
    temperatures often exceeding 35 deg C and frosts are frequent in the winter. Higher
    temperatures and lower rainfall occur in the north and lower temperatures and
    higher rainfall in the south. Fire is a major driver of mallee vegetation structure,
    function and change (Bradstock et al., 2002), and wildfires exceeding 100,000
    ha typically occur in the region every 10-20 years (Avitabile et al., 2013). ^p
    Eleven Eucalyptus species occur in the study area. Eight species have a short
    (<10 m), multi-stemmed growth form (hereafter "mallee-form"). Three species have
    a tall (>10 m), single-stemmed growth form (hereafter "tree-form"). We sourced
    eucalypt occurrence records from two data sets, Victoria's Biodiversity Atlas
    (VBA; Department of Environment and Primary Industries) and The Mallee Fire and
    Biodiversity Project (MFBP; Haslem et al., 2010). These two data sets cover roughly
    the same spatial extent but represent different sampling strategies. VBA data
    are part of a larger data set of 40,000 quadrats (or sample sites) collected over
    the past 40 years across the state of Victoria and neighbouring areas for the
    purpose of vegetation classification. Here, we used the 3,630 plots with eucalypt
    data in the study region. Survey plots are typically 900 m2 in size, with size
    differences arising from local environmental variation. Plots are spread across
    the study area, but not systematically placed along particular environmental gradients.
    This serves as an extensive sampling design, covering a wide range of space and
    climate, but without intensive sampling within landscapes. The MFBP data set includes
    occurrence records of eight species of eucalypt from 598 sites in large nature
    reserves in Victoria and New South Wales (Haslem et al., 2010). We selected a
    subset of sites from the broader MFBP data that better matched the VBA data (i.e.,
    we excluded data from South Australia). MFBP survey sites were clustered into
    landscapes, each a circular area 4 km in diameter (12.56 km2), selected to represent
    variation in fire regimes and stratified to sample dune-swale sequences (Clarke
    et al., 2010). In 2007, vegetation surveys were conducted once at each site in
    a quadrat 10 x 50 m (500 m2; Haslem et al., 2010). The MFBP data are restricted
    to vegetation on sandier soils, in conservation reserves, only contain mallee
    growth form species, but have detailed plot-based soil measurements and intensively
    sampling local landscape variation. In contrast, the VBA data include vegetation
    on a wider range of soils, including those in agricultural areas, and both mallee
    and tree growth forms. These two data sets allow us to contrast trait-environment
    relationships across differing environmental ranges, for different growth forms,
    and to reveal whether an extensive plot data set results in different inferences
    than intensive stratified sampling.

  methods: Eucalypt leaves and fruits were collected in Murray Sunset NP, Wyperfeld
    NP and Little Desert NP in 2012-2013. Potential sites were located using field
    guides and recorded locations of species from both data sets, and we sampled 40
    sites spread across the region. At each sample site, we collected trait data on
    three individuals of each species present. We collected fully expanded leaves
    not damaged by insects from canopies exposed to direct sunlight. SLA is the one-sided
    leaf surface area of fresh leaves divided by the mass of leaves oven-dried at
    65 deg C for 48 h.

    Capsules were ovendried at 65 deg C until valves opened, releasing seeds. Most
    seeds were weighed 10 at a time, except for very large seeds, which were measured
    in groups of five.
