  description: Here, we address the generality of trait–environment relations by asking whether these relationships hold for different sampling schemes, environmental variables and species sets, in a satudy focused on drought and fire-resistant "mallee" eucalypts of a semi-arid region of southeast Australia.
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: The study area covers ca. 56,680 km2 in southeast Australia covering 1.3 deg of latitude. Large tracts of native vegetation are characterized by stands of mallee vegetation (i.e., vegetation dominated by Eucalyptus spp. with a multi-stemmed growth form; White, 2006; Haslem et al., 2010). Native vegetation on floodplain areas is dominated by taller, single-stemmed eucalypts including E. largiflorens and E. camaldulensis (White, 2006). Native vegetation has been widely cleared for agriculture outside protected areas, with remnant vegetation largely restricted to less fertile soils and sand dunes (White, 2006). The region is low elevation (less than or equal to 100 m a.s.l.) and dominated by undulating dunes and swales bisected by the Murray-Darling river basin. The climate is semi-arid. Annual rainfall ranges from 230 mm in the north to 315 mm in the south. Summers are hot with maximum temperatures often exceeding 35°C and frosts are frequent in the winter. Higher temperatures and lower rainfall occur in the north and lower temperatures and higher rainfall in the south. Fire is a major driver of mallee vegetation structure, function and change (Bradstock et al., 2002), and wildfires exceeding 100,000 ha typically occur in the region every 10-20 years (Avitabile et al., 2013). ^p Eleven Eucalyptus species occur in the study area. Eight species have a short (<10 m), multi-stemmed growth form (hereafter "mallee-form"). Three species have a tall (>10 m), single-stemmed growth form (hereafter "tree-form"). We sourced eucalypt occurrence records from two data sets, Victoria's Biodiversity Atlas (VBA; Department of Environment and Primary Industries) and The Mallee Fire and Biodiversity Project (MFBP; Haslem et al., 2010). These two data sets cover roughly the same spatial extent but represent different sampling strategies. VBA data are part of a larger data set of 40,000 quadrats (or sample sites) collected over the past 40 years across the state of Victoria and neighbouring areas for the purpose of vegetation classification. Here, we used the 3,630 plots with eucalypt data in the study region. Survey plots are typically 900 m2 in size, with size differences arising from local environmental variation. Plots are spread across the study area, but not systematically placed along particular environmental gradients. This serves as an extensive sampling design, covering a wide range of space and climate, but without intensive sampling within landscapes. The MFBP data set includes occurrence records of eight species of eucalypt from 598 sites in large nature reserves in Victoria and New South Wales (Haslem et al., 2010). We selected a subset of sites from the broader MFBP data that better matched the VBA data (i.e., we excluded data from South Australia). MFBP survey sites were clustered into landscapes, each a circular area 4 km in diameter (12.56 km2), selected to represent variation in fire regimes and stratified to sample dune–swale sequences (Clarke et al., 2010). In 2007, vegetation surveys were conducted once at each site in a quadrat 10 x 50 m (500 m2; Haslem et al., 2010). The MFBP data are restricted to vegetation on sandier soils, in conservation reserves, only contain mallee growth form species, but have detailed plot-based soil measurements and intensively sampling local landscape variation. In contrast, the VBA data include vegetation on a wider range of soils, including those in agricultural areas, and both mallee and tree growth forms. These two data sets allow us to contrast trait-environment relationships across differing environmental ranges, for different growth forms, and to reveal whether an extensive plot data set results in different inferences than intensive stratified sampling.

  methods: Eucalypt leaves and fruits were collected in Murray Sunset NP, Wyperfeld NP and Little Desert NP in 2012–2013. Potential sites were located using field guides and recorded locations of species from both data sets, and we sampled 40 sites spread across the region. At each sample site, we collected trait data on three individuals of each species present. We collected fully expanded leaves not damaged by insects from canopies exposed to direct sunlight. SLA is the one-sided leaf surface area of fresh leaves divided by the mass of leaves oven-dried at 65 deg C for 48 h.

At each sample site, we collected trait data on three individuals of each species present. Four species did not fruit during field surveys; for these species we used University of Melbourne herbarium specimens instead (five individual fruit samples for each species). Seeds were measured from at least three capsules collected from each of five diff erent individuals. Capsules were ovendried at 65 deg C until valves opened, releasing seeds. Most seeds were weighed 10 at a time, except for very large seeds, which were measured in groups of five.

questions:
  contributor: Do you have coordinates for each of the study localities? Alternatively, can I use the generic coordinates for the national parks from https://placenames.fsdf.org.au/? I’m not quite sure how the site names in Euctraits::mallee align with the national parks, so if you don't have more precise coordinates, a quick solution would be if you went through the list of sites in the site_data_Pollock_2018 spreadsheet and annotated each one with the name of a park.
  question_2: In the manuscript it seems like you have modeled or collected data on other site characteristics (i.e. % sand, dune landform, etc.) Do you have actual values for these variables that would be entered as site data?
  question_3: Please confirm that I've attributed this dataset to the correct manuscript. It should be the manuscript for which the field data were first collected. If different variables from a single field campaign where published as parts of different manuscripts it is appropriate to list multiple references.
