  description: We report a case of widespread mortality of resprouters following a
    fire that burnt 98% of an 80-km2 island in Bass Strait, Australia.
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: Field observations of resprouting responses of woody plants were
    made in the summer of 2014–15, 10–11 months after the fire (Fig. 1). We recorded
    the variation in fire severity and the percentage of woody plants that resprouted
    using 197 variableradius plots designed to include 10 woody individuals .3 cm
    in basal diameter. The plots were located approximately every 50 m along field
    traverses across the island, with the number stratified according to the area
    of the five main vegetation types (heathland, grassland, Allocasuarina forest,
    shrubland and coastal vegetation) and a minimum of 20 plots in each vegetation
    type (Fig. 1). Excluding the grassland plots (because they contained few woody
    plants), there were 19 completely unburnt plots, 8 partially burnt plots and 148
    completely burnt plots.
