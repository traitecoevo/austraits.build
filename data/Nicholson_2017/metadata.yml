  description: We report a case of widespread mortality of resprouters following a
    fire that burnt 98% of an 80-km2 island in Bass Strait, Australia.
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: Field observations of resprouting responses of woody plants were
    made in the summer of 2014-15, 10-11 months after the fire (Fig. 1). We recorded
    the variation in fire severity and the percentage of woody plants that resprouted
    using 197 variableradius plots designed to include 10 woody individuals .3 cm
    in basal diameter. The plots were located approximately every 50 m along field
    traverses across the island, with the number stratified according to the area
    of the five main vegetation types (heathland, grassland, Allocasuarina forest,
    shrubland and coastal vegetation) and a minimum of 20 plots in each vegetation
    type (Fig. 1). Excluding the grassland plots (because they contained few woody
    plants), there were 19 completely unburnt plots, 8 partially burnt plots and 148
    completely burnt plots.

      branches (3 to 5 cm diameter)

    and categorised as (i) burnt or unburnt, and (ii) ''''alive'''', MAP''''top-killed
    but resprouting'''' or ''''top-killed and completely dead''''. The extent of damage
    to the crown, branches and stem of each woody individual was classified as: 1,
    trees retained their foliage; 2, foliage was removed but fine twigs persisted
    (0.5-cm diameter); 3, trees were burnt down to thin branches (0.5-3-cm diameter);
    4, trees were burnt down to thick branches (3-5-cm diameter); and 5, only stumps
    were left (all branches were removed) (Fig. 1). The median score of these measurements
    was used to characterise the fire severity of each plot. Seedling regeneration
    was not analysed because identifying the very small seedlings present was difficult,
    as sometimes was determining the species present before the fire. In AusTraits,
    a species is determined to be a resprouter if at least one burnt stem resprouted.
    Species where no burnt stems resprouted are designated as fire-killed.'
