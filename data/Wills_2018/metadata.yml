  description: In this study, we investigate if simple leaf traits are predictors
    of the more complex ecological process of plant growth in regenerating selectively
    logged natural forest within the Wet Tropics (WTs) bioregion of Australia.
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: The study sites are located within Danbulla National Park and
    State Forest, Atherton Tableland, North Queensland, Australia (17°170 S, 145°580
    E). Surrounding forest and plantations cover an area of more than 12,000 ha. The
    elevation ranges from 680 to 790 m above sea level and mean annual rainfall from
    1,370 to 1,650 mm. In this study, we use a total of four plots, which we refer
    to here as experiment 625 plots 4 and 5 and experiment 78 plots 1 and 2; this
    is done in order to remain consistent with historic data described in Historical
    data and site history. Experiment 78 is arranged as a paired plot, with two identical
    plots measuring 200 m long and 20 m wide. A 20-m buffer zone separates the two
    plots. Plots within Experiment 625 are geographically distinct and are 40 m long
    by 50 m wide (Fig. 1). The plots used in this study form part of a permanent plot
    network established by the Queensland Department of Forestry (referred to as the
    QFS permanent plots). These plots ere established for research into sustainable
    yield. Tree species and diameter at breast height (DBH) were measured for all
    trees greater than or equal to 10 DBH at regular periods dating back to 1948 for
    experiment 78 and 1968 for experiment 625 (Table 1). Experiment 78 was measured
    at intervals that ranged from 1 to 17 yr, and experiment 625 ranged from 5 to
    17 yr. In both cases, the latest remeasure was the longest interval (17 yr). Plots
    were located using a combination of historic maps and personal communication.
    Individual trees were found by first identifying trees that were within the plot
    using steel tags or finding old paint. For approximately 50% of the trees, tree
    numbers could be identified using the tree tag or painted number. For the remaining
    trees the number sequence, species identity and size were used to identify the
    individual tree. This study uses the historical data sets for a subset of the
    trees within each experiment (Fig. 1).

      and Flindersia bourjotiana occur, which prefer the slightly higher elevations
      found at these plots. The forest within the plots and in the surrounding landscape
      has been subject to selective logging within the last century, with very little
      'natural forest' remaining, and is therefore considered regenerating selectively

  methods: Canopy leaves were collected using smaller traditional sling shots and
    for large individual trees a Big Shot line launcher (SherrillTree, North Carolina,
    USA) was used. Five fully expanded sun leaves were collected per tree following
    the protocols by Perez-Harguindeguy et al. (2013). The leaves were then labeled
    and placed into paper bags in order to avoid mold growth. The leaf area was measured
    on the same day as sampling using a CID Bio-Science CI-203 Laser Area (MeterCamas,
    Washington, USA) in order to avoid leaf desiccation. These leaf samples were then
    oven dried at 65oC for 48 h in order to obtain a constant dry mass. The leaves
    were then weighed to calculate Specific Leaf Area (SLA, cm2/g) for each of the
    five leaves. SLA values presented here are the average from the five leaves collected
    per individual.
