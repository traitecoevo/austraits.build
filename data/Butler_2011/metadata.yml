  description: LMA, height and leaf size data for 43 species collected by Don Butler
    for a study looking comparing species branch performance in wind
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: Sampling occurred at three sites chosen to sample a rainfall
    gradient in tropical Australia (Table 1). The sites are referred to as WET, DRY
    and ARID, and all occurred on relatively nutrient-poor soils. The ratio of average
    annual precipitation and potential evapotranspiration was used to guide site selection
    (Willmott & Feddema, 1992). Average annual rainfall decreased by c. 40% each step
    from WET to DRY to ARID, but potential evapotranspiration was approx. constant.
    All sites were open canopied, with eucalypts (sensu lato) among their canopy dominants.
    We used a vehicle-mounted apparatus to measure drag on ascending 'lead' shoots
    1.2 m long, at wind speeds up to 30 m/s. We studied the most prominent woody species
    at each of three sites, arrayed along a rainfall gradient. Shoots sampled were
    healthy and vigorous and were collected immediately before testing. Stem diameters,
    shoot geometry and tissue material properties were measured and used to calculate
    bending moment, bending stress and safety factors for the main stem at the shoot
    base. Data on a range of other plant traits were collected to assess association
    between performance and safety in wind and other shoot attributes. We tested 127
    shoots from 39 species. Most species had three replicate samples.
