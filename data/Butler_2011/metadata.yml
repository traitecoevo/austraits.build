  sampling_strategy: Sampling occurred at three sites chosen to sample a rainfall gradient in tropical Australia (Table 1). The sites are referred to as WET, DRY and ARID, and all occurred on relatively nutrient‐poor soils. The ratio of average annual precipitation and potential evapotranspiration was used to guide site selection (Willmott & Feddema, 1992). Average annual rainfall decreased by c. 40% each step from WET to DRY to ARID, but potential evapotranspiration was approx. constant. All sites were open canopied, with eucalypts (sensu lato) among their canopy dominants. We used a vehicle‐mounted apparatus to measure drag on ascending ‘lead’ shoots 1.2 m long, at wind speeds up to 30 m s−1. We studied the most prominent woody species at each of three sites, arrayed along a rainfall gradient. Shoots sampled were healthy and vigorous and were collected immediately before testing. Stem diameters, shoot geometry and tissue material properties were measured and used to calculate bending moment, bending stress and safety factors for the main stem at the shoot base. Data on a range of other plant traits were collected to assess association between performance and safety in wind and other shoot attributes. We tested 127 shoots from 39 species. Most species had three replicate samples.
