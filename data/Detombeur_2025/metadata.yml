  description: A study that combined leaf trait measurements and microscopic analyses
    of 17 species from a high-Si family, Cyperaceae, to better understand if negative
    correlations between silicon (Si) and carbon (C)-based compounds in plants are
    linked to different stress resistance and/or mechanical support strategies.

  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: 2.1 Study Area ^p The study was conducted in Alison Baird Reserve
    - a 34.6 ha flora reserve located 20 km southeast of Perth, in south-western Australia
    (32.020° S, 115.981° E; Supporting Information Figure S1). The reserve is a Swan
    Coastal Plain (Tauss et al. 2019) shrub- and wetland remnant with high conservation
    value and is located in a global biodiversity hotspot. The climate is Mediterranean,
    with hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual maximum temperature
    is 25.6°C, the mean annual minimum temperature is 13.5°C, and the mean annual
    rainfall is 736 mm (data for Gosnells City from 1991 to 2020; www.bom.gov.au).
    ^p The landscape in Alison Baird Reserve is variable, with low-lying areas to
    the east and west that experience seasonal waterlogging in winter, and high-lying
    areas formed by a dune that runs through the middle of the reserve with heights
    of up to 5 m above flat areas and without waterlogging (Smith et al. 2023) (Supporting
    Information Figure S1). Overall, soils in the reserve are characteristic of climatically-buffered
    infertile landscapes (OCBILs), and are recognized as some of the most phosphorus
    (P)-impoverished soils globally. ^p 2.2 Species Selection and Sampling Procedure
    ^p A sampling campaign was conducted in July 2022 to identify a maximum number
    of Cyperaceae species naturally occurring in the reserve. In total, 17 perennial
    sedge species from nine genera were identified at different locations within the
    reserve (Supporting Information Figures S1 and S2; Supporting Information Table
    S1). Nearly all species studied are endemic to Western Australia but are typically
    found in a wide range of habitats (Supporting Information Table S1). While they
    all grow on sandy P-impoverished soils, some are mostly found in peaty swamps,
    and winter-wet depressions, while others are mostly on well-drained and dry soils.
    The 17 species were separated into three distinct habitat areas previously used
    to discriminate the floristic communities in Alison Baird Reserve (Tauss et al.
    2019), west, east and dune (Supporting Information Table S1; Supporting Information
    Figure S1). ^p Five individuals per species were selected - except for one less
    common species for which only three replicates were found; a total of 83 individuals
    were sampled. We consistently sampled the main green, photosynthetically active
    organ. Culms were therefore sampled for most of these species, as most of them
    had few leaves (Supporting Information Figure S2). However, when leaves were the
    main photosynthetically active organ, they were sampled instead of the culm (C.
    avenaceae, C. equitans, G. trifida, M. octandra, S. rigens). For simplicity's
    sake, leaf is used when referring to a group of species with some having leaves
    and some having culms. When referring to a single species, the correct organ name
    is used accordingly (leaf or culm). Several healthy, mature, fully developed,
    and sun-exposed leaves were sampled for each species. Soils were also sampled
    in the reserve to test the relationship between soil Si availability and plant
    Si accumulation (see Supplementary M&M and Supplementary Results).

  methods: Leaves were rehydrated with distilled water overnight, scanned at 300 dpi,

    mass content (LDMC) as the ratio between leaf dry weight and leaf fresh weight.
    Leaf mass per area (LMA) was calculated as the ratio between leaf dry weight and
    leaf surface area. For culms or round leaves, the projected surface was multiplied
    by pi and divided by two before LMA determination, to take into account the greater
    light interception allowed by such shapes.

    heated at 1000°C for 15 min. The fusion bead was then dissolved in 50 mL of 3.2%
    HCl and the concentrations of Si and P were determined by an inductively coupled
    plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES) Perkin Elmer, Optima 5300DV (Shelton,

  methods: Total phenolics and flavonoids were extracted from ca. 100 mg of ground
    sample using 1.5 mL of 75% ethanol shaken in a thermomixer for 30 min, then incubated
    in an ultrasonic bath for 20 min. The extracts were then centrifuged for 15 min.
    The extraction was repeated twice with shaking times of 45 and 90 min, respectively,
    followed by sonication. The supernatants were pooled and kept in the dark at -20°C
    until analysis. Total phenolics were determined according to Santas et al. (2008).
    In brief, the extracts were mixed with Folin-Ciocalteau reagent (Sigma-Aldrich,
    St. Louis, MO, USA) and sodium carbonate, then incubated in the dark at 20°C for
    2 h. Absorbance was measured at 765 nm using a spectrophotometer against a blank
    containing 75% ethanol. Total phenolics were determined using a calibration curve
    prepared from a series of gallic acid (GA) standards ranging from 0 to 200 mg
    L-1.

    aluminum trichloride and potassium acetate and incubating in the dark at 20°C
    for 30 min (Chang et al. 2002). Absorbance was measured at 415 nm. Total flavonoid
    equivalents were determined with quercetin standards ranging from 0 to 200 mg
    L-1.

    methanol. Extracts were incubated in an ultrasonic bath for 30 min, then centrifuged
    for 15 min. Tannin concentrations were measured with the protein-precipitable
    phenolics microplate assay, a protocol adapted from Hagerman and Butler (1978).
    Briefly, tannins were determined by adding the extracts to a standard solution
    of protein (Bovine Serum Albumin), isolating the insoluble tannin-protein complex,
    dissolving it in alkaline solution, and measuring the absorbance at 510 nm after
    adding ferric chloride.

  methods: Three new individuals of the same 17 species were sampled in the field
    2 weeks after the main sampling campaign, to measure leaf biomechanical properties
    on fresh material and conduct microscopic analyses. The force of fracture, as
    determined by a shearing test (Onoda et al. 2011), was determined using purpose-built
    equipment. The equipment is fully described and can be seen (diagrammatic representation)
    in Wright and Cannon (2001). Briefly, the equipment measures the force required
    to cut a leaf at a constant cutting angle (20°) and speed. The mean force of fracture
    for a sample was calculated as the average force (Newton, N) registered across
    the cutting trajectory (Wright and Cannon 2001). Examples of representative force-displacement
    curves can be found in Supporting Information Figure S3. Blade angle was taken
    into account by multiplying the force of fracture by tangent (20°) (Onoda et al.
    2011). The mean force of fracture divided by leaf or culm thickness gives toughness
    (N m-1). For culms and rounded leaves, the measured thickness (diameter) was multiplied
    by pi and divided by four for toughness determination.

questions:
  question1: Your values for leaf tannins are much lower than the other studies in AusTraits. Does this truly represent a different content or does it reflect different extract methods?
  question2: I haven't yet mapped in leaf flavonoids, as this isn't yet a trait in AusTraits, but will map it in as soon as I write a definition.
  question3: Can you provide the mean values for the soil characteristics you include in the SI - soil zone Si content and conductivity? Then I will map the species to their individual soil zones and include that information as soil properties?
  question4: I am working on a side-project for the DCCEEW right now, seeing if traits might correlate with the susceptibility of key threats, including Phytophthora cinnamomi. The strongest trait correlation that is emerging is with leaf P. I'm curious if you know if any of the species you studies are susceptible to Phytophthora? 7 of your study species are recorded as being NOT SUSCEPTIBLE, and none as SUSCEPTIBLE, but I'm just curious if you've seen any signs of Phytophthora at your study site.
  question5: I've just added "culm" as an allowed value for the trait "plant_photosynthetic_organ". You'll see I haven't yet defined it - this is just because I need to make the change in the AusTraits Plant Dictionary first and then import it.
