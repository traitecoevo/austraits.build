questions:
  contributor: Do you have a copy of the manuscript that isn't "locked"? (Some of
    the older AJB articles don't let you copy text from the pdf file, so I haven't
    yet added 'sampling strategy' or methods for each of the traits.) Either a pdf I can copy from or a word document are fine - I just need the methods information and can type it up if necessary.
  question2: We also have 'water_potential_50percent_lost_conductivity' (water potential
    at which 50% of conductivity is lost) and 'water_potential_88percent_lost_conductivity'
    as traits if you have extracted these values from your fitted lines (i.e. in Figure
    6).
  question3: We can also include photosynthetic rate (and other associated gas exchange
    parameters) as traits.
  question4: You will see that the location data for Royal NP don't plot on land. I've looked at both manuscripts and they both have the same lat/lon coordinates. Do you have the correct longitude for this site? (Otherwise I'll take a stab looking at a map.)
  question5: I've been struggling with the units for the conductivity measures. I've compared the values in Table 3 from McClenahan_2004 and Figure 2 from Macinnis-Ng_2004 and your spreadsheet and various bits don't match. For now I've taken the liberty to align them with what puts your data in line with other studies, but would like to figure out which numbers to use. (I've tried re-creating some of your values from the table in McClenahan 2004 and haven't been completely successful either.)
