  description: Study to investigate convergence in hydraulic architecture, water relations
    traits, and gas exchange across the Sydney region.
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: VEGETATION ATTRIBUTES, MICROCLIMATE AND SOIL MOISTURE Each 1-ha
    site in each habitat was divided into two plots to provide replication at each
    site. These plots were treated as separate replicates until the analysis stage
    where they were pooled when statistics showed they were not significantly different.
    Tree height was determined for 15-20 randomly chosen trees in each plot in each
    habitat using a clinometer. Diameter at breast height (DBH) was determined for
    each of these trees (only trees over 2 m high were measured). DBH was not determined
    in the heathland as all vegetation was below 2 m. Foliage Projective Cover (FPC)
    was calculated for each site by holding a mirror at 45 degrees and recording whether
    the sky or foliage covered the central point of the mirror whilst walking a series
    of transects at each location. Data were recorded every meter along four transects
    of 25 m in length and the presence or absence of foliage was used to calculate
    the percentage cover as a proportion of the total number of sampling points (Specht
    1981). As the canopy was not overhead in the heathland a downward facing mirror
    was used to measure the frequency of leaves or bare soil along the transect. Root
    biomass of the upper soil profile was determined in each habitat by collecting
    three random samples in each plot (a total of six samples per habitat). A volume
    of 8000 cm3 of soil was collected to a depth of 20 cm. Roots were extracted from
    each sample and washed thoroughly before being placed in an oven at 70 deg C for
    three days and then weighed. Wet and dry bulb temperatures were recorded with
    a whirling hydrometer every 90 min starting at 0600 hours and finishing at 1700
    hours. From the wet and dry bulb temperatures relative humidity and vapor pressure
    deficit (VPD) were calculated. Air temperature was recorded with a thermometer
    every 90 min in the shade and sun at each site, where possible. Relative humidity
    and VPD were measured for each day of leaf water potential sampling. Soil moisture
    was measured using a Theta Probe Soil Moisture Sensor (Delta-T Devices Ltd, ML2x).
    Ten measurements were randomly made per plot every 90 min and soil content recorded
    in volts. These measurements were calibrated by collecting soil samples from each
    site with a range of water contents and determining their gravimetric water content
    and soil moisture content recorded with the theta probe. Mean monthly rainfall
    and temperature data for Sydney airport and Marsfield/Macquarie University were
    obtained from the Bureau of Meteorology. These are the closest meteorological
    stations to Royal National Park and Crosslands Reserve, respectively.

  entity_type: individual

  basis_of_value: measurement

  methods: Huber values were calculated as the branch transverse area per leaf area.
    The diameter of the basal end of each branch was measured using a micrometer and
    the length of each branch was measured with a ruler. Leaf area attached to each
    branch was determined with a WinDIAS (Type WDIGC-2 Delta-T Devices Ltd, UK) leaf
    area meter. Sapwood cross-sectional area was determined by soaking thin sections
    of branch in 0.5% toluidine blue solution. The stained sapwood area was measured
    with a calibrated eyepiece micrometer.

  methods: Hydraulic conductance was determined by the method described by Prior and
    Eamus (2000). Branches were collected before 0900 hours to avoid the diurnal period
    of most stress. Two terminal branches (no less than 3 times as long as the longest
    vessel) were cut under water for each of three plants in each of the two plots,
    for the determination of hydraulic conductance. These branches were placed upright
    in a container of water and covered with a black plastic bag to reduce transpiration
    during the 60-90-min trip to the laboratory. Once in the laboratory all leaves
    and petioles were removed under water with a razor blade. Basal and distal ends
    of the branch were both re-cut under water. Branches were then connected to graduated
    1-mL pipettes via tubing filled with degassed, filtered (0.22 um), acidified (pH
    2, HCl; Sperry et al. 1994) water. Hydraulic conductance was determined using
    two vacuum systems approximately 2 m long and 30 cm wide, each of which could
    accommodate three branches. The solution was pulled through the branch in the
    normal direction of the transpiration stream by applying a vacuum to the chamber.
    Flow rate of the acidified de-gassed water was measured at four levels of vacuum
    (pressure difference (delta P) = 20, 30, 40 and 50 kPa), which was measured with
    a vacuum gauge (Leybold, Germany). Branches were allowed to reach an equilibrium
    flow rate before flow rate was recorded. Hydraulic conductance (kg s-1 MPa-1)
    was calculated as the slope of the relationship between flow rate and pressure
    difference using linear regression. Hydraulic conductivity (kg s-1 m MPa-1) was
    calculated by multiplying the conductance by the branch length and was expressed
    in terms of leaf area, sapwood area and branch transverse area.

  methods: Pre-dawn and diurnal leaf water potentials were determined for each species

    USA). Measurements were taken every 90-min throughout the day between 0630 hours
    and 1600 hours. Leaf water potential from randomly selected trees was determined
    for one leaf from each of two branches, from three trees of each species, in each
    of the two plots in each habitat. Mean pre-dawn water potential and mean minimum
    water potential (generally the sample collected between 1200 and 1300 hours) was

  entity_type: population

  methods: Measurements made in summer; Light-saturated photosynthesis (Amax) was
    measured with an HCM-1000 portable infrared gas analyser (IRGA; Walz, portable
    photosynthesis system HCM-1000 handbook, Germany) operated in differential mode.
    Measurements of intact, fully expanded leaves were taken in the morning (between
    0930 hours and 1130 hours local time) between May and August (winter) 2001 and
    in February and March (summer) 2002. Leaves were in full sunlight at the time
    of sampling and light-saturating conditions (PAR > 1000 umol m-2 s-1) were used
    throughout the study. Ambient levels of atmospheric CO2, humidity and temperatures
    were maintained in the leaf chamber at the start of each measurement period. Three
    leaves, on each of three plants, in each of two plots, for each species, were
    sampled.

  contributor: I've been struggling with the units for the conductivity measures.
    I've compared the values in Table 3 from McClenahan_2004 and Figure 2 from Macinnis-Ng_2004
    and your spreadsheet and various bits don't match. For now I've taken the liberty
    to align them with what puts your data in line with other studies, but would like
    to figure out which numbers to use. (I've tried re-creating some of your values
    from the table in McClenahan 2004 and haven't been completely successful either.)
