  sampling_strategy: 'Stems of 22 tree species were collected in 2013 from Agnes Banks
    Nature Reserve, Castlereagh Nature Reserve, and the Cumberland Plain SuperSite
    of the Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Network, all located in the Hawkesbury region
    of Sydney, NSW, Australia. Live stems from at least three individuals of eachspecies
    were collected and divided into two stem-diameter classes, 1-2 cm (small size
    class; all species except Eucalyptus sclerophylla) and 5-9 cm (large sizeclass;
    12 species). Species that were not represented in the large size class do not
    naturally produce stems of that diameter size (Appendix S1, Fig. S1).'

  methods: 'Sawdust was generated from three replicate stems each for both small and
    large wood samples and stored at 20 deg C until processing for DNA extraction
    and chemical analysis (see below). Shavings from each of the three stems were
    kept separate in subsequent analyses (n = 3). To assess wood density and bark
    thickness, three small 10- cm-length stem segments for each tree species were
    used (see below). To assess wood water content, at least four additional small
    and large stem segments for each species were used (see below). Wood traits, including
    bark thickness, water content, and density, were measured within 2 weeks of stem
    collections, using methods described in Perez-Harguindeguy et al. (2013) and Osazuwa-Peters
    and Zanne (2011; Appendix S2: Wood trait data collection).'

    chemical analysis on a composite sample of all three small stems for each species
    because of limited sample volumes (n = 1). Elemental concentrations were measured
    on 150 mg of dried, milled wood (Appendix S2: Wood trait data collection). Carbon
    (C) and nitrogen (N) concentrations were measured using a TruMac CN Macro analyzer
    (Leco, St. Joseph, Michigan, USA).'
