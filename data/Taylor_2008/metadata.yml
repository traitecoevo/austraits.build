  description: 'We studied relationships among branch hydraulic conductivity, xylem
    embolism, stomatal conductance (gs), foliar nitrogen (N) concentration and specific
    leaf area (SLA) of seven tree species growing at four temperate woodland sites
    spanning a 464-1350 mm rainfall gradient. Specifically, we examined the question:
    are gs and foliar N concentration coordinated with branch hydraulic conductivity
    and, if so, what are the implications for carbon assimilation?'
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: We measured area-based, light-saturated photosynthetic rate (Aa),
    gs, leaf N concentration, SLA, hydraulic architecture and branch structural traits
    at four woodland sites differing in mean annual rainfall. At each site, we established
    a single 50 x 50 m plot within which 10 randomly selected trees were chosen for
    sampling. Individual trees were selected by dividing the quadrat into sub-quadrats
    of about 2 x 2 m, selecting 10 sub-quadrats based on a table of random numbers
    and choosing a single tree within each sub-quadrat. All sampling was conducted
    in summer, between December 2005 and February 2006. All branches and leaves sampled
    were free of disease and insect damage.

  methods: 'A single, sun-exposed branch was cut from the upper crown of each tree
    of each sub-quadrat, and the cut end immediately placed in a bottle of distilled
    water. A Walz HCM-1000 portable infrared gas analyzer (Walz, Effeltrich, Germany)
    measured Aa and gs in two young fully expanded leaves per branch within 5 min
    of immersing the cut end of the branch in water. All measurements were taken between
    0900 and 1100 h (Australian Eastern Standard Time) at ambient CO2 concentrations
    and temperatures and at solar irradiances exceeding 1000 umol m-2 s-1 photosynthetic
    photon flux. We validated that measurements made on excised branches did not differ
    from measurements made on attached branches by randomly selecting three trees
    of each species, choosing a single accessible sun-exposed branch from each tree
    and measuring Aa and gs. We then excised each branch, placed it in distilled water
    and measured Aa and gs at 5-min intervals for 15 min. We found no difference between
    Aa and gs of attached and detached branches over this time period, and neither
    variable declined significantly over the 15-min period (repeated measures ANOVA;
    insignificant time main effect; P > 0.5 for all species; data not shown). Our
    measurements of Aa and gs do not represent maximum rates of CO2 assimilation and
    gs, which are usually measured under conditions of non-limiting light, temperature
    and water availability. Although our measurements of Aa and gs are not temperature
    or light limited, soil water may have been limiting at many of the sites because
    the region experienced drought during the measurement period. Thus, our measurements
    of Aa and gs represent maximum observed rates of CO2 assimilation and gs at the
    time and place of sampling, not maximum rates for each species/tree examined.
    Atmospheric water content and leaf temperature were not controlled during the
    measurements, but leaves were sampled only under saturating light conditions.
    In some cases, individual leaves were too small to cover the entire area of the
    measuring cuvette. In these cases, we removed the leaf portion in the cuvette
    and measured its area with a Li-Cor LI-3000A leaf area meter. Photosynthetic rates
    were then recalculated: Aa = (Ameasured x cuvette area)/projected leaf area. Stomatal
    conductance was similarly recalculated. For needle-leaved Callitris trees, gas
    exchange rates were expressed on a needle surface area rather than on a projected
    area basis. We assumed that Callitris needles were cylindrical and Aa was subsequently
    modified to Aa = (Ameasured x cuvette area)/ 0.5(projected leaf area x Pi).'

  entity_type: individual
  value_type: raw
  basis_of_value: measurement
  replicates: 1
  methods: Branch hydraulic conductivity (k; ml cm s-1 MPa-1) was measured as described
    by Macinnis-Ng et al. (2004). The terminal segments of branches of 3-6 mm diameter
    were selected from the sunlit portion of the canopy. Only current-year growth
    was sampled, so that the leaves on the branch were those formed during the current
    growing season. The branch and all leaves from each branch (at the petiole-branch
    junction) were excised under distilled water to prevent embolism. The basal end
    of each branch was recut underwater about 5 mm from the point of excision. Branches
    were then inserted into the lid of a custom-built vacuum chamber. The basal end
    of each branch was quickly connected with flexible tubing to a 1-cm3 graduated
    pipette filled with distilled, filtered (0.22 um) and acidified (pH 2.0 with 10%
    hydrochloric acid; Sperry et al. 1994) water. Hydraulic conductivity was measured
    by increasing the pressure in the vacuum chamber in five steps (deltaP ~ -20,
    -30, -40, -50 and -60 kPa). At each pressure, sap flow (ml s-1) was measured by
    recording the rate of change in volume of water in the pipette. Branches were
    allowed to equilibrate at each pressure for 10 min before measurement began. Hydraulic
    conductivity was calculated as the ordinary least-squares regression slope of
    the relationship between sap flow and deltaP/l, where l is length of the branch
    segment (Prior and Eamus 2000). Previous work has established that the absence
    of salts from the perfusion solution does not affect the value of conductivity
    obtained (Prior and Eamus 2000, Macinnis-Ng et al. 2004). There was no evidence
    that flow rates declined with time in the vacuum chamber.

    the branch hydraulic conductivity measurements, sapwood and leaf areas of each
    branch were measured. Sapwood area was determined by dipping thin cross sections
    of branch in methyl orange and measuring the diameter of the stained (heartwood)
    and unstained (sapwood) sections with a calibrated eyepiece micrometer. Leaf area
    distal to the basal end of each branch was measured with a leaf area meter (Li-Cor
    LI-3000A). Sapwood-specific, branch hydraulic conductivity (ks) was calculated
    by dividing the conductivity of a branch by its sapwood area.

questions:
  contributor: The units for ks and kl in the data file we received (attached to report)
    seem to be incorrect. They are reported as 'ml/s/m/mpa/cm2' for ks (sapwood_specific_conductivity)
    and 'ml/s/m/mPa/.m2' (leaf_specific_conductivity). We are assuming these mean
    that, for sapwood specific conductivity, sapwood cross-sectional area is reported
    in cm2 and for leaf specific conductivity, leaf area of the twig sampled is report
    in m2. If we make these assumptions we do not get "reasonable" values for ks and
    kl and the values we get for ks do not align with those reported in the manuscript.
    We have had to multiply your values by 10^3 to align them with values reported
    in other studies.
  question_2: Many of your values for photosynthetic rate are very low - the lowest
    values reported in AusTraits. They align with those reported in your manuscript,
    but wanted to confirm these are indeed so low. Your methods indicate they were
    taken under saturating light conditions and therefore we've aligned them to "photosynthetic_rate_per_dry_mass_saturated"
    and "photosynthetic_rate_per_area_saturated".
