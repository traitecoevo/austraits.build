  description: Study investigating community-wide hydraulic vulnerability segmentation
    by comparing leaf/shoot and stem vulnerability in dominant species of a diverse
    dry sclerophyll woodland community.
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: This study was conducted on the east coast of Tasmania, Australia.
    At the study site, the woody vegetation consisted of two canopy layers - a 5–20
    m overstory and a 1–3 m understory (Skelton, Brodribb, McAdam, et al., 2017).
    We selected the eight dominant woody species from this site, which consisted of
    four canopy trees species that included one gymnosperm and three angiosperm and
    four angiosperm understory shrubs (Table 1). We measured xylem embolism formation
    in stems using the optical vulnerability technique (Brodribb et al., 2017). For
    each species, branches from three individuals were collected from the study site.
    We cut the branches early in the morning (~6.00 a.m.) to ensure that they were
    hydrated, and once cut, we immediately sealed them in plastic bag with moist paper
    towels to make sure that they were kept hydrated while being transported back
    to the laboratory at the University of Tasmania. All branches were over 1 m in
    length to reduce the likelihood of any open vessels being present in the distal
    parts of the branch. Small distal branches, c. 0.3 cm in diameter, with healthy
    foliage were chosen and a length of bark (c. 2 cm) was carefully removed to expose
    the xylem. ^p Due to the very small size of leaves in some species (including
    their reduction to scales in Callitris and Allocasuarina), it was not possible
    to employ the optical method in all these species. Hence, leaf vulnerability to
    water deficit curves was extracted from Skelton, Brodribb, McAdam, et al. (2017),
    where the same plant community of trees and shrubs was measured in 2016. In this
    study, leaf hydraulic conductance (kleaf) was measured using the rehydration kinetics
    method on whole leaves or in the case of microphyllous leaves or needle leaves
    small terminal shoots were measured (Skelton, Brodribb, McAdam, et al., 2017).
    We extracted the xylem water potentials associated with 12% (P12 kleaf, MPa) and
    50% (P50 kleaf, MPa) loss of kleaf. ^p HSM were calculated as the difference between
    Ψ min and P12 (P12 HSM), P50 (P50 HSM) and P88 (P88 HSM) embolism extracted from
    OVC. Midday leaf water potential (Ψmin) was taken from Skelton, Brodribb, McAdam,
    et al. (2017) when water potential was measured on the same plant community during
    the end of a severe drought caused by the 2015–2016 El Niño Pacific southern oscillation
    (Table S1).

    precipitation, description: Rainfall is sporadic throughout the year without a
      clear wet or dry season and mean annual rainfall at a nearby location (Swansea,
      <10 km away) is ~600–700 mm (Australian Bureau of Meteorology).
    vegetation type: Evergreen dry sclerophyll woodland
    description: This study was conducted on the east coast of Tasmania, Australia.
      Vegetation at our study site is evergreen dry sclerophyll woodland. Woodlands
      originally covered close to 30% of the Australian continent including Tasmania
      and are often dominated by Callitris spp., Casuarina spp., Eucalyptus spp. and
      Melaleuca spp. (Lindenmayer, Crane, & Michael, 2005). At the study site, the
      woody vegetation consisted of two canopy layers - a 5–20 m overstory and a 1–3
      m understory (Skelton, Brodribb, McAdam, et al., 2017). We selected the eight
      dominant woody species from this site, which consisted of four canopy trees
      species that included one gymnosperm and three angiosperm and four angiosperm
      understory shrubs (Table 1).
