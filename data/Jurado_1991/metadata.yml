  description: trait data for species at Kunnoth Paddock Alice Springs
  basis_of_record: field, preserved_specimen
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: Diaspore mass and dispersal structures were described for 230
    taxa, 229 species and one variety (Appendix). These include 19% of the species,
    26% of the genera and 28% of the families in the Central Southern Region of the
    Northern Territory (Dunlop 1987). Eleven (< 5%) of the species studied are naturalized
    in the region (four grasses and seven forbs).

    description: Collections were made in open woodlands, floodplains and mulga country
      around Alice Springs (23 deg 42' S, 133 deg 52' E), Northern Territory. Alice
      Springs has an arid climate, with a mean annual rainfall of 263 mm, of which
      70% falls in summer (Low 1978). The average maximum and minimum temperatures
      are 35 deg C and 21 deg C in the hottest month and 19 deg C and 4 deg C in the
      coldest (Low 1978). The exact location was in Kunoth Paddock on Hamilton Downs
      Station to the north-west of Alice Springs. Rainfall values are for Alice Springs.

    Data from published flora. Data on some attributes such as growth form, leaf texture
    and hairiness, flowering characteristics, presence of spines and seed dispersal
    mode could be collected from observations of each species in the field. Where
    field specimens were inadequate, herbarium specimens were used. Data on morphological
    features that could not be reliably collected from field specimens were obtained
    from exhaustive reviews of the literature. These features included maximum height
    gained, presence of storage organ, depth of root system and presence of secondary
    compounds.

  methods: The term diaspore is used when referring to the seed and dispersal structures.
    Fresh diaspores were used for most species, and were collected from November 1987
    to March 1989. Winter and summer ephemerals as well as perennials were included.
    Diaspores were collected from as many individuals as possible (n > 10). Specimens
    from two existing seed collections were also used to increase the number of the
    species described. Twenty diaspores were weighed for each species, except for
    a few species for which only a small number of diaspores were available (n always
    > 10). Diaspores were dried at 80C for 24 h before being individually weighed
    to the nearest 10-6 g. The five diaspores closest to the mean weight of each species
    were dissected, and parts (seed coat, reserve, husks and dispersal structure)
    were weighed separately. When diaspores had more than one seed, weight was expressed
    on a per-seed basis.

  trait_name: dispersal_syndrome
  entity_type: species
  value_type: mode
  basis_of_value: expert_score

  methods: Species were classified into dispersal categories according to the presence
    of structures on the seed, (i) unassisted; seeds with no apparent dispersal structure;
    (ii) flesh, red and yellow arils or glue-like sweet substances (referred to as
    bird- dispersed); (iii) elaiosome (white arils, ant-dispersed); (iv) adhesive
    structures or substances associated with external dispersion by animals (adhesive);
    (v) structures enhancing air resistance (wind-dispersed). Species categorized
    as unassisted should not be regarded as undispersed. Indeed this category included
    species with very small seeds borne in the uppermost part of the plant that are
    likely to be wind-dispersed to considerable distances. Other species included
    in this category could be dispersed by herbivores that eat seeds while feed- ing
    on the mother plant and excrete viable seeds later (Janzen 1971). Because of the
    lack of evidence of actual dispersal achieved by seeds, however, the presence
    of structures was the sole consideration in classifying dispersal. Thus the terms
    ant-, bird- and wind-dispersed and adhesive are used for seeds having distinct
    structures associated with a syndrome, and therefore likely to be dispersed by
    those agents. Some of the species classified here as having adhesive diaspores
    (e.g. Aristida spp.) have been reported to have hygroscopic awns that are active
    means of sec- ondary dispersal and not structures for passive dispersal (Peart
    1979). However, such structures could be associated both with passive dispersal
    on the skin of mam- mals and active dispersal on the soil surface. Some of the
    awned diaspores remain in the inflorescence well beyond the time of seed maturity
    (E. Jurado, personal observation). The elevation and exposure of the awned diaspores
    could be an adaptation for more-efficient attachment to the skin of passing mammals.
    Moreover, some diaspores stuck to the arms of one of the authors during collection.

  methods: Plant perenniality was assessed following the criteria from Jessop (1981),
    plus a classification of perennials according to an estimation of maximum years
    of growth as assessed by the field experience of one of the authors (D. Nelson).
    The perenniality classes were, annual; short-lived and facultative perennial (a
    lifespan < 5 years); perennial with an upper lifespan of 5-10 years; perennial
    with an upper lifespan of 10-20 years; perennial with an upper lifespan of 20-50
    years; perennial with an upper lifespan of 50-100 years; perennial with an upper
    lifespan of > 100 years. This classification is necessarily approximate, but it
    describes meaningful variation among the perennial species.
