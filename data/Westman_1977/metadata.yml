    catalyst by the Kjeldahl method. The same digest was analysed for phosphate ion

    (A.A.). Woody tissues digested in a concentrated nitric-sulphuric-perchloric acid
    mixture were analysed by the A.A. in the presence of lanthanum chloride for calcium,

  methods: Plant tissue samples were collected for analysis during mid-summer months.
    Samples from five individuals were dried to 104 deg C, ground, and bulked for
    analysis for each plant part. Woody tissue samples were analysed for organic and
    ammonium nitrogen after digestion in concentrated sulphuric acid and selenium
    catalyst by the Kjeldahl method. The same digest was analysed for phosphate ion
    using vanadomolybdate reagent, and for potassium ion on an atomic absorption spectrophotometer
    (A.A.). Woody tissues digested in a concentrated nitric-sulphuric-perchloric acid
    mixture were analysed by the A.A. in the presence of lanthanum chloride for calcium,
    magnesium and sodium ions, and in the absence of lanthanum chloride for iron,
    copper, manganese and zinc ions. Chloride ion was analysed by A.A. on tissue boiled
    slowly for 1 h in deionized water. Woody tissue analyses were performed by Consolidated
    Fertilizers Pty. Ltd.
