    Samples from five individuals were dried to 104 deg C, ground, and bulked for

    ammonium nitrogen after digestion in concentrated sulphuric acid and selenium
    catalyst by the Kjeldahl method. The same digest was analysed for phosphate ion
    using vanadomolybdate reagent, and for potassium ion on an atomic absorption spectrophotometer
    (A.A.). Woody tissues digested in a concentrated nitric-sulphuric-perchloric acid
    mixture were analysed by the A.A. in the presence of lanthanum chloride for calcium,
    magnesium and sodium ions, and in the absence of lanthanum chloride for iron,
    copper, manganese and zinc ions. Chloride ion was analysed by A.A. on tissue boiled
