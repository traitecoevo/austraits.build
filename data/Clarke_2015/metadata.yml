  description: Collection of resprouting data from across all Australian ecosystems
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: "From existing data in 6031 plots comprising the presenceâ€“absence of
    3421 woody plant taxa (species and subspecies, forms and variants), we collated records of fire 
    resprouting (resprouting R+ or killed R-) and postfire seedling recruitment (seeding S+ or non-seeding S-) 
    for 2880 of these taxa from all the major ecosystems in Australia (see Fig. 2a; Appendix 1). These ecosystems 
    were rainforest (tropical, warm temperate and cool temperate), eucalypt forest (wet and dry sclerophyll), savanna 
    (tropical and temperate), eucalypt shrubland (mallee), Acacia shrubland (brigalow, gidgee and mulga), heath (tropical and temperate),'tussock' grassland
    (C4 tropical and subtropical), and 'hummock' spinifex grassland (Groves, 2001). The dataset was assembled from pre-existing 
    data collected by the authors, with care taken to ensure consistency of attribution of fire responses to taxa, although some slight inconsistency may exist. 
    Plots ranged in size from 25 m2 for heath to 1000 m2 for savanna and forest. Only native woody taxa, including those 'herbaceous' taxa with woody underground structures,
    were included in the analyses. Evidence of R+ and S+ is more conspicuous in the postfire environment than evidence of R- and S- , and accordingly unattributed taxa may be over-represented by R- 
    and S-. We are unable to evaluate the extent to which this may have occurred but our attribution method is consistent with similar analyses globally (Clarke et al., 2009; 
    Pausas and Bradstock, 2007; Pausas et al., 2004; Russell-Smith et al., 2012). To compare proportions of resprouting and postfire seeding across all major Australian ecosystems,
    we collated the data (see Appendix 1) in the following steps. First, all 6031 plots were assigned to one of eight broad ecosystem types. Second, each of the 2880 taxa were 
    attributed by growth form, resprouting type, and postfire seeding type. The growth form of all woody taxa was determined from field observations, flora records and published
    records and classified by leaf type and then height classes into one of nine growth form classes (Table 1). These classes were- tropical broadleaved evergreen trees; tropical broadleaved deciduous trees; 
    temperate broadleaved evergreen trees; needle-leaved trees, arborescent monocots, cycads and ferns; shrubs; subshrubs; climbers and scramblers; and parasites (Alexander and Millington, 2000; Kuchler, 1967). 
    These classes were used because they represent a set of woody growth forms used in Dynamic Global Vegetation Models (DGVMs; e.g. Sitch et al., 2008). The richness of taxa in the growth form classes reflected
    the sampling intensity across the ecosystems, with more taxa recorded in the intensely sampled eucalypt forests of eastern Australia than, for example, rainforests that are more species rich (Table 1). 
    Because sampling intensity confounds the use of absolute richness, we report resprouting and seeding patterns as proportions within growth form classes and ecosystems. The responses of woody taxa to fire were recorded
    from direct observations in the postfire environment for taxa exposed to varying levels of fire from surface- to crown-fires. Surface fires burn on the surface of the ground, while crown fires burn and spread
    through the crowns or canopies of trees or shrubs. Crown fires tend to be of much higher intensity than surface fires (Murphy et al., 2013). The responses of some species to fire were confirmed at multiple locations,
    thereby providing a level of confidence in assigning taxa to fire response classes. In some instances, fire response was inferred from plant architecture, e.g. presence of lignotubers, and by comparing this with the
    response of closely related coexisting taxa."

  notes: Information on fire resprouting traits should also be linked to life history traits/growth form, but not in the data file online or in the one Michael Lawes has. Hopefully this information is in AusTraits through herbarium records for the same species.

  methods: 'Expert field observations:  The position of resprouts was identified as apical, basal, epicormic, or underground. Basal and underground resprouting were distinguished by basal resprouting being from the base of the stem while underground resprouting was from the root stock (P.J. Clarke et al., 2013). If more than one resprouting type was observed for a taxon then the most common resprouting type was recorded.'
- var_in: R+
  unit_in: .na
  trait_name: fire_response
  value_type: expert_mean

  methods: Taxawere classified as resprouters (R+; 70-100% of individuals in the population resprouted) or non-resprouters (R-; less than 30% of individuals in a population resprouted) (Gill and Bradstock, 1992), although a third resprouting class (variable, V)where 31-69% of individuals in a population resprouted,was also noted (Clarke et al., 2005). A taxonwas scored as a non-resprouter if all of its records were R-, or ifmost records were R- and the remaining were variable. Taxa that experienced complete canopy scorch and died were classified as R-. Conversely, a taxon was scored as a resprouter if all of its records were R+, most were R+ and the remaining were V, or if all records of population response were V. In the rare instance where there were equal proportions of R-, V, and R+ records for a taxon, it was scored as a resprouter (R+). 
- var_in: S+

  trait_name: fire-cued_seeding

  methods: In addition to data on resprouting response and type, the seed bank response was assessed for each taxon as either postfire seeder (S+) or non-seeder (S-).We used three explicit criteria to identify a taxon that persisted by fire-cued recruitment. Seeder species (S+) had a seed bank that was long-lived (N1 year), the release and/or germination of their seeds was stimulated by fire, and/or they displayed immediate postfire recruitment from seed (Pausas et al., 2004; Pausas and Keeley, 2014). Accordingly, we classified the flora as resprouters (R+) or non-resprouters (R-), and seeders (S+) or non-seeders (S-).
