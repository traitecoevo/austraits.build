  description: Collection of resprouting data from across all Australian ecosystems
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: From existing data in 6031 plots comprising the presence-absence
    of 3421 woody plant taxa (species and subspecies, forms and variants), we collated
    records of fire resprouting (resprouting R+ or killed R-) and postfire seedling
    recruitment (seeding S+ or non-seeding S-) for 2880 of these taxa from all the
    major ecosystems in Australia (see Fig. 2a; Appendix 1). These ecosystems were
    rainforest (tropical, warm temperate and cool temperate), eucalypt forest (wet
    and dry sclerophyll), savanna (tropical and temperate), eucalypt shrubland (mallee),
    Acacia shrubland (brigalow, gidgee and mulga), heath (tropical and temperate),'tussock'
    grassland (C4 tropical and subtropical), and 'hummock' spinifex grassland (Groves,
    2001). The dataset was assembled from pre-existing data collected by the authors,
    with care taken to ensure consistency of attribution of fire responses to taxa,
    although some slight inconsistency may exist. Plots ranged in size from 25 m2
    for heath to 1000 m2 for savanna and forest. Only native woody taxa, including
    those 'herbaceous' taxa with woody underground structures, were included in the
    analyses. Evidence of R+ and S+ is more conspicuous in the postfire environment
    than evidence of R- and S- , and accordingly unattributed taxa may be over-represented
    by R- and S-. We are unable to evaluate the extent to which this may have occurred
    but our attribution method is consistent with similar analyses globally (Clarke
    et al., 2009; Pausas and Bradstock, 2007; Pausas et al., 2004; Russell-Smith et
    al., 2012). To compare proportions of resprouting and postfire seeding across
    all major Australian ecosystems, we collated the data (see Appendix 1) in the
    following steps. First, all 6031 plots were assigned to one of eight broad ecosystem
    types. Second, each of the 2880 taxa were attributed by growth form, resprouting
    type, and postfire seeding type. The growth form of all woody taxa was determined
    from field observations, flora records and published records and classified by
    leaf type and then height classes into one of nine growth form classes (Table
    1). These classes were- tropical broadleaved evergreen trees; tropical broadleaved
    deciduous trees; temperate broadleaved evergreen trees; needle-leaved trees, arborescent
    monocots, cycads and ferns; shrubs; subshrubs; climbers and scramblers; and parasites
    (Alexander and Millington, 2000; Kuchler, 1967). These classes were used because
    they represent a set of woody growth forms used in Dynamic Global Vegetation Models
    (DGVMs; e.g. Sitch et al., 2008). The richness of taxa in the growth form classes
    reflected the sampling intensity across the ecosystems, with more taxa recorded
    in the intensely sampled eucalypt forests of eastern Australia than, for example,
    rainforests that are more species rich (Table 1). Because sampling intensity confounds
    the use of absolute richness, we report resprouting and seeding patterns as proportions
    within growth form classes and ecosystems. The responses of woody taxa to fire
    were recorded from direct observations in the postfire environment for taxa exposed
    to varying levels of fire from surface- to crown-fires. Surface fires burn on
    the surface of the ground, while crown fires burn and spread through the crowns
    or canopies of trees or shrubs. Crown fires tend to be of much higher intensity
    than surface fires (Murphy et al., 2013). The responses of some species to fire
    were confirmed at multiple locations, thereby providing a level of confidence
    in assigning taxa to fire response classes. In some instances, fire response was
    inferred from plant architecture, e.g. presence of lignotubers, and by comparing
    this with the response of closely related coexisting taxa.

  notes: Information on fire resprouting traits should also be linked to life history
    traits/growth form, but not in the data file online or in the one Michael Lawes
    has. Hopefully this information is in AusTraits through herbarium records for
    the same species.

  methods: 'Expert field observations:  The position of resprouts was identified as
    apical, basal, epicormic, or underground. Basal and underground resprouting were
    distinguished by basal resprouting being from the base of the stem while underground
    resprouting was from the root stock (P.J. Clarke et al., 2013). If more than one
    resprouting type was observed for a taxon then the most common resprouting type
    was recorded.'

  methods: Taxawere classified as resprouters (R+; 70-100% of individuals in the population
    resprouted) or non-resprouters (R-; less than 30% of individuals in a population
    resprouted) (Gill and Bradstock, 1992), although a third resprouting class (variable,
    V)where 31-69% of individuals in a population resprouted,was also noted (Clarke
    et al., 2005). A taxonwas scored as a non-resprouter if all of its records were
    R-, or ifmost records were R- and the remaining were variable. Taxa that experienced
    complete canopy scorch and died were classified as R-. Conversely, a taxon was
    scored as a resprouter if all of its records were R+, most were R+ and the remaining
    were V, or if all records of population response were V. In the rare instance
    where there were equal proportions of R-, V, and R+ records for a taxon, it was
    scored as a resprouter (R+).

  trait_name: fire_cued_seeding
  value_type: expert_mean

  methods: In addition to data on resprouting response and type, the seed bank response
    was assessed for each taxon as either postfire seeder (S+) or non-seeder (S-).We
    used three explicit criteria to identify a taxon that persisted by fire-cued recruitment.
    Seeder species (S+) had a seed bank that was long-lived (N1 year), the release
    and/or germination of their seeds was stimulated by fire, and/or they displayed
    immediate postfire recruitment from seed (Pausas et al., 2004; Pausas and Keeley,
    2014). Accordingly, we classified the flora as resprouters (R+) or non-resprouters
    (R-), and seeders (S+) or non-seeders (S-).
