  description: This is an alpine species dataset collected between Mt Nelse-Bogong
    High Plains-Mt Hotham in Victoria. The dataset might also include some data from
    John Morgan's database not specifically associated with a campaign
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: This is an alpine species dataset collected between Mt Nelse-Bogong
    High Plains-Mt Hotham in Victoria.
  original_file: relevent data from the file "2014  updated plant functional trait
    database.xls" extracted. Original copy of the excel file located in Google Drive
    in the folder "Morgan_2011_1 Morgan_2011_2 Morgan_2014 Angevin_2010 Briggs_2010
    Cross_2011 Lunt_2012 Roberts_2006 Scott_2010"
  notes: This dataset might also include some data from John Morgan's database not
    specifically associated with a campaign; there are 10 duplicate values with Venn_2011,
    but these are spread across species and traits without any notable pattern, and
    are left in.

    georeference remarks: lat/lon for location near Bogong High Plains Road given,
      but data more broadly collected between Mt Nelse-Bogong High Plains-Mt Hotham
