  description: This report presents the results of flora and fauna surveys conducted
    by Environment ACT in the first few months following the 2003 wildfires that burnt
    70% (164,914 hectares) of the ACT including 90% of Namadgi National Park and Tidbinbilla
    Nature Reserve.
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: Overview ^p The sites used in surveys (Figure 1.3) covered a
    wide range of vegetation types, from tall wet forests through woodlands to open
    grasslands, as well as the full spectrum of fire severity categories. In addition
    to these sites, other sites surveyed for threatened fauna species or species of
    conservation concern are described in Chapters 3 and 4. Surveys commenced on 3
    February 2003, with detailed data collection commencing mid-February 2003 and
    continuing until the end of May 2003. ^p Methods ^p As detailed in Chapter 1,
    the objectives for flora surveys were to identify the extent and severity of the
    fires on areas containing species and ecological communities at risk, and to identify
    the response of these species. To meet the objectives, known plant species and
    ecological communities occurring within the areas affected by the wildfires were
    considered for assessment. Not all species and communities could be surveyed due
    to the large numbers of species that occur in the ACT (approximately 1500 native
    species). Selection of species and communities for assessment was based on one
    or more of the following characteristics, * known to be uncommon or have restricted
    distribution in the ACT - eg White Box (Eucalyptus albens); * endemic species
    occurring in the ACT or region; * threatened species (declared vulnerable or endangered
    under ACT or Commonwealth legislation); * species that commonly die as a response
    to fire and rely on regeneration as seedlings - eg Alpine Ash (Eucalyptus delegatensis),
    Snow Gum (E. pauciflora) and River She-Oak (Casuarina cunninghamii); and * other
    species of interest, for instance those with unknown responses to fire such as
    Silver Banksia (Banksia marginata). A total of 12 communities and 35 species were
    selected for assessment. Details of the assessment of ten of these communities
    and the 35 species is presented in this chapter. The assessment of wetland communities
    (Riparian Vegetation and Sphagnum Bogs), is included in Chapter 4 - Aquatic and
    Wetland Ecosystems. Using satellite imagery and aerial photographs taken after
    the fire event, an assessment of the severity of the burns was undertaken for
    known locations of the 12 communities and 35 species. Sites were selected to sample
    each of the selected communities and species at least once. For some species such
    as Snow Gum, several sites were surveyed to sample a range of altitudes or burn
    severities. Site selection was made using vegetation maps, personal knowledge
    of locations of species and communities, and fire severity maps. Sites were then
    ground truthed for suitability. Eighty five sites (Figure 1.3) were surveyed in
    the field including 8 of the 9 Australian Alps Fire Ecology plots in Namadgi National
    Park (sites NA01-NA07, NA09). The surveys of fire impact on flora were undertaken
    in April and May 2003, three months after the fire event. Two field teams, each
    containing two people, undertook the surveys. At each site the location, slope,
    aspect, vegetation, scorch and flame height, percentage of burn and fire severity
    were recorded (see Chapter 1 for definition of severity). The regenerative mechanism
    (see box below) of all the dominant identifiable species present was also recorded.
    In total the fire response of about 200 species was assessed. Photos were taken
    of the site and the fire response of the vegetation. Copies of the forms used
    to record the data are presented in Appendix 1.

  notes: This report includes a map showing all the survey locations, but does not
    include a table with coordinates and severity of each survey location and therefore
    fire severity was not recorded for each record.
