  description: Dataset of plant functional traits from an obligate reseeder Eucalypt
    woodland to build a conceptual model that incorporates four critical ecological
    processes that also distinguish obligate-seeder woodlands from temperate woodlands
    dominated by resprouting eucalypts.
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: We established 72 plots along the western edge of the GWW, south-western
    Australia, near Karroun Hill (30 deg 14'S, 118 deg 30'E), Yellowdine (31 deg 17'S,
    119 deg 39'E)  and Parker Range (31 deg 47'S, 119 deg 37'E). This area has a semi-arid
    Mediterranean climate (see Gosper et al. 2013 for more climatic details). Plots
    had a dominant crown layer of E. salubris, sometimes in association with other
    Eucalyptus spp. The sample area contained large recent (<10 years) and older (>38
    years, but readily visible in 1972 Landsat imagery) fire scars and large areas
    with no evidence of contemporary fire. Plots were distributed in these age classes
    across the geographic spread of sampling, with additional plots 10-38 years post-fire
    sampled where such fires had occurred. Plot time since fire was determined through
    a combination of Landsat imagery analysis, growth ring counts and estimates based
    on E. salubris growth ring-size relationships (Gosper et al. 2013). We use the
    best two plausible models for estimating time since fire, (i) untransformed growth
    rings predicted by diameter at the base (D10) plus location (Model 2), and (ii)
    square-root-transformed growth rings predicted by D10 plus location (Model 5),
    acknowledging that the certainty of plot time since fire declines with increasing
    time, particularly beyond 200 years (Gosper et al. 2013). The sample age range
    was 2-370 (Model 2) or 2-1460 (Model 5) years post-fire (see Table S1, Supporting
    Information). Analyses were conducted using Model 2 times since fire, although
    for interpretation purposes, the equally valid alternative time-since-fire scale
    from Model 5 has been added to figures as a second x-axis or to text in parentheses.
    Information on other aspects of the fire regime other than time since fire was
    not available. Plots were 50 x 50 m and placed >250 m apart (>500 m apart for
    plots of the same time since fire) in relatively uniform vegetation within 1 km
    of vehicular tracks on public land. As fires across this landscape can be very
    large, sometimes exceeding 100 000 ha (McCaw & Hanstrum 2003), it was often necessary
    to place multiple plots within the one fire scar. Having multiple samples within
    individual fires potentially creates problems in disentangling time-since-fire
    effects from other factors (Hurlbert 1994). In using a 'space-for-time' approach,
    we assume that each of the different plots is truly comparable and that fire event
    effects (Bond & van Wilgen 1996) do not confound time-since-fire effects. Although
    there is subsequently a degree of uncertainty in attributing differences to time
    since fire alone, we have taken a number of steps to minimize the difficulties
    for interpretation. First, we sampled a broad geographic area, so overall a number
    of different fires were sampled for each time-since-fire class. Second, many of
    our analyses concentrate on the detection of trends over time, rather than solely
    determining differences between individual fires, which would be confounded by
    sampling a limited number of fire events. Third, the spread of plots of each time
    since fire across the study area suggests that systematic location bias confounding
    time-since-fire effects are unlikely. VEGETATION SAMPLING Plots were sampled in
    spring 2010 or spring 2011, with each time-since-fire class sampled in each year.
    To explore the impact of sampling effort on rates of species accumulation between
    times since fire, we tallied the cumulative number of taxa in nested plots of
    1, 5, 10, 25, 100, 500, 1000 and 2500 m2. Sampling plots over multiple sizes allow
    for an assessment of changes in the rates of species accumulation with area and
    help determine the appropriate scale at which comparisons should be made between
    times since fire.

questions:
  contributor: Is it correct that you only have time until first fruiting for just
    1 species? Is this simply the one species measured that wasn't included in the
    first dataset?
  question2: So far I've only included two of the references on the list. We want  the
    reference list to reflect the publications for which the data were first collected,
    not those where it was reanalysed to answer a separate question. I may well have
    got this wrong - so feel free to tell me that data were "collected" (from the
    literature, herbaria or field) for a different collection of papers than I've
    represented.
