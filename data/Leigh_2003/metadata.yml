  description: Investigation of sexual dimorphism in reproductive, morphological and

    a dioecious, semi-arid shrub endemic to Australia.
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: FIELD SITE, During October 2000, a population of M. pyramidata
    plants was studied at Lake Tyrrell, a salt lake surrounded by farmland in north-western
    Victoria, Australia. The species grows abundantly (0.5-2 m apart) along the side
    of a dirt road circling the lake, approximately 200 m from the lake edge. The
    road is elevated relative to the lake and shoreline by approximately 1-1.5 m,
    with M. pyramidata individuals existing only on the upper side of the road. The
    roadside verge has experienced heavy soil disturbance, probably within the previous
    10 years and many of the plants directly adjacent to the road have their lower
    stems covered by earth. STUDY PLANTS, Study plants were selected from within a
    100-m x 3-m plot. Although selection of individuals was random, plants were rejected
    if multiple buried stems prevented distinguishing them from other individuals
    or if they did not appear to be reproductively mature. The sex ratio of the population
    was determined by walking two 300-m transects, parallel and 3-m apart along the
    roadside, and recording the sex of the plant at every 2-m interval along each
    transect. The 2-m interval was used in order to ensure that different individuals
    were sampled at each interval. Soil moisture (down to approximately 7-cm depth)
    was measured beneath each plant with a Thetaprobe Model ML1 soil moisture meter.

traits:
- var_in: SLA
  unit_in: m2/kg
  trait_name: specific_leaf_area
  value_type: raw_value
  replicates: 1
  methods: For comparisons of vegetative characteristics, height, specific leaf area
    (SLA), the number of leaves per mm of stem and leaf mass (g) per gram of stem
    mass were determined on 20 plants per sex. For SLA measurements, samples were
    brought back to the laboratory in dampened paper bags on ice to prevent leaf tissue
    from drying and shrinking. Twenty healthy leaves from the tips of branchlets of
    each plant were digitally scanned and the area was analysed using the public domain
    NIH Image program (http://rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image/). Leaves were then oven-dried
    and weighed. For each plant, the total area of the 20 leaves was divided by their
    total mass to obtain SLA.
- var_in: chlorophyll
  unit_in: umol/m2
  trait_name: chlorophyll_per_area
  value_type: raw_value
  replicates: 1
  methods: To determine leaf chlorophyll content, leaves of the same 10 plants selected
    for nitrogen analysis were brought back to the laboratory on ice and scanned by
    using NIH Image to obtain leaf area. Samples were then frozen in liquid nitrogen
    and stored at -80 deg C until used for chlorophyll extraction and spectrophotometric
    determination (with a DU 640 Spectrophotometer, Beckman Instruments Inc.) following
    the method of Porra et al. (1989). Chlorophyll concentration was divided by leaf
    area to obtain an estimate of leaf chlorophyll content (chl a + chl b, umol m-2)
    for each plant.
- var_in: '% nitrogen'
  unit_in: '%'
  trait_name: leaf_N_per_dry_mass
  value_type: raw_value
  replicates: 1
  methods: Nitrogen content was determined by a semi-micro Kjeldahl technique (AOAC
    1984) on leaves of 10 randomly selected study plants of each sex, with leaves
    from female plants taken from fruiting branches. Duplicate samples for each plant
    were digested at 250 deg C for 15 min and then at 460 deg C for 1 h in a Tectator
    2012 heating block with 6 mL sulfuric acid and a selenium catalyst. Cooled samples
    were then distilled and titrated with a Gerhardt Vapodest-5 apparatus. The nitrogen
    readings for the replicates were averaged to obtain an estimate of percentage
    nitrogen for each plant.
- var_in: C-iso diff
  unit_in: per mille
  trait_name: leaf_delta13C
  value_type: raw_value
  replicates: 1
  methods: Leaf material from 10 plants of each sex was oven-dried and ground in a
    cyclone mill and passed through a 0.4-mm screen. Samples were subjected to a controlled
    combustion, catalytic oxidation and reduction, using a Carlo Erba 1110 Elemental
    Analyser. The resulting gas was analysed for d13C, the ratio of 13C:12C relative
    to a Pee Dee belemnite (PDB) standard (Farquhar et al. 1989), using a VG Isochrom-EA
    Mass Spectrometer.
- var_in: leaf_mass_to_stem_mass
  unit_in: g/g
  trait_name: leaf_mass_to_stem_mass
  value_type: raw_value
  replicates: 1
  methods: 'A ratio of leaf to stem mass was obtained by using the 28 sample branches
    used for estimating RA: A representative branch from 28 randomly chosen plants
    (14 of each sex) was used to obtain an estimate of RA per plant as it was not
    logistically feasible to calculate RA on a whole plant basis. Each branch was
    collected and placed in a paper bag to prevent loss of foliage, flowers and fruits.
    For each sample, stems, leaves, flowers and fruits were separated, oven-dried
    at 60 deg C for a minimum of 5 days and weighed.'
