questions: 
  contributor: Do you have any location information that can be associated with this data? Having the name of the national park or reserve where it was collected would be good.
  question2: Is plant height the maximum species height at the site or simply the height of the individual measured? We are only considered "maximum height" to be a trait. "Plant height" is considered an allometric property and excluded.
