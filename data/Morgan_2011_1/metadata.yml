  description: John Morgan Grassy woodland trait database
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: This data comes from a wide variety of sites and systems across
    Vicroria including Wimmera woodlands near Natimuk, Yellow Gum woodlands in western
    Victoria,Red Gum woodlands on the Dundas Tablelands, snowgum woodlands in Alpine
    National Park, coastal grassy woodlands at Wilsons Promontory National Park.
  original_file: relevent data from the file "2014  updated plant functional trait
    database.xls" extracted. Original copy of the excel file located in Google Drive
    in the folder "Morgan_2011_1 Morgan_2011_2 Morgan_2014 Angevin_2010 Briggs_2010
    Cross_2011 Lunt_2012 Roberts_2006 Scott_2010"
  notes: 68 (of325) plant height values are identical to entries in AusTraits from
    various botanical collections; no values have been filtered, because these 68
    values are across 7 different references, with no clear pattern, suggesting they
    are coincidental duplicates.
