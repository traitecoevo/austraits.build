questions:
  author: The referenced manuscript describes a chronosequence, but it
    seems that the submitted data was from a single "site". Is all the data from just
    a single point along the chronosequence? In order to fill in "sampling strategy"
    and more specific site information, it is important to know how the data submitted
    to austraits match with the results described in the publication. In addition,
    the trait data submitted to Austraits does not seem to be the same data presented
    in the Journal of Ecology paper - do you have methods for the trait data you have
    submitted?
