  description: Ecological datasets from the Jurien Bay dune chronosequence
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: 'For leaf sampling, we used 50 plots (10 m x 10 m each) from
    five chronosequence stages where vegetation had been characterised previously
    (see jurienveg and jurienplots for more details). Using the vegetation survey
    data (see jurienveg), we ranked species in each of the five chronosequence stages
    from the most to the least abundant, based on canopy cover estimates. We then
    selected 5-7 species from each stage, targeting the most abundant species for
    each of four contrasting nutrient-acquisition strategies: arbuscular mycorrhizal
    (AM), ectomycorrhizal (EM), N-fixing (NF) and non-mycorrhizal (NM) (see juriensp
    for strategies). Ericoid mycorrhizal species were not considered because they
    were not among the most abundant species. We note that N-fixing species are generally
    AM and/or EM, but we considered them as a separate group because they often show
    high foliar [N]. Species were selected from the ten most-abundant species per
    stage, with the exception of stage 4 where the 18 most-abundant species were considered.
    The selected species accounted for between 38% (stage 5) and 65% (stage 1) of
    the total canopy cover of each stage. A total of 18 species were selected for
    leaf sampling. All leaf material was collected over a two-month period between
    late March and early May 2012, near the end of the dry summer season. There were
    no significant rain events during this period. In each of the 50 plots, only healthy
    mature individuals were selected for sampling. In general, mature and senesced
    leaves were sampled from one individual plant per species in each plot. A species
    was considered absent from a plot if it could not be found within ~30 m of its
    centre. The number of individual collections (one collection = both mature and
    senesced leaves) per species in each chronosequence stage ranged from five to
    ten.'

  methods: These data were collected by Osmarina Alves Marinho between September and
    November 2012 as part of her Honours project. Charles Price helped with leaf area
    measurements. Mature, fully expanded and sunlight-exposed leaves were collected
    in the field by cutting entire shoots. Shoots were kept hydrated until leaves
    were scanned. Software was used to measured leaf area. Leaves were weighed fresh
    and dry to calculate leaf dry matter content. Replicates for each measurement

    PhD research.

  replicates: 5-10
  methods: The number of individual collections (one collection = both mature and
    senesced leaves) per species in each chronosequence stage ranged from five to
    ten. In each case, representative samples of mature and senesced leaves were collected
    using nitrile gloves in order to minimise sample contamination. Leaves were not
    washed prior to nutrient analyses but we consider dust contamination to be highly
    unlikely, given the sandy nature of the soils. Mature leaves were undamaged, fully
    expanded and exposed to full sunlight. In most cases, senesced leaves were collected
    directly from the plant by gently shaking the plant and collecting fallen leaves.
    Senesced leaves were easily distinguished from green leaves, since they were yellow
    or brown and detached easily from the plant. However, for a few species it was
    not possible to collect senesced leaves from live plants, in which case senesced
    leaves were collected directly beneath the plant from recently fallen litter.
    In all cases, there was no visible degradation of senesced leaves collected from
    this litter, which had predominantly fallen during the summer and had not been
    exposed to any significant rain between litter fall and collection. Therefore,
    we assumed that losses of nutrients through leaching or decomposition were minimal,
    although some photodegradation may have occurred. A total of 508 leaf samples
    (mature and senesced) were collected for nutrient analyses. Each leaf sample was
    oven-dried (70 _C, 48 h) and finely ground using a Teflon-coated stainless steel
    ball mill. A subsample was analysed for carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) concentrations
    using a continuous-flow system consisting of a SERCON 20-22 mass spectrometer
    connected with an automated nitrogen/carbon analyser (Sercon, Crewe, UK). Stable
    isotopes of C and N were analysed using a continuous flow system consisting of
    a SERCON 20-22 mass spectrometer connected with an automated N/C analyser (Sercon,
    Crewe, UK). These analyses were done at the Western Australian Biogeochemistry
    Centre, located at the University of Western Australia. A second subsample was
    acid-digested using concentrated HNO3:HClO4 (3:1) and analysed for Ca, Cd, Cu,
    Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Mo, Na, P, S and Zn concentrations using inductively coupled plasmaatomic
    emission spectrometry (ICP-AES; ChemCentre, Perth, Australia). All digests were
    first analysed using a simultaneous Varian Vista Pro (Australia), radially configured
    ICP-AES equipment fitted with a charge-coupled device (CCD) detection system and
    an A.I. Scientific AIM-3600 auto-sampler. Samples with P concentrations close
    to minimum reporting limit were re-run on more sensitive axially-configured ICP-AES
    equipment. The ICP analyses were done at the WA Chemcentre.

    using nitrile gloves in order to minimise sample contamination. Leaves were not
    washed prior to nutrient analyses but we consider dust contamination to be highly
    unlikely, given the sandy nature of the soils. Mature leaves were undamaged, fully
    expanded and exposed to full sunlight. In most cases, senesced leaves were collected
    directly from the plant by gently shaking the plant and collecting fallen leaves.
    Senesced leaves were easily distinguished from green leaves, since they were yellow
    or brown and detached easily from the plant. However, for a few species it was
    not possible to collect senesced leaves from live plants, in which case senesced
    leaves were collected directly beneath the plant from recently fallen litter.
    In all cases, there was no visible degradation of senesced leaves collected from
    this litter, which had predominantly fallen during the summer and had not been
    exposed to any significant rain between litter fall and collection. Therefore,
    we assumed that losses of nutrients through leaching or decomposition were minimal,
    although some photodegradation may have occurred. A total of 508 leaf samples
    (mature and senesced) were collected for nutrient analyses. Each leaf sample was
    oven-dried (70 _C, 48 h) and finely ground using a Teflon-coated stainless steel
    ball mill. A subsample was analysed for carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) concentrations
    using a continuous-flow system consisting of a SERCON 20-22 mass spectrometer
    connected with an automated nitrogen/carbon analyser (Sercon, Crewe, UK). Stable
    isotopes of C and N were analysed using a continuous flow system consisting of
    a SERCON 20-22 mass spectrometer connected with an automated N/C analyser (Sercon,
    Crewe, UK). These analyses were done at the Western Australian Biogeochemistry
    Centre, located at the University of Western Australia. A second subsample was
    acid-digested using concentrated HNO3:HClO4 (3:1) and analysed for Ca, Cd, Cu,
    Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Mo, Na, P, S and Zn concentrations using inductively coupled plasmaatomic
    emission spectrometry (ICP-AES; ChemCentre, Perth, Australia). All digests were
    first analysed using a simultaneous Varian Vista Pro (Australia), radially configured
    ICP-AES equipment fitted with a charge-coupled device (CCD) detection system and
    an A.I. Scientific AIM-3600 auto-sampler. Samples with P concentrations close
    to minimum reporting limit were re-run on more sensitive axially-configured ICP-AES
    equipment. The ICP analyses were done at the WA Chemcentre.
