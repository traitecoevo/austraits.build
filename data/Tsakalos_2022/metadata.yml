  description: Dataset studying clonality-environment links in underexplored Western
    Australian shrublands to deepen our understanding of the role played by this essential
    strategy in open ecosystems globally.
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: The study area, 1210 km2 in area, is found on Iluka Resource's
    Ltd Pty mining tenement located around the township of Eneabba (29°49'S, 115°16'E),
    ~280 km north of Perth, Western Australia. The study area consists of sandy plains
    (~85 % of the study area), laterite-capped hillocks (~10 %) and minor drainage
    lines (~5 %) (Playford et al., 1976; Mory, 1994). Based on species co-occurrence
    patterns, the vegetation has been classified into two major community groups (sandy
    and clayey shrubland), with a soil texture and coupled exchangeable cation gradients
    (Tsakalos et al., 2018). The sandy shrubland is widespread and occurs on sandy
    soils with low exchangeable cations, while the clayey shrubland is more spatially
    constrained (wet depressions) and is typical of clay-enriched or clayey soils
    with higher exchangeable cation content. The sandy shrubland is species-rich and
    includes diagnostic species such as Alexgeorgea nitens (Restionaceae), Banksia
    attenuata (Proteaceae), Callitris acuminata (Cupressaceae) and Verticordia grandis
    (Myrtaceae). The clayey shrubland has a lower species richness and includes diagnostic
    species such as Melaleuca concreta, M. urceolaris, Thryptomene mucronulata (all
    Myrtaceae) and Conostylis prolifera (Haemodoraceae). Classification of a species-trait
    data set featuring response traits linked to water relationships, carbon balance,
    nutrition acquisition and fire response revealed two functional communities also
    distributed along with the previously identified sand-clay soil texture and coupled
    exchangeable cation gradient (Tsakalos et al., 2019). ^p Data collection and collation
    ^p We use species compositional, soil and trait data sets featured in Tsakalos
    et al. (2018, 2019, 2020). The plot data collation details are given in Tsakalos
    et al. (2018). The availability of soil data sampled and analysed at the plot
    level (n = 189; each of 100 m2 in size) served as the limiting factor in selecting
    and constructing balanced compositional and trait data sets. A preliminary inspection
    of the soil and compositional properties led to the removal of 51 marginal plots.
    These were considered disturbed - proximal to paddocks and containing edaphic
    variables deviating from those expected in natural systems (such as P > 50 mg
    kg-1, Singh and Gilkes, 1991; bulk density < 1.1,Bache et al., 2008) and containing
    species associated with younger dune systems linked to exposed limestone. We used
    138 plots positioned in the sandy (119) and clayey (19) shrubland communities
    for all further analyses. We used soil data on bulk density (g cm-3; proxy for
    water availability, with an inverse relationship), total N (%; N) and total P
    (mg kg-1; P), which captured a spatially representative subset of the survey area
    to form our environmental data set (for soil sampling and chemical extraction
    details, refer to Tsakalos et al., 2018). ^p We created a CGO database by scoring
    six (one main organ type per species) nominal CGO trait categories (i.e. lignotubers,
    herbaceous and woody rhizomes, stolons, tubers, stem fragments) and recognizing
    the absence of clonality (i.e. nonclonal) as an additional category, for all 463
    species present within the 138 plots (Supplementary Data Table S1).

    stolons, tubers, stem fragments) and recognizing the absence of clonality (i.e.
    nonclonal) as an additional category, for all 463 species present within the 138
    plots (Supplementary Data Table S1). Clonality is the potential capacity to produce
    multiple rooting units (ramets), which may become independent when the connection
    with the parent plant is lost. We combined new field observations (i.e. ~25 %
    of the 463 species) made during the peak (spring) flowering season of 2019 and
    2020 with our DRYAD database (Tsakalos et al., 2020) and information from the
    FloraBase database (Western Australian Herbarium, 1998-) to establish the presence
    or absence of clonal traits. When we used the FloraBase database, we assigned
    trait values using information from specimens near the study area. With a few
    exceptions, the applied classification system of CGOs followed the concepts and
    nomenclature of standard protocols (Klimešová et al., 2019). Our rhizomatous traits
    differed in two ways. First, we did not distinguish where their growth originated
    (i.e. aboveor belowground) because we did not have such information. Second, we
    have distinguished CGO classes for herbaceous and woody rhizomes because of the
    differences in their longevity and ability to produce vertical stems (Pausas et
    al., 2018). Our tuber CGO is a large category and encompasses Klimešová et al.'s
    (2019) tubers and bulbs and includes a combination of (herbaceous) stem tubers,
    root tubers and bulbs. Lastly, we have classified lignotubers (including xylopodium;
    see Pausas et al., 2018) as a CGO because lignotubers have the potential to become
    independent rooting units (ramets), as observed in several Banksia species (Proteaceae;
    see also Millar et al., 2010) in our study area. A selection of CGOs is presented
    in Fig. 1, and a description of their general morphological characteristics and
    ecological relevance is given in Table 1.
