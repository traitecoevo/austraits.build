  description: Daily and seasonal patterns of transpiration were measured in evergreen
    eucalypt trees growing at a wet (Darwin), intermediate (Katherine) and dry site
    (Newcastle Waters) along a steep rainfall gradient in a north Australian savanna.
    Relationships between tree size and tree water use were also determined.
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: Measurements were made at three sites along the North Australian
    Tropical Transect (NATT). Instruments were installed on five trees each of the
    two dominant eucalypt species at each location for 5 days at the end of the dry
    and wet seasons.

  Darwin:
    latitude (deg): -12.5
    longitude (deg): 130.75

      open forests. Mean tree height was approximately 15 m and basal area was 8-10
      m2 ha-1. The understory is characterized by scattered small trees and shrubs
      with a seasonal grass component dominated by Sorghum spp. Rainfall is highly
      seasonal and occurs between November and April.
    precipitation (MAP): 1700
  Katherine:
    latitude (deg): -14.67
    longitude (deg): 132.65
    description: Vegetation at the Katherine site, approximately 360 km south of Darwin,
      was dominated by E. latifolia F. Muell and E. tetrodonta open forests. Mean
      canopy height was approximately 12 m and basal area was approximately 7.5 m2
      ha-1. Leaf area index of the canopy increased from 0.4 at the end of the dry
      season to 0.75 at the end of the wet season (A.P. O'Grady, unpublished data).
      Sorghum spp. dominated the understory, and understory shrubs were sparse.
    precipitation (MAP): 900
  Newcastle Waters:
    latitude (deg): -17.12
    longitude (deg): 133.77
    description: Vegetation at the Newcastle Waters site, approximately 750 km south
      of Darwin, was dominated by low open woodland of E. terminalis F. Muell and
      other Eucalyptus species. Mean canopy height was < 10 m and basal area was approximately
      4.5 m2 ha-1. Leaf area index of the canopy was low, about 0.07, with little
      change between the wet and dry seasons (R.J. Williams, CSIRO, Darwin, unpublished
      data). The understory at the site was dominated by Acacia shrubs to a height
      of about 2 m.

  methods: Tree water use was determined by the heat pulse technique with commercial
    sap-flow sensors (Greenspan Technology Pty. Ltd., Warwick, Australia). Estimates
    of heat pulse velocity were scaled to tree water use by the weighted averages
    technique of Hatton et al. (1990). Areas of conducting wood and bark thickness
    were determined from cores taken from the trees; sapwood was distinguished from
    heartwood by a distinct color change. The wood cores were used for determinations
    of volumetric wood and water fractions and a wound width of 3.1 mm was used to
    correct velocity estimates (O'Grady 2000). Instruments were installed on five
    trees each of the two dominant eucalypt species at each location for 5 days at
    the end of the dry (August-September 1998) and wet (March-April 1999) seasons.  Sap
    velocity was recorded at 15-min intervals and daily profiles were integrated to
    estimate daily tree water use.

  methods: Leaf water potential was measured between 0630 and 0700 h on two randomly

    Measurements were made with a Scholander type pressure chamber (Soil Moisture
    Corp., Santa Barbara, CA).
