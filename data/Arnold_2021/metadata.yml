  description: A study that developed and tested a high-throughput method for measuring
    the critical temperatures for PSII at low (CTMIN) and high (CTMAX) temperatures
    using a Maxi-Imaging fluorimeter and a thermoelectric Peltier plate heating/cooling
    system, in order to better assess plant thermal tolerance.
  basis_of_record: lab
  life_stage: seedling
  sampling_strategy: Species description and leaf samples ^p We chose plant species
    that represented diverse growth habits and leaf morphology (in surface characteristics
    and leaf thickness) to make simple interspecific comparisons while testing the
    T-F0 method. Wahlenbergia ceracea Lothian (Campanulaceae) (waxy bluebell) is a
    small perennial herb that is sparsely distributed across south-eastern Australia.
    We grew F2 generation W. ceracea plants under controlled glasshouse conditions
    (20°C/15°C set day/night temperatures) and leaves from mature plants were used
    for all experiments. Seed stock originated from Kosciuszko National Park, NSW,
    Australia (36.432°S, 148.338°E) that was collected in 2015 and 2016. Melaleuca
    citrina (Curtis) Dum. Cours. (Myrtaceae) (common red bottlebrush) were used for
    all experiments. This species is native to south-eastern Australia but also distributed
    as a cosmopolitan plant. Sampled individuals were growing as native shrubs at
    The Australian National University, ACT, Australia (35.279°S, 149.118°E). Quercus
    phellos L. (Fagaceae) (willow oak trees) were used only in the heat tolerance
    component of the surface wetness experiment, before the abscission of leaves in
    autumn. This deciduous species is native to North America and sampled individuals
    were growing as tall, shady ornamental trees at The Australian National University,
    ACT, Australia (35.277°S, 149.115°E). Escallonia rubra var. 'pink pixie' (Ruiz
    and Pav.) Pers. (Escalloniaceae) (pink escallonia) were used for the cold tolerance
    component of the surface wetness experiment and the heating/cooling rate experiment
    in place of Q. phellos after the former shed its leaves. E. rubra is native to
    South America and sampled individuals were growing as dense ornamental shrubs
    at The Australian National University, ACT, Australia (35.277°S, 149.117°E). ^p
    All measurements were taken between February and October 2019. Due to the variation
    in species availability across experiments and the potential effects of seasonal
    change on absolute tolerance values, we consider each experiment separately and
    do not draw comparisons across surface wetness and heating/cooling rate experiments.
    Assays (surface wetness or heating/cooling rates for heat or cold tolerance assays)
    were conducted on replicate days to control for potential effects of day. Leaves
    selected for measurement were fully expanded, visually free of damage and discolouration,
    and within two leaf pairs of a growing stem tip on an intact and healthy stem.
    Although leaf age could not be determined directly, these criteria allowed us
    to select leaves from the same cohort and of similar condition. Leaves were excised
    between 0900 hours and 1300 hours, placed in sealed bags, and then taken to the
    laboratory in an insulated container, where they were always used for T-F0 measurements
    within 30 min of initial collection. ^p Temperature-dependent change in chlorophyll
    fluorescence (T-F0) measurement ^p Leaf samples were attached to white filter
    paper (125 x 100 mm) with double-sided tape. We placed the filter paper with leaves
    on a Peltier plate (CP-121HT; TE-Technology, Inc., Michigan, USA; 152 x 152 mm
    surface) that was controlled by a bi-polar proportional-integral-derivative temperature
    controller (TC-36-25; TE-Technology, Inc.) and powered by a fixed-voltage power
    supply (PS-24-13; TE-Technology, Inc.). The Peltier plate uses four direct-contact
    thermoelectric modules that can both cool and heat the plate, which with a MP-3193
    thermistor (TE-Technology, Inc.) the plate had potential thermal limits of -20°C
    and 100°C. LabVIEW-based control software (National Instruments, Texas, USA) was
    adapted to control heating or cooling rate using source code available from TE-Technology,
    Inc. based on the supplied user interface. The Peltier plate maintained a stable
    set temperature within ± 0.1°C (precision) and ± 1°C tolerance across the plate
    surface. We attached two type-T thermocouples to the underside of two randomly
    selected leaves on the plate as representative measures of leaf temperatures.
    Thermocouple temperature data were recorded every 10 s by a dual-channel data
    logger (EL-GFX-DTC; Lascar Electronics Ltd, Salisbury, UK) and the mean temperature
    of the two thermocouples was used for all leaf temperature calculations. Because
    the two thermocouples measured temperatures of two single leaves per experimental
    run, we were able to extract a small subset of ice nucleation temperatures (NT)
    using the temperature of the first exothermic reaction in cold tolerance assays.
    The Peltier plate assembly height was controlled by a laboratory scissor-jack
    to fit within an aluminium frame at an ideal height below the fluorescence camera
    (Fig. 1a). Heavy double-glazed glass was placed on top of the leaf samples on
    the plate to compress samples against the plate surface to ensure maximum contact
    and create a thermal buffer to ensure close matching of leaf and plate temperatures.
    In addition to greater thermal buffering relative to standard glass, double-glazed
    glass avoids condensation that might lead to erroneous measurements of F0. All
    areas of both the Peltier plate and glass that were outside of the filter paper
    area were blacked out with heat-resistant black electrical tape to remove ambient
    light reflection and interference. ^Surface wetness experiment, effect of wet
    vs dry surfaces for leaves on CTMIN and CTMAX ^ Most experiments that measure
    T-F0 have measured leaf samples with all excess surface moisture removed, on a
    dry surface. However, maintaining water content of detached leaves by providing
    a wet surface where leaves were placed on top could be a viable way to facilitate
    water uptake and keep leaf samples hydrated. In our experiment, leaves were placed
    on a filter paper surface. For the wet surface treatment, leaves were placed as
    described above and then the filter paper was saturated with MilliQ water-soaked
    paper towels with excess water absorbed with dry paper towel thereafter. We compared
    T-F0 curves and Tcrit estimates for both heat and cold tolerance assays at a heating/cooling
    rate of 60°C h-1 where leaves were placed on top of either wet or dry filter paper
    surfaces. A small subset of leaves on wet and dry surfaces were also measured
    for CTMIN and NT at 15°C h-1 in addition to the 60°C h-1 experiment. ^p Heating/cooling
    rate experiment, effect of heating/cooling rate on CTMAX and CTMIN ^p Studies
    on thermal tolerance limits vary substantially in their set heating/cooling rate
    (see Table S1), ranging from 30°C h-1 to >600°C h-1 in studies on heat tolerance
    limits (CTMAX) and from 1°C h-1 to 10°C h-1 in studies on cold or freezing tolerance
    limits (CTMIN). The difference in magnitude between heat and cold tolerance limits
    reflects differences in natural potential rates of heating and cooling, where
    leaves may rapidly increase in temperature (>240°C h-1 for a short period (Vogel
    2009)) but cooling occurs far more slowly (rarely exceeding 5°C h-1 (Buchner and
    Neuner 2009). It stands to reason that the more than 10-fold difference in heating
    or cooling rates used among studies would affect the estimates and thus comparability
    of Tcrit, but this effect is not well understood. We chose a wide range of heating/cooling
    rates for both hot and cold with the aim to determine how the Tcrit estimate for
    CTMIN and CTMAX changes with heating/cooling rate. We compared T-F0 curves and
    Tcrit estimates from different heating/cooling rates for both heat (6, 15, 30,
    45, 60, 120, 240°C h-1) and cold (3, 6, 15, 30, 60, 240°C h-1) tolerance assays
    where the filter paper was dry, and measurements were conducted in darkness. For
    240, 60, and 30°C h-1 heating/cooling rates, F0 was recorded at 10 s intervals,
    20 s for 15 and 6°C h-1 heating/cooling rates, and 30 s for 3°C h-1 heating/cooling
    rates due to the 1000 record limit after which the Maxi-Imaging-PAM software stops
    recording.

  methods: We used a Pulse Amplitude Modulated (PAM) chlorophyll fluorescence imaging
    system (Maxi-Imaging-PAM; Heinz Walz GmbH, Effeltrich, Germany) mounted 185 mm
    above the Peltier plate (imaging area of ~120 x 90 mm) to measure fluorescence
    parameters. A weak blue pulse modulated measuring light (0.5 umol photons m-2
    s-1) was applied continuously at low frequency (1 Hz) to measure basal chlorophyll
    fluorescence (F0) from the LHCII without driving PSII photochemistry. A red Perspex
    hood filtered ambient light from the samples and the camera, and the entire Maxi-Imaging-PAM
    assembly was covered by thick black fabric so that all measurements were made
    in darkness. Leaves were dark adapted for 30 min to oxidise all PSII acceptors
    and obtain the basal F0 values and then a single saturating pulse at 10 000 umol
    photons m-2 s-1 was applied for 720 ms to determine the maximal fluorescence (FM)
    when the photosystem reaction centres are closed. Variable fluorescence (FV) was
    calculated as FM - F0 and the relative maximum quantum yield of PSII photochemistry
    (FV/FM) was derived. FV/FM is frequently used as a rapid measurement of stress
    or relative health of leaves, where optimal FV/FM values of non-stressed leaves
    are around 0.83 (Baker 2008; Murchie and Lawson 2013). Because our intention was
    to compare methods, we aimed for a uniform sample of leaves, and we therefore
    used FV/FM values >0.65 to subset data to exclude any damaged leaves and focus
    on the T-F0 of only healthy leaves. This conservative sample exclusion process
    resulted in some experimental conditions or species with uneven and lower sample
    sizes. ^p In each assay, we selected circular areas of interest that were as large
    as could fit within the boundaries of each leaf using the Maxi-Imaging-PAM software,
    such that the F0 values were measured on the widest part of each leaf. One minute
    after measuring FV/FM, the heating/cooling program was started simultaneously
    with the continuous recording of F0 values at set intervals with specifics varying
    depending on duration of the assay reflecting memory capacity limits of the Maxi-Imaging-PAM
    (see below). For hot T-F0 measurements, the initial set temperature held for dark
    adaptation of the leaves and FV/FM was 20°C, which was then heated to 60°C at
    varying rates (see heating/cooling rate experiment). For cold T-F0 measurements,
    the assays were conducted in a cold room (set temperature, 4°C ± 2°C) so that
    the Peltier plate could reach -20°C. At ambient room temperatures of ~20-22°C,
    the Peltier plate can reach approximately -14°C before the plate heat output restrains
    cooling capacity. The initial set temperature held for dark adaptation of the
    leaves and FV/FM was 4°C, which was then cooled down to -20°C.

    produced by heating/cooling the Peltier plate (and leaf samples) is characterised
    by a stable or slow-rise in F0 values until a critical temperature threshold where
    there is a fast rise in F0. With temperature on the x-axis and F0 on the y-axis,
    the inflection point of extrapolated regression lines for each of the slow and
    fast rise phases of the temperature-dependent chlorophyll fluorescence response
    is the critical temperature, Tcrit (Knight and Ackerly 2002; Neuner and Pramsohler
    2006). The term Tcrit is ambiguous outside of this context when both hot and cold
    thermal tolerance assays are conducted within the same study. Hereafter, we refer
    to Tcrit only as the temperature extrapolated at the inflection point, and elsewhere
    use accepted nomenclature used in thermal biology, CTMAX and CTMIN, as upper (heat)
    and lower (cold) thermal limits of leaf thermal tolerance (e.g. Sinclair et al.
    2016; Janion-Scheepers et al. 2018). Fig. 1 presents representative T-F0 curves
    and the calculations of Tcrit values for freezing leaves, where the fast rise
    phase occurs abruptly (Fig. 1b), and for heating leaves where the fast rise phase
    is relatively gradual (Fig. 1c). The inflection point was calculated using a break-point
    regression analysis of the mean leaf temperature estimated from two thermocouples
    attached to leaves on the plate and relative F0 values using the segmented R package
    (Muggeo 2017) using the R Environment for Statistical Computing (R Core Team 2020).
    We provide example files and example R code for extracting Tcrit values from T-F0
    curves at https://github.com/pieterarnold/Tcrit-extraction.
