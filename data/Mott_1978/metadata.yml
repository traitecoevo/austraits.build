  description: A study of the dormancy and germination requirements of five native grass species (Themeda australis, Chrysopogon fallax, C. latifolius, Sorghum plumosum, S. stipoideum) from the savannah woodlands of the Northern Territory under controlled conditions.

  sampling_strategy: Field Germination ^p A field experiment was carried out near Katherine in eucalypt woodland, with a grass understorey dominated by Themeda australis, on heavy red earth soils (Aldrick and Robinson 1972). Fifteen 1-m square quadrats were set up in November 1972 on a 10 ha block of grassland that had been burnt in September 1972. A further 15 quadrats were also set up on an adjacent block of T. australis-dominated grassland which had been left unburnt. At fortnightly intervals throughout the 1972-73 wet season, germination of T. australis was scored in each quadrat. Soil surface temperatures on cleared soil were measured by the use of a Grant miniature temperature recorder with small (3 x 45 mm) thermistor probes buried 2 mm below the ground surface. ^p Laboratory Germination ^p Fully mature dispersal units of the grasses were collected near Katherine during January and February in 1974 and 1975. These were stored in the dark at 25°C until the various treatments were imposed on the units. Awns were removed from all species before germination trials were commenced. Hereafter, dispersal units will be referred to as seeds. Where caryopses were used they were obtained by dissecting away the enclosing glumes. Germination trials were carried out in petri dishes either on 1 % agar or on watch glasses wrapped in filter paper and resting in liquid (Mott 1972). The liquid was either water or an aqueous solution of the chemical used in the particular test. Preliminary experiments showed no significant differences between the results obtained respectively from agar and filter paper. The seeds were routinely germinated at a constant temperature of 30°C and light intensity of 800 lx, supplied by Philips warm-white fluorescent tubes. Dark treatments were imposed by covering the dishes with aluminium foil and recording germination under weak green light. A seed or caryopsis was considered to have germinated when the radicle was more than 5 mm long. ^p To examine the effect of temperature on germination, seeds were germinated over a range of temperatures from 19 to 42°C by a thermo-gradient bar. This bar was similar to but larger than that of Halldal and French (1958), and 10 separate bottomless Perspex containers were placed along the bar. Non-dormant seeds were placed in petri dishes as for the germination tests above and then put into the containers. Thermocouple probes within the petri dishes showed that temperatures remained constant throughout the tests. ^p The effect of moisture stress on germination was examined by the use of a high molecular weight polyethylene glycol (mol. wt. 6000) to produce osmotic stress on the germinating seeds. In order to obtain an index of the relative ability of the seed of the tropical grasses to tolerate osmotic stress, Lolium perenne (perennial ryegrass) was included in the trials. As the response of this species had been detemined by McWilliam et al. (1970), trials were carried out as for standardized germination tests with the petri dishes containing polyethylene glycol solutions around the watch glasses. Solutions were changed every 48 hr to maintain osmotic potential. The seeds were tested at 30°C for the tropical grass species and at 23° for perennial ryegrass. The effect of alternate wetting and redrying of seeds on their germination characteristics was examined by setting up seeds as for standard germination tests and leaving them for 12 hr. The seeds were then removed from the incubator, blotted dry and replaced in the incubator on the filter paper. The seeds returned to their original moisture content within 8 hr but were left in the incubator for a further 40 hr. Following this treatment, the dry seeds were returned to moist filter paper for a standard germination test. ^p Dormancy Freshly harvested seed of all species was subjected to a variety of treatments in an attempt to break dormancy. The treatments were (a) dry storage under different conditions, (b) stratification, (c) removal of the enclosing glumes, (d) chemical treatments and (e) washing. ^p Three dry storage treatments were employed. In two the seed was stored in the dark, either at a constant temperature of 25°C or in an oven with a diurnal fluctuation of 20-60°. The latter temperature regime was similar to that recorded on the soil surface during May to October in the Katherine region. A third treatment involved the exposure of seed to conditions existent at the soil surface in the field. In this case, seed was placed in Nylon mesh bags and pegged to the soil surface in a cleared area. Temperature measurements carried out with thermistor probes showed that the temperatures in the mesh bags were similar to those on the soil surface. In all storage treatments, two replicates were removed every 4 weeks and their contents bulked. Standard germination tests were then carried out on subsamples of the bulked seed. ^p Stratification was carried out by leaving moist seed at 4°C for either 4 or 8 weeks and then subjecting the seed to standard germination conditions. In chemical treatments the distilled water substrate was replaced by an aqueous solution of the reagent in question (see Table 3). ^p The washing treatment employed was similar to that used by Mott (1972), with the seeds contained in a Nylon mesh bag in a glass tube. Tap water was passed through the tubes for 24 hr after which germination of the seeds was assessed. ^p In all investigations the viability of each seed lot was determined either by the tetrazolium method of Porter eta!. (1947) or by dissection of the seed at the completion of a germination test. On dissection, the seeds were classified as viable if the embryo and endosperm were still firm and intact or as dead if the caryopsis had turned pulpy and begun to decay. Germination throughout the paper has been expressed as a percentage of viable seed. In all species viability was greater than 70 %.
