  sampling_strategy: This dataset is sourced from Lucid Australian Tropical Rainforest Plants online flora. Briefly, the textual descriptions of each taxon in were downloaded and organised into a tabular format of individual taxon names and their corresponding text using R coding script. Sentences and phrases were categorised using a large glossary of botanical terminology as referring to one of the following, the entire organism, stem, leaf, flower, fruit/seed, roots and environment/habitat. Key terms corresponding to trait values in AusTraits were then extracted from these smaller chunks of text using a reference table containing a) the AusTraits trait name, b) the AusTraits trait value and c) terms to search for in the text. The resulting traits were then checked manually using a subset of ~500 taxa to search for errors and update the reference table and coding script accordingly. The process was repeated iteratively to remove any wrongly classified trait values and to ensure as many correct trait values as possible were captured using the algorithm. For some traits such as plant_growth_form and life_history, unclassified taxa were inferred as possessing a trait value from a higher-level taxonomic description e.g. all taxa in the Amyema genus were classified as stem_parasitic, which was mentioned only in the genus description. Specific to the plant_growth_form trait, any taxon without a growth form and that was described as annual, biennial or perennial was inferred as herbaceous.
