  unit_in: mm
  trait_name: seed_length
  value_type: expert_min
  replicates: .na
  methods: Measurements were taken from well pressed, herbarium specimens, taking
    care to measure the inflorescence and floral organs when they were fully mature.
    Multiple images of seeds were taken with a Nikon Digital Head (DS-5M) controlled
    by a DS Camera Control Unit (DS-L1) and a montage of the images was collated using
    the Synopics Auto-Montage Pro Version 5.03.0061 software.
