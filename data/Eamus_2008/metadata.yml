  description: 'We studied relationships among branch hydraulic conductivity, xylem embolism, stomatal conductance (gs), foliar nitrogen (N) concentration and specific leaf area (SLA) of seven tree species growing at four temperate woodland sites
    spanning a 464–1350 mm rainfall gradient. Specifically, we examined the question: are gs and foliar N concentration coordinated with branch hydraulic conductivity and, if so, what are the implications for carbon assimilation?'
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: We measured area-based, light-saturated photosynthetic rate (Aa), gs, leaf N concentration, SLA, hydraulic architecture and branch structural traits at four woodland sites differing in mean annual rainfall. At each site, we established a single 50 x 50 m plot within which 10 randomly selected trees were chosen for sampling. Individual trees were selected by dividing the quadrat into sub-quadrats of about 2 x 2 m, selecting 10 sub-quadrats based on a table of random numbers and choosing a single tree within each sub-quadrat. All sampling was conducted in summer, between December 2005 and February 2006. All branches and leaves sampled were free of disease and insect damage.

  methods: 'A single, sun-exposed branch was cut from the upper crown of each tree of each sub-quadrat, and the cut end immediately placed in a bottle of distilled water. A Walz HCM-1000 portable infrared gas analyzer (Walz, Effeltrich, Germany) measured Aa and gs in two young fully expanded leaves per branch within 5 min of immersing the cut end of the branch in water. All measurements were taken between 0900 and 1100 h (Australian Eastern Standard Time) at ambient CO2 concentrations and temperatures and at solar irradiances exceeding 1000 umol m– 2 s –1 photosynthetic photon flux. We validated that measurements made on excised branches did not differ from measurements made on attached branches by randomly selecting three trees of each species, choosing a single accessible sun-exposed branch from each tree and measuring Aa and gs. We then excised each branch, placed it in distilled water and measured Aa and gs at 5-min intervals for 15 min. We found no difference between Aa and gs of attached and detached branches over this time period, and neither variable declined significantly over the 15-min period (repeated measures ANOVA; insignificant time main effect; P > 0.5 for all species; data not shown). Our measurements of Aa and gs do not represent maximum rates of CO2 assimilation and gs, which are usually measured under conditions of non-limiting light, temperature and water availability. Although our measurements of Aa and gs are not temperature or light limited, soil water may have been limiting at many of the sites because the region experienced drought during the measurement period. Thus, our measurements of Aa and gs represent maximum observed rates of CO2 assimilation and gs at the time and place of sampling, not maximum rates for each species/tree examined. Atmospheric water content and leaf temperature were not controlled during the measurements, but leaves were sampled only under saturating light conditions. In some cases, individual leaves were too small to cover the entire area of the measuring cuvette. In these cases, we removed the leaf portion in the cuvette and measured its area with a Li-Cor LI-3000A leaf area meter. Photosynthetic rates were then recalculated: Aa = (Ameasured x cuvette area)/projected leaf area. Stomatal conductance was similarly recalculated. For needle-leaved Callitris trees, gas exchange rates were expressed on a needle surface area rather than on a projected area basis. We assumed that Callitris needles were cylindrical and Aa was subsequently modified to Aa = (Ameasured x cuvette area)/ 0.5(projected leaf area x Pi).'

  unit_in: ml*cm/s/MPa
  trait_name: stem_hydraulic_conductivity
  value_type: raw_value
  replicates: 1
  methods: Branch hydraulic conductivity (k; ml cm s –1 MPa –1) was measured as described by Macinnis-Ng et al. (2004). The terminal segments of branches of 3–6 mm diameter were selected from the sunlit portion of the canopy. Only current-year growth was sampled, so that the leaves on the branch were those formed during the current growing season. The branch and all leaves from each branch (at the petiole-branch junction) were excised under distilled water to prevent embolism. The basal end of each branch was recut underwater about 5 mm from the point of excision. Branches were then inserted into the lid of a custom-built vacuum chamber. The basal end of each branch was quickly connected with flexible tubing to a 1-cm3 graduated pipette filled with distilled, filtered (0.22 um) and acidified (pH 2.0 with 10% hydrochloric acid; Sperry et al. 1994) water. Hydraulic conductivity was measured by increasing the pressure in the vacuum chamber in five steps (deltaP ~ –20, –30, –40, –50 and –60 kPa). At each pressure, sap flow (ml s –1) was measured by recording the rate of change in volume of water in the pipette. Branches were allowed to equilibrate at each pressure for 10 min before measurement began. Hydraulic conductivity was calculated as the ordinary least-squares regression slope of the relationship between sap flow and deltaP/l, where l is length of the branch segment (Prior and Eamus 2000). Previous work has established that the absence of salts from the perfusion solution does not affect the value of conductivity obtained (Prior and Eamus 2000, Macinnis-Ng et al. 2004). There was no evidence that flow rates declined with time in the vacuum chamber.

There was no evidence that flow rates declined with time in the vacuum chamber. After completion of the branch hydraulic conductivity measurements, sapwood and leaf areas of each branch were measured. Sapwood area was determined by dipping thin cross sections of branch in methyl orange and measuring the diameter of the stained (heartwood) and unstained (sapwood) sections with a calibrated eyepiece micrometer. Leaf area distal to the basal end of each branch was measured with a leaf area meter (Li-Cor LI-3000A). Sapwood-specific, branch hydraulic conductivity (ks) was calculated by dividing the conductivity of a branch by its sapwood area.
