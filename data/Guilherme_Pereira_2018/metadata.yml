  description: dataset looking at nutrient allocation at a cellular level in species
    growing in P-impoverished soils in Western Australia
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: 'The study sites in Australia (Quindalup young, Quindalup old
    and Spearwood West) covered a considerable range of soil phosphorus (P) concentrations
    ([P]; 22-350 and 1.07-1.42 mg P kg -1 soil for total and resin-extractable soil
    [P], respectively). These sites were all located near Jurien Bay, Western Australia,
    c. 200 km north of Perth. Soil conditions within these areas varied from where
    plant productivity is more P-limited (Spearwood West, SW), to where it is nitrogen
    (N) and P co-limited (Quindalup old, QO), and N-limited (Quindalup young, QY;
    Laliberte et al., 2012). The SW dunes were formed in the middle to late Pleistocene
    (>120 kyr ago (ka); Kendrick et al., 1991; Laliberte et al., 2012), being extremely
    P-impoverished with no detectable carbonate (Bastian, 1996; Tapsell et al., 2003;
    Turner & Laliberte, 2015). By contrast, the Quindalup dunes are associated with
    Holocene transgressions (< 7 ka; Laliberte et al., 2012; McArthur et al., 1991),
    and have high total P and average to high carbonate concentrations (25-82%; Laliberte
    et al., 2012; McArthur et al., 1991; Turner & Laliberte, 2015). The total soil
    P and carbonate concentration of the QY dunes are significantly higher than those
    of the QO dunes (Laliberte et al., 2012; Turner & Laliberte, 2015). The three
    sampling areas were located within <20 km from each other and individual samples
    were taken from a single site (<100 m apart) at each of the study areas (QY, QO
    and SW) ^p The species were selected based on their dominance and relative importance
    in the study areas and because, together, they effectively cover a broad range
    of the eudicot phylogeny. Each study area contained a different set of species
    (Supporting Information Table S1). In Australia, eight species were selected:
    Acacia rostellifera; Anthocercis littorea; Labichea cassioides; Melaleuca systena;
    Myoporum insulare; Olearia axillaris; Spyridium globulosum and Templetonia retusa.'

  methods: (These values are also part of the Guilherme_Pereira_2019 dataset and are therefore not included here.) The photosynthetic rates were measured on mature, fully expanded, undamaged
    and sun-exposed leaves of three to eight individual plants for each species in
    November 2011 using a portable photosynthesis system (LI-6400; Li-Cor, Lincoln,
    NE, USA) equipped with an LED light source (LI-6400-02B). All of the gas-exchange
    measurements were performed at 1800 umol photons m-2 s-1 Photosynthetic Photon
    Flux Density (PPFD), with a constant [CO2] of 400 umol mol-1 air.

  methods: 'Between three and six healthy, fully mature individual plants were selected
    for each species in each of the study areas. From each individual plant, only
    mature, expanded, undamaged and sun-exposed leaves were sampled. In total, 60
    samples were collected for bulk-leaf nutrient analyses. The material was then
    oven-dried at 60 deg C for 72 h, before being ground using a ball-mill grinder.
    The samples were acid-digested using concentrated HNO3 : HClO4 (3:1) and the concentration
    of P was determined colourimetrically using the malachite green method (Motomizu
    et al., 1983). Total leaf [P] was expressed on a dry-mass basis.'

questions:
  contributor: Do you also have the cell nutrint concentrations described in the paper
    - or are these part of the Hayes study I received?
  question_2: I just want to confirm that these data have been collected independently
    of the values we have attributed to Laliberte_2012 and Hayes_2014. Based on spot
    checks of values they look like different sample measurements, but I'm not sure.
  question_3: Do you have exact lat/lon coordinates for each sample location? As a
    placeholder, I've used a lat/lon pair from one of the Laliberte plots on the same
    soil type/parent material, but they won't be precisely correct for your study.
