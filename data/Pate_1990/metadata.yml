  description: A study examining the growth and storage traits of seedlings growing
    after recent fires in fire-prone, Mediterranean-type ecosystems in south-western
    Australia.
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: seedling
  sampling_strategy: Study sites and plant species ^p Seedlings of a range of woody
    and herbaceous dicotyledonous species were collected during the period December
    1987-January 1989 from four sites which had been subjected to fire 2-4 years previously.
    (1) Coastal heath shrublands on deep calcareous or siliceous sands at Parry's
    Inlet, Denmark (34°58'S, 117°21'E). (2) Understorey of jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata)
    forest on gravelly lateritic soil at Kelmscott (32°07'S, 116°01'E). (3) Banksia
    woodlands (B. attenuata, B. menziesii, B. ilicifolia and B. prionotes) on deep
    leached sands at Yanchep (31°31'S, 115°41'E). (4) Banksia shrublands (B. hookeriana,
    B. attentuata, B. menziesii) on deep, heavily leached sands at Eneabba (29°49'S,
    115°61'E). The taxa investigated totalled 66 species, 27 seeders, 37 resprouters
    and two species initially classified as facultative seeder/resprouters. One of
    the latter (Acacia extensa) typically failed to survive fire in the habitats examined
    in this study, and so was grouped with the seeders, while the ecotype studied
    of the second species (Conospermum triplinervium) was classified for present purposes
    as a resprouter species in showing generally high resistance to fire at its study
    site. Elsewhere this species has been regarded as a seeder (Dixon, 1987). The
    species chosen included representatives of 17 families of dicotyledons, but were
    predominantly species of three species-rich families Fabaceae, Proteaceae and
    Myrtaceae.

  methods: Sampling of shoot and root biomass ^p This involved harvesting ten randomly
    selected individuals of 32 selected species. Each seedling was excavated to its
    full rooting depth, and all of the rooting catchment was progressively sieved
    and carefully examined to recover root biomass. In most cases, relatively small
    excavations were required, since root depth was less than 075 m and lateral roots
    extended only to 0-25 m radius around the main seedling root. In other large shrub
    and tree species (e.g. members of the Proteaceae in the deep sands at the Yanchep
    site) rooting depths were up to 3 m and laterals radiated up to 05 m. Extraction
    of roots then required deep access pits at an appropriate distance from the plants
    in question, followed by systematic recovery of root biomass from the pit walls.

  methods: Sampling for root anatomy and for concentrations of starch and macronutrient
    elements in shoot and root ^p Five individuals of each of the 66 species were
    excavated to 300 mm depth and separated into root and shoot biomass. All harvests
    were taken in November or December. Transverse sections of root of 5 mm thickness
    were cut from the middle of the principal (tap) root of each seedling and immediately
    fixed in 5% glutaraldehyde (in buffered 01 M phosphate, pH 70) to await embedding
    and sectioning. The shoot and remaining root material were dried at 90 °C in a
    forceddraught oven, weighed and then finely ground (01 -mm mesh) in preparation
    for mineral and starch analysis. ^p Starch analyses. Concentrations of starch
    in shoots and roots of all study species were determined by extracting Ol-g aliquots
    of dry matter in perchloric acid and precipitating the solubilized starch with
    iodine (Pucher, Leavenworth, and Vickery, 1948). The starch was then redissolved
    in dilute perchloric acid and assayed by the phenol method (Dubois et al., 1956).
    Each determination involved at least two replicate assays, and each batch of determinations
    was calibrated against a new set of starch standards.

    cut transversely at 2-fim thickness. Sections were treated with periodic acid-Schiffs
    reagent, counterstained with Toluidine Blue O (pH 4-6), and then examined and
    photographed using a Zeiss light microscope. Sections from roots of each species
    were examined to determine where, and at what packing density (a visually-based
    score of 0-10), starch grains were present. Proportional areas of root comprised
    of cortex, rays and xylem parenchyma (between rays) were assessed from photomicrographs
    of the sections.
