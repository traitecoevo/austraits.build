  description: A study examining the growth and storage traits of seedlings growing
    after recent fires in fire-prone, Mediterranean-type ecosystems in south-western
    Australia.
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: seedling
  sampling_strategy: Study sites and plant species ^p Seedlings of a range of woody
    and herbaceous dicotyledonous species were collected during the period December
    1987-January 1989 from four sites which had been subjected to fire 2-4 years previously.
    (1) Coastal heath shrublands on deep calcareous or siliceous sands at Parry's
    Inlet, Denmark (34°58'S, 117°21'E). (2) Understorey of jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata)
    forest on gravelly lateritic soil at Kelmscott (32°07'S, 116°01'E). (3) Banksia
    woodlands (B. attenuata, B. menziesii, B. ilicifolia and B. prionotes) on deep
    leached sands at Yanchep (31°31'S, 115°41'E). (4) Banksia shrublands (B. hookeriana,
    B. attentuata, B. menziesii) on deep, heavily leached sands at Eneabba (29°49'S,
    115°61'E). The taxa investigated totalled 66 species, 27 seeders, 37 resprouters
    and two species initially classified as facultative seeder/resprouters. One of
    the latter (Acacia extensa) typically failed to survive fire in the habitats examined
    in this study, and so was grouped with the seeders, while the ecotype studied
    of the second species (Conospermum triplinervium) was classified for present purposes
    as a resprouter species in showing generally high resistance to fire at its study
    site. Elsewhere this species has been regarded as a seeder (Dixon, 1987). The
    species chosen included representatives of 17 families of dicotyledons, but were
    predominantly species of three species-rich families Fabaceae, Proteaceae and
    Myrtaceae.
