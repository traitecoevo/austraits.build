  description: Study investigating how grasses species differed in their post-fire
    resprouting response as a result of drought treatments.
  collection_type: glasshouse
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: 'We selected 37 genera and 52 species, comprising 34 C3 and 18
    C4 perennial species, spanning 13 grass tribes (Soreng et al., 2017) that inhabit
    temperate grassland, woodland and forest habitats of southern Australia (Table
    1). This region is characterised by predominately winter_spring rainfall and summer_autumn
    fire activity (Murphy et al., 2013). It supports 64 genera of grasses, and c.
    400 species, across a broad precipitation gradient (350-1000 mm) and a variety
    of fire regimes (Bradstock, 2010; Murphy et al., 2013). Most genera (34) used
    in this experiment were represented by one species per genera. Three genera (Austrostipa,
    Poa, Rytidosperma) were represented by two, two and 14 species, respectively.
    Plants were grown in 6 l pots using a standard native grass potting media for
    6 months before treatments being applied. There were three drought treatments,
    with five blocks per treatment and one replicate of each species per block (n
    = 5 per treatment). Pots were arranged within a well-lit, temperature-controlled
    glasshouse (maximum daytime temperatures were 25 deg C, while minimum overnight
    temperatures ranged from 10-23 deg C). To reduce within-block shading of grasses,
    whole blocks were randomly shifted every 2 wk, with random re-arrangement within
    blocks. Drought treatment To test the effects of drought on fire response of grasses,
    we imposed three levels of drought for 35 d before burning. The drought treatments
    were based on watering frequency: (1) ''Control'' (plants watered to field capacity
    every 4 d); (2) ''Moderate Drought'' (plants watered to field capacity every 8
    d); and (3) ''Severe Drought'' (plants watered to field capacity every 11 d).
    On average, based on weight of moisture loss from field capacity to the time of
    next watering, the treatments depleted soil moisture by 14.6 +/- 0.9% (mean +/-
    1SE; Control), 19 +/-1% (Moderate Drought) and 40.7 +/- 1.1% (Severe Drought).
    Fire treatment All plants in the three drought treatments were burned in situ
    (within pots) using 4 mm concrete sheeting to prevent heat damage to plastic pots.
    Plants were burned at the end of a treatment drought cycle. Because of the differing
    drought treatments imposed, plants in each treatment were not fully cured at the
    time of burning; 11-d droughted plants typically had drier canopies than 4-d droughted
    plants (N. Moore, pers. obs.). As grasses retained different amounts of moisture
    and cured differently across treatments, they were unlikely to burn completely
    when ignited. Indeed, we observed that 11-d droughted plants typically had more
    flammable canopies than 4-d droughted plants. Hence, we tried to minimise heterogeneity
    of burns by using a hand-held gas torch to apply flames to each plant, with temperatures
    in the flaming zone ranging between 300-700 deg C. This ensured all plants had
    c. 100% leaf scorch and experienced a temperature range (measured near the ground)
    that is common in southern Australia tussock grassland fires (Morgan, 1999). Most
    plants took c. 10-15 s to combust. This approach eliminates inherent differences
    in flammability caused by factors such as biomass quantity, density and moisture
    content which effect ignitability, sustainability and combustibility (Simpson
    et al., 2016). After burning, plants were returned to the glasshouse and remained
    unwatered for 2 d. All treatment blocks were then returned to a 4-d watering cycle
    for a further 10 wk. Whole blocks were randomly shifted every 2 wk during this
    period, including random re-arrangement within blocks. After 10 wk, plant survival
    and the number of post-fire tillers per plant were recorded.'
