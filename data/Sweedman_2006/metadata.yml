  description: Collation of seed germination times from Kings Park and Botanic Garden
    (Western Australia) since 1962.
  basis_of_record: lab
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: Records of seed germination times have been kept at Kings Park
    and Botanic Garden since 1962 after the Gardens initiated a Programme to propagate
    native species required for living collections. The first two decades of germination
    records were published in booklet form in 1980 and proved to be a very popular
    source of information for nurseries and enthusiasts alike. The booklet provided
    practical information about the expected germination time for more than 2000 species
    of Australian native plants. ^p The records in this appendix have been compiled
    from more than 40 years of data collection. This information should enable growers
    and enthusiasts to plan their propagation and nursery operations and not waste
    time and space waiting for seeds that will not germinate. The data provided in
    this appendix relate to the length of time for shortest, longest and mean time
    to germinate for over 2200 species of Australian native plants, together with
    the number of samples for which germination was recorded. If there was no germination
    then the sample has been excluded.

  methods: The data provided in this appendix relate to the length of time for shortest,
    longest and mean time to germinate for over 2200 species of Australian native
    plants, together with the number of samples for which germination was recorded.
    If there was no germination then the sample has been excluded. ^p As many of the
    pre-treatments, especially the smoke applications, are fairly recent, the germination
    times reflect a mixture of germination with and without the pre-treatment. ^p
    No indication of success or otherwise of the germination has been provided as
    there are too many variable factors relating to germination success in the seed
    quality, collection, treatment and nursery environment, to provide any reliable
    indicator. ^p For each species, the data is arranged in columns as follows, ^p
    M Mean time to germinate. This column records the mean number of days from sowing
    to first emergence of the seedling. Q Quickest time to germinate. The minimum
    period in days from sowing to first emergence of the seedling. L Longest time
    to germinate. The maximum period in days from sowing to first emergence of the
    seedling. Times sown. The number of samples for a particular species for which
    germination was recorded. Samples for which there was no germination at all have
    been excluded. ^p R Recommended pre-treatment. Details of the recommended pre-treatment
    are provided below. If there is no pre-treatment code, then a reliable treatment
    is currently unknown. ^p Reliability of the data ^p These records have been compiled
    from data collected over many years from seed sown in a wide variety of conditions
    and times of year, and using mainly seed collected in the wild. They are intended
    as a guide to germination times only and are not definitive, as there are too
    many variables in the factors that impact on the germination. In particular, for
    many years the only pretreatment with a recognised, reliable effect was hot water
    and it was not possible to artificially break the dormancy of many seeds. Thus,
    the longer germination times of many species may be due to the time required for
    a natural break in dormancy. At one time it was normal procedure to leave some
    seeds for over 18 months after sowing so that exposure to summer temperatures
    and then winter rains and cooler temperatures would assist with dormancy breaking.
    The use of the recommended pre-treatments has helped to break seed dormancy and
    provide more reliable germination times and simultaneous germination.
