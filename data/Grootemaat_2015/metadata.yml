  description: The aim of this study was twofold, (i) to determine which morphological
    and chemical leaf traits drive flammability and (ii) to determine whether different
    (combinations of) morphological and chemical leaf traits drive interspecific variation
    in decomposition and litter flammability and, in turn, help us understand the
    relationship between decomposability and flammability.

  sampling_strategy: SITE AND SPECIES SELECTION The leaves for this study were collected
    from four sites in New South Wales, Australia. The leaf traits related to species'
    carbon and nutrient economies are well documented for these sites (Wright, Reich
    & Westoby 2001; Wright & Westoby 2002, 2003), and a detailed description of the
    sites can be found in Wright, Reich & Westoby (2001). In summary, two vegetation
    types on nutrient-rich and nutrient-poor soils were sampled, in each of two rainfall
    zones. The wetter sites were located in Kuring-Gai Chase National Park, Sydney,
    with an average annual rainfall of 1220 mm. The drier sites were located in Round
    Hill Nature Reserve, some 580 km inland, with an average annual rainfall of 387
    mm. The use of these four different sites expanded our range of plant traits without
    actually focussing on the patterns due to rainfall or site nutrient concentrations.
    The same sites were used for the litter collection for a common garden decomposition
    experiment by Cornwell (2006). By using the same sites and leaves for a subset
    of 32 species from the 51 species used in that experiment, we had the unique opportunity
    to investigate interactions between leaf traits, decomposability and flammability.
    For our experimental burns, we chose the more abundant species that also had a
    minimum leaf size of 1.0 cm2, which is about the minimum size to obtain meaningful
    flammability data when leaves are burned individually (see below). These 32 species
    (Table S2, Supporting information) were all evergreen perennials, representing
    14 different families of distant lineages. The set consisted of species with a
    variety of growth forms (trees, shrubs, one cycad and one grass), leaf sizes (1-45
    cm2) and morphologies (e.g. both broad- and needle-leaved species).  ^p Individual
    leaves ^p We determined the flammability of individual leaves under carefully
    controlled conditions (here called 'intrinsic' flammability) in order to test
    whether differences among species in flammability did or did not relate to differences
    in key leaf traits and to decomposition rates. We used individual leaves (following
    Gill & Moore 1996; Zylstra 2011) to distinguish measured differences in intrinsic
    flammability rather than differences in flammability due to variation in the fuel
    bed packing density (which is strongly related to leaf size) and therefore oxygen
    limitation (Scarff & Westoby 2006; van Altena et al. 2012; de Magalhaes & Schwilk
    2012). We expect that traits other than leaf size play a role when oxygen is not
    limiting.

  notes: The raw dataset includes data on all traits for live leaves, dried (live)
    leaves, and senesced leaves. For leaf length, width, thickness, ... only data
    on fresh, live leaves is integrated into AusTraits, but the complete dataset is
    available in the raw data folder for the study.

    This trait was recalculated for AusTraits using the standard formulation, the
    one-sided surface area of a fresh leaf divided by its ovendry mass (Prez-Harguindeguy
    et al. 2013). However, for the purpose of this study, we did not oven-dry the
    samples because we were particularly interested in the flammability across the
    three material types in the actual condition they were in (i.e. fresh, dried and
    senesced). We therefore named this variable, based on the actual weight, 'SLA*'.
    Data for 'SLA*' are also present in the data file but not incorporated into AusTraits.

    Subsamples for fuel moisture content (FMC) were held apart; leaves were measured
    at their actual weight and remeasured after 24 h of drying at 105 deg C, when
    equilibrium was reached (Matthews 2010). Fuel moisture content, as a percentage
    of oven dried weight, was then defined as follows, (leaf mass - leaf dry mass)/(leaf

  methods: Individual leaf specimens were exposed to a temperature of 400 deg C in
    a muffle furnace with a chamber size of 15 x 10 x 23 cm (Charles Moloney, Sydney;
    experimental conditions following Gill & Moore 1996; Zylstra 2011). The furnace
    door was kept open during the measurements to assure there was an abundant oxygen
    supply and to provide the opportunity to film the processes within. The furnace
    was used in a well-ventilated room without strong drafts. As a result of the open
    door, there was a temperature gradient inside the furnace. Three thermocouples
    (type K, chromel-alumel) were adjusted to a gauze steel cradle perpendicular to
    the opening of the furnace. The thermocouples were connected to a computer via
    a CR10WP data logger (Campbell Scientific, Logan, UT, USA). When the average temperature
    value of the three thermocouples was c. 400 degC (+/-10 degC), leaf samples were
    inserted. ^p  After running a series of pilot experiments at a variety of temperatures,
    a set temperature of 400 degC was chosen to be sure that most of the samples would
    ignite while at the same time, this temperature left enough opportunity for detecting
    differences in flammability across species. Besides, the volatiles of plant-based
    material tend to ignite at temperatures between 300 and 600 degC (DeBano, Neary
    & Ffolliott 1998) and during fires in dry sclerophyll forests, the temperatures
    range roughly from 100 to 1100 degC (Wotton et al. 2012). We consider the set
    temperature of 400 degC therefore as a reasonable representation of field conditions.
    ^p  Leaf samples were horizontally placed in the middle of the oven, with their
    direction parallel to the furnace door. They were held just above the cradle surface,
    c. 3-5 cm above the furnace floor. Samples were held by tongs on the petiole.
    For some samples (e.g. Macrozamia communis and Eucalyptus haemostoma), it was
    necessary to cut off a part of the leaf tip so the sample would fit in the furnace.
    To provide a source of ignition, a high-frequency electrical spark gun was held
    c. 8 mm above the centre of each specimen (Gill & Moore 1996). This spark gun
    was inserted simultaneously with the leaf sample and removed as soon as the sample
    ignited. Filter paper was used as a control, to satisfy ourselves that the method
    used was reproducible. The entire combustion process was videotaped and subsequently
    analysed by using the digital video editor VideoPad (NCH Software, Canberra, ACT,
    Australia). ^p This experimental set-up allowed us to measure TTI as a proxy for
    ignitibility, while sustainability was represented by both FD and SD. TTI was
    defined as the time from insertion into the furnace (and sparking) till the first
    visible flame. All these measurements were made in seconds, with an accuracy of
    one-tenth of a second (decimals).

    & Ffolliott 1998) and during fires in dry sclerophyll forests, the temperatures
    range roughly from 100 to 1100 degC (Wotton et al. 2012). We consider the set
    temperature of 400 degC therefore as a reasonable representation of field conditions.
    ^p  Leaf samples were horizontally placed in the middle of the oven, with their
    direction parallel to the furnace door. They were held just above the cradle surface,
    c. 3-5 cm above the furnace floor. Samples were held by tongs on the petiole.
    For some samples (e.g. Macrozamia communis and Eucalyptus haemostoma), it was
    necessary to cut off a part of the leaf tip so the sample would fit in the furnace.
    To provide a source of ignition, a high-frequency electrical spark gun was held
    c. 8 mm above the centre of each specimen (Gill & Moore 1996). This spark gun
    was inserted simultaneously with the leaf sample and removed as soon as the sample
    ignited. Filter paper was used as a control, to satisfy ourselves that the method
    used was reproducible. The entire combustion process was videotaped and subsequently
    analysed by using the digital video editor VideoPad (NCH Software, Canberra, ACT,
    Australia). ^p This experimental set-up allowed us to measure TTI as a proxy for
    ignitibility, while sustainability was represented by both FD and SD. SD was defined
    as the time from when no more flames could be seen, until the glowing phase died
    out. TBT is the sum of FD + SD. All these measurements were made in seconds, with
    an accuracy of one-tenth of a second (decimals).
