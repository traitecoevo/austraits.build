  description: Assessing the influence of low to moderate intensity and severity fire
    on the survival and resprouting responses of eucalypt overstorey trees (resprouters)
    and mixed species understorey trees.
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: A network of permanent plots was established to monitor tree
    growth, mortality and recruitment in TWEF, in order to increase our understanding
    of how climate influences their structure, composition and carbon dynamics over
    large spatial scales, (Wood et al., 2015). A total of 48 1-ha forest plots, including
    14 in Tasmania, were established between 2012 and 2015 in TWEF across Australia.
    The targeted forest stands were dominated by tall eucalypt forest species, with
    canopy dominants > 45 m tall, and the growth stage was standardised to mature
    trees that regenerated following major disturbance approximately 75-160 years
    previously. ^p Our study focuses on the five Tasmanian plots recently burnt by
    wildfire, as described below. The dominant eucalypt species in three of the four
    southern sites is Eucalyptus obliqua, a post-fire facultative resprouter/seeder
    (Table A.1; Table A.2). The fourth southern site is dominated by Eucalyptus regnans,
    regarded as an obligate seeder (Nicolle, 2006), with some E. obliqua trees also
    present. E. regnans is also found at one of the E. obliqua-dominated sites. The
    northern, higher elevation site is dominated by Eucalyptus delegatensis subsp.
    tasmaniensis. This subspecies, unlike its obligate seeder mainland counterpart,
    is a post-fire facultative resprouter/seeder (Poulos et al., 2018, Rodriguez-Cubillo
    et al., 2020). The most abundant understorey species were Pomaderris apetala,
    Nothofagus cunninghamii, Acacia melanoxylon and Nematolepis squamea, which were
    all common to multiple sites (Table A.2). ^p We visited the five plots in November
    2019 (10 months after the Riveaux Road fire) to document the effects on mortality
    and resprouting of eucalypts and understorey species. When the permanent plots
    were established between January 2012 and January 2015, all woody stems > 10 cm
    diameter at breast height (DBH) were tagged with a unique identification number,
    and their location was recorded on a 100 x 100 m grid (Wood et al 2014; Fig. A.2).
    The species, DBH and whether they were alive or dead were then documented. For
    our study, trees were located, using their position on the grid if the aluminium
    tags were missing or unreadable after the fire. We assessed the status (alive,
    dead, and presence of basal or epicormic resprouts) of all tagged trees in the
    five burnt 1.0 ha permanent plots, as well as in the additional 0.6 ha surrounding
    the flux tower included in the Warra supersite (Wood et al., 2014, Wardlaw, 2021).
    Trees were considered alive if any green leaves were present, including on epicormic
    and/or basal resprouts. If a tree had fallen or snapped post fire, this was recorded,
    but it was considered alive if it still had green leaves present. Trees that were
    standing dead when the plots were established were measured but not tagged, and
    hence were excluded from the current study. At the time of establishment of the
    individual plots, 13-26% of eucalypts, and 3-12% of understorey trees â‰¥ 10 cm
    DBH in each plot were recorded as dead. Also excluded from the current study were
    the 4.5% of eucalypts and 1.4% of understorey trees that were alive and tagged
    when the plot was established, but that appeared to have died before the fire.
    ^p We did not include trees < 10 cm DBH in this study, as they had not been tagged
    pre-fire. Small trees can be completely consumed by fire, and are often difficult
    to identify post-fire, so it is difficult to reliably assess their fate without
    pre-fire records. However, biomass assessments showed that before the fire, small
    live trees (mostly saplings of all species) were a substantial component of the
    live fine fuels in the elevated layer only at Arve, while both Arve and Mackenzie
    had high fine fuel loads in shrubs (Table A.1; Fig. 10 of Furlaud and Bowman,
    2020). Tree ferns were common at all sites except Arve. The fires virtually eliminated
    the shrubs and saplings, but most tree ferns survived and resprouted (Furlaud
    and Bowman, 2020). ^p Field assessments of fire intensity were made 10 months
    after the respective fires, in November 2016 (Mackenzie fire) and November 2019
    (Riveaux Road fire). Fire intensity, defined as the time-averaged energy flux,
    is difficult to measure directly with high spatial resolution during a wildfire
    (Keeley, 2009). We therefore used char height, which is an indicator of flame
    height, as a proxy for fire intensity (Alexander and Cruz, 2012). We divided each
    plot into four 50 m x 50 m (0.25 ha) subplots, and averaged the char height on
    all non-eucalypt overstorey trees in each subplot. Eucalypts were omitted because
    the fibrous bark of species such as E. obliqua and E. delegatensis can carry flames
    up the stems, leading to overestimates of the fire intensity (Alexander and Cruz,
    2012). ^p For presentation of some results, fire intensity was classed as low
    (<2 m average char height), moderate (2-5 m average char height) or high (>5 m
    average char height) (Wood et al., 2014), but char height (as a continuous variable)
    was used in our statistical analyses. In our intensity and canopy scorch analyses,
    we did not include trees in the additional 0.6 ha at the Warra supersite, because
    these are located around the flux tower and surrounding infrastructure, which
    could have influenced the fire intensity and severity in that area. ^p Fire severity
    describes how fire intensity affects ecosystems, and is often measured by crown
    volume scorch (Keeley, 2009). We visually assessed percent canopy defoliation
    as a measure of scorch in November 2019. No canopy scorch assessments were made
    at Mackenzie, because almost five years had elapsed since the fire.
  original_file: in raw data folder
  notes: The raw data files submitted by the contributor score individual trees as
    being killed vs alive and as having/not having epicormic/basal sprouts following
    the fires. These data are linked to canopy scorch scores and DBH measurements
    for the individual trees. For inclusion in AusTraits the data have been manipulated
    to provide population-level ("subplots") values, as our fire_response traits are
    population or taxon level traits, not individual-level traits. An average scorch
    value and DBH summary statistics (median, min, max) are retained as context properties. The raw data
    file and the R code used to rework the data are archived in the raw data folder
    within the GitHub data repository.

  methods: When the permanent plots were established between January 2012 and January
    2015, all woody stems > 10 cm diameter at breast height (DBH) were tagged with
    a unique identification number, and their location was recorded on a 100 x100
    m grid (Wood et al 2014; Fig. A.2). The species, DBH and whether they were alive
    or dead were then documented. For our study, trees were located, using their position
    on the grid if the aluminium tags were missing or unreadable after the fire. We
    assessed the status (alive, dead, and presence of basal or epicormic resprouts)
    of all tagged trees in the five burnt 1.0 ha permanent plots, as well as in the
    additional 0.6 ha surrounding the flux tower included in the Warra supersite (Wood
    et al., 2014, Wardlaw, 2021). Trees were considered alive if any green leaves
    were present, including on epicormic and/or basal resprouts. If a tree had fallen
    or snapped post fire, this was recorded, but it was considered alive if it still
    had green leaves present.
