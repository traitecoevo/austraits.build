  description: data on genome size collected from fresh leaf samples on the majority
    (c. 900 taxa) of Eucalyptus, Angophora and Corymbia species at the Currency Creek
    Arboretum, South Australia. Samples were sent to the laboratory of Jan Suda for
    processing using flow cytometry.
  basis_of_record: captive_cultivated
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: A single leaf from each individual was picked and packed for
    rapid, chilled transport to the lab in the Czech Republic (Dr Jan Suda). All samples
    were linked ot a vouchered specimen with colection numbers from Dean Nicolle.
    Genome size was measured via flow cytometry.
