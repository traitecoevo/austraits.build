  sampling_strategy: Our database of C3 and C4 photosynthetic types in grasses is based principally on published anatomical and stable carbon isotope evidence. We followed previous authors in assuming that all species within each genus shared the same photosynthetic pathway, unless the evidence suggested otherwise. However, we also measured d13C for 99 species that had not previously been surveyed, including 96 species of Panicum s.l., Acostia gracilis, Lophopogon tridentatus and Thedachloa annua (Supporting Information Table S1). We also obtained information on leaf anatomy and measured d13Cto check previous unverified reports of aC3 species (Stipagrostis paradisea) in an otherwise C4 genus (Sage et al., 1999a), and a C4 subspecies (Chaetobromus dregeanus ssp. involucratus) in an otherwise C3 subfamily (Danthonioideae; Watson & Dallwitz, 1992 onwards). In both cases, our data contradicted previous reports, showing that the photosynthetic pathway of these taxa matches that of their close relatives; S. paradisea is C4 and C. dregeanus ssp. involucratus is C3 (Table 1). The photosynthetic pathways of Taeniorhachis repens, Veldkampia sagaingensis and 39 rare species of Panicum s.l. remain unclassified, because we were unable to take samples of type specimens from herbarium collections. Most of these species are endemics of Madagascar (26 species), and the remaining 13 species are endemics of a small number of countries in Africa and Southeast Asia, and oceanic islands (Table S2). This means that the database is complete for most countries of the world. Our approach has been to map the photosynthetic pathway data onto accepted species names in the Poaceae taxonomy of Clayton& Renvoize (1986) and Clayton et al. (2002b onwards), which is the most comprehensive treatment of accepted names and synonymy for grasses (see Methods S1 for full methodology). Coupling our dataset with this synonymy allows users to return the photosynthetic type for all except 46 (corresponding to 41 accepted species) of the 62 678 published scientific names (accepted names and synonyms) for grasses (Clayton et al., 2002b onwards). We have developed software tools to facilitate this task for users, which are detailed in the following. The database covers 99.6% of the 11 087 grass species. It shows that 42% of these species use the C4 photosynthetic pathway and 57% the C3 pathway (Table S3; Notes S1). Six genera (Alloteropsis, Aristida, Eragrostis, Neurachne, Panicum s.l., and Streptostachys s.l.) contain both C3 and C4 species (Tables 1, S4). Seven C3–C4 intermediate species (Table 1) are distributed between the genera Neurachne (one species) and Steinchisma (six species). Within the genus Panicum s.l., 169 species are C4, 250 are C3, and 41 remain unknown, with the photosynthetic type of Panicum ruspolii ambiguous on the basis of new d13C measurements (Tables S1, S2, S4; Notes S1). The latter species may be a previously unrecognized C3–C4 intermediate, but further work is required to test this hypothesis. A number of further potential C3–C4 intermediates have been identified on the basis of anatomical observations (Tables 1, S3), and also need to be investigated physiologically. These areDregeochloa calviniensis (most mesophyll cells are no more than one cell distant from bundle sheath cells; Watson & Dallwitz, 1992 onwards), Homolepis aturensis and Streptostachys asperifolia (concentration of chloroplasts in large bundle sheath cells; Christin et al., 2013; P-A. Christin, pers. comm.). In total there are therefore 11 putative C3–C4 intermediates in the grasses.

  question for Austraits: why isn't C3 vs C4 data included in datafile, since this is the main focus of their database? What collection type should I asign to a data compilation study?
