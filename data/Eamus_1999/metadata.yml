  description: Seasonal variations in carbon assimilation of eight tree species of
    a north Australian tropical savanna wereexamined over two wet seasons and one
    dry season (18 months).
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: Eight species were chosen to represent the dominant (in terms
    of standing biomass) evergreen, semi-deciduous and deciduous species and to complement
    the studies of Myers et al. (1997), Prior et al. (1997a, 1997b) and Williams et
    al. (1997). Three deciduous species (Planchonia careya (F. Muell.) Kunth, Terminalia
    ferdinandiana, and Cochlospermum fraseri Planchon), three semi-deciduous species
    (Erythrophleum chlorostachys, Xanthostemon paradoxus, and Eucalyptus clavigera
    A. Cunn. ex Schauer) and two evergreen species (Eucalytpus tetrodonta, and E.
    miniata) were chosen. The eight species represent more than 90% of standing biomass
    and more than 90% of tree canopy leaf area. The trees were between 4 and 7 m tall.
    Scaffolding was used to access the upper canopies.

    latitude (deg): -12.5753
    longitude (deg): 131.1022
    rainfall (mm): 1600
    description: The study was conducted at Solar Village (12°37' S, 131°10' E), 35
      km southeast of Darwin, Australia. Vegetation is open forest (sensu Specht 1981)
      dominated by Eucalyptus tetrodonta F. Muell. and E. miniata A. Cunn. ex Schauer
      with sub-canopy dominants mostly comprising Erythrophleum chlorostachys (F.
      Muell.) Baillon, Xanthostemon paradoxus F. Muell. and Terminalia ferdinandiana
      Excell. Perennial and some annual grasses (Sorghum, Chrysopogon and Ericahne
      spp.) are present in the understory. Rainfall is about 1600 mm per annum, 90%
      of which falls between December and March inclusive (wet season). Mean maximum
      and minimum temperatures are 31.8 and 24.8°C, respectively, in the wet season
      and 30.5 and 20.0 °C, respectively, in the dry season. Seasonal variations in
      microclimate, water relations and phenology have been described by Duff et al.
      (1997), Myers et al. (1997) and Williams et al. (1997).

  methods: The area of fresh leaves was measured with a Delta-T Devices leaf area
    meter (Cambridge, U.K.). Leaves were then dried at 70 °C to constant weight. Five
    leaves from each of seven trees of each species were sampled at the same time
    as leaves were harvested for determination of A. Specific leaf area (SLA) was
    determined in mid-January, from the ratio of leaf area to dry weight.

  methods: Three leaves were then stored in a sealed plastic bag in the dark overnight
    for determination of total foliar Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) by a micro-Kjeldahl
    procedure. Samples of 0.2 g were digested in concentrated sulfuric acid and subjected
    to quantitative flow injection analysis (QuickChem method 13-107-06-2-D; Lachat
    Instruments, Milwaukee, WI).Leaves were dried at 70 °C to constant weight.

  methods: Light-saturated assimilation was measured with an LI-6200 portable photosynthesis
    unit (Li-Cor, Inc., Lincoln, NE). Three fully expanded healthy leaves from the
    upper canopy of each of seven trees were measured in the morning (between 0900
    h and 1200 h) or afternoon (1400 h to 1530 h) under light-saturating conditions
    (PAR > 1000 mmol m-2 s-1) in October (end of dry season), late March (end of wet
    season), May (early dry season), July (mid-dry season), October (end of dry season),
    and early February (mid-wet season). Leaves were dried at 70 °C to constant weight.
