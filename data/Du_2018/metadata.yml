  description: A glasshouse experiment to determine the possible trade-offs between
    shrub water use for stormwater management and their response to drought conditions,
    to better identify ideal species for green or vegetated roofs.
  collection_type: glasshouse
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: Plant material  ^p     In this experiment, 20 shrubs were selected
    from different climates of origin across southern Australia based on their heat
    moisture index (HMI; Table 1). We used species occurrence records in the Atlas
    of Living Australia (ALA) to determine the climate envelope of each species (records
    available online).2 For each species, mean annual temperature (MAT) and mean annual
    precipitation (MAP) were determined for each location that the species had been
    recorded and these were used to calculate HMI for each location. HMI was calculated
    as follows, (MAT + 10)/ MAP*1,000. The mean HMI ranged from 20 to 98 and MAP from
    280 to 1,100 mm. Species with higher HMI were distributed in drier and hotter
    sites, while species with lower HMI were from wetter and cooler regions.  ^p     Six-month-old
    seedlings in tube stock, 20 plants per species, were obtained from an indigenous
    commercial nursery (Goldfields Revegetation, Mandurang, Victoria, Australia).
    All plants were individually potted into 6-L plastic pots (200 mm diameter and
    190 mm height) containing green roof substrate (3.8 kg/pot) consisting of 60%
    scoria 7 mm minus block mix, 20% 7 mm scoria aggregate, and 20% composted coir
    (Farrell et al. 2012). Low-phosphorous slow-release fertilizer (12 g/pot; Osmocote
    plus, Scotts Australia) containing 61% nitrogen, 34% potassium, and 5% phosphorus
    was added to the surface of each pot at planting. For the establishment period,
    three months before the start of the experiment, plants were grown outside and
    were watered automatically for 30 min twice a day (06:00 and 18:00) to ensure
    sufficient water availability. The experiment was conducted in the nursery at
    the Burnley Campus, University of Melbourne, Australia (37deg47'S; 144deg58'E).  ^p     Experimental
    design  ^p     In March 2016, plants were moved into a glasshouse and watered
    by hand for another week before the experiment started. Five replicates of each
    of the 20 species with uniform size were allocated randomly to two different watering
    treatments, well-watered (WW) and water deficit (WD), and arranged in a complete
    randomized block design. The remaining 100 pots (five replicates per species)
    were used for the initial harvest to determine plant biomass. WW plants were watered
    to pot capacity at 17:00 three times per week (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday).
    The plants in the WD treatment were also watered at the same time with the quantity
    of water added determined from the water use of each individual species under
    WW. That is, 50% of the water used by WW plants (calculated by the difference
    in pot mass of WW plants after the last watering and before the current watering
    event) was added to WD plants using a measuring cylinder. All pots were weighed
    before being watered and again after watering to determine plant water use and
    soil water content (SWC). Watering treatments continued until each plant in the
    WD treatment had experienced 30 d of SWC below 20% to enable them to adjust physiologically
    to water stress conditions. Consequently, different species were harvested on
    different days based on their dry-down rates.

- var_in: ET (g H2O/day/cm2)
  unit_in: g/day/cm2
  trait_name: whole_plant_transpiration
  value_type: raw_value
  replicates: '1'
  methods: Cumulative evapotranspiration per pot was determined as the sum of evapotranspiration
    over the 42-81 d of the experiment, depending on each species' dry-down rate.
    Daily evapotranspiration rate (g H2O pot-1 d-1) was then determined from cumulative
    evapotranspiration. (AusTraits scaled this number to total plant leaf area.)
- var_in: SLA (m2/kg leaf)
  unit_in: m2/kg
  trait_name: specific_leaf_area
  value_type: raw_value
  replicates: '1'
  methods: Five replicates of 20 species were initially harvested prior to the watering
    treatments to obtain total plant dry mass, total leaf dry mass, and total leaf
    area. Leaf area was measured using a LI3100 area meter (Li-Cor, Lincoln, Nebraska,
    USA). Total leaf and stem dry mass was recorded separately after drying in a 70degC
    oven for at least 48 h or until constant mass was reached. Specific leaf area
    (SLA; m2/kg leaf) and leaf area ratio (LAR, m2 leaf/kg plant) were calculated
    from leaf area and dry leaf/whole-plant mass. These measurements were repeated
    at the conclusion of the experiment on all WW and WD plants. The difference in
    mass between the final and initial harvests was also used to calculate relative
    growth rate (RGR) of WW and WD treatments and was determined as follows, (final
    dry mass - initial dry mass)/(initial dry mass/d).
