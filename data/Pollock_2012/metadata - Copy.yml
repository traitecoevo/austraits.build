  description: Here, we bring together the fields of species distribution modelling
    and functional trait ecology with hierarchical modelling by explicitly incorporating
    traits into a multi-species distribution model. We combined traits from the leaf-height-seed
    strategy scheme (specifi c leaf area (SLA), plant height and seed mass) with a
    distribution model for 20 eucalypt taxa in Victoria, Australia.
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: We collected species occurrence, trait and environmental data
    in 458 plots for the 20 species of Eucalyptus that occur in the Grampians National
    Park, Victoria, Australia. The Grampians NP has a Mediterranean-type climate with
    a warm summers and mild wet winters (Fig. 1). Habitats associated with differing
    species assemblages in the Grampians include rocky outcrops, sand sheets, and
    riparian areas (Enright et al. 1994). Main environmental gradients range from
    high exposed sandstone outcrops at 800-1000 m a.s.l. to alluvial outwash plains
    at ~ 200 m a.s.l. ^p Most environmental variables thought to influence eucalypt
    species distributions in this region vary with elevation, so we explicitly incorporated
    elevational gradients into the sampling design. We adopted the rationale of a
    gradsect sampling scheme (Austin and Heyligers 1989) by intentionally locating
    plots across the range of environmental variables. We established plots along
    elevation gradients throughout the Grampians National Park. At a coarse-scale,
    elevation correlates to changes in climatic variables, and fi ne-scale elevation
    gradients span changes in soil type, rock cover, and water drainage patterns.
    ^p We began by placing a plot at the top of a peak (or hilltop in the lowlands)
    and establishing subsequent plots as we descended downslope tracking along a particular
    aspect. The distance between plots was a minimum of 50 m apart, and varied depending
    on environmental heterogeneity. These walking routes can be loosely defined as
    transects, but differ from many transects in that they were irregularly sampled,
    often with large distances (1 km) between plots, and two transects were sometimes
    closer in geographic space than plots along a particular transect. We avoided
    sampling within 40 m of roads and tracks, although tracks generally provided entry
    points in rugged terrain. Ecotones with high species turnover were sampled intensively
    (e.g. fi ne-scale soil texture differences in lowland areas) and rare species
    populations were sampled more intensively than homogenous stands, and multiple
    plots in the same geographic area with the same species composition were avoided.
    For each plot, we randomly located target trees along the descent. The target
    tree formed the center of the plot. We then measured the four nearest congeneric
    and conspecific trees (within a 20-m radius), so plot size varied with tree density.
    We also measured environmental variables in plots (see the Environmental variables
    section for details). We assessed the coverage of species, geographic space, and
    environmental space midway through plot collection. Then, we intentionally placed
    elevational transects through populations of rare species with few recorded locations,
    and under-sampled environmental space.

    a minimum of 20 estimates of tree height for each species, but the actual sampling
    number varied from 10 to 40 depending on species abundance.

    SLA is the one-sided leaf surface area of fresh leaves divided by the mass of
    leaves oven-dried at 65 deg C for 48 h. SLA was measured for at least 5 leaves
    from each of 5 individuals.
