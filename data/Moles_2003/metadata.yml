  description: We investigated the relationship between seed size and seed survival
    in the soil in 67 species from arid Australia.
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: This study was performed in Sturt National Park, north-west New
    South Wales, Australia. Seven sites were located within Sturt National Park, in
    order to maximize the number of species included in this study. The sites included
    a granite outcrop (Dead Horse Gully; 29 25 38  S, 141 59 36  E); granite covered
    plains (8-mile Creek; 29 20 08  S, 142 01 49  E and Gum Vale; 29 12 52  S, 141
    53 49  E); the shores of Lake Pinaroo (29 05 21  S, 141 13 03  E); sand dunes
    near Fort Grey (a dune crest; 29 02 50  S, 141 11 38  E and a dune swale; 29 01
    50  S; 141 11 27  E), and the Olive Downs plateau (29 03 40  S; 141 51 45  E).
    All species that were represented by at least five fruiting individuals, carrying
    a combined total of at least 150 ripe seeds at the time of fieldwork, were included
    in this study. This resulted in initial viability data for 68 species, and survival
    data for 67 species from 14 families (Table 1). Diaspores rather then seeds were
    used as the unit of study, as it is the diaspore rather than the seed that is
    dispersed and incorporated into the soil.

traits:
- var_in: Diaspore mass (mg)
  unit_in: mg
  trait_name: diaspore_mass
  value_type: site_mean
  replicates: '>5'
  methods: This is the mass of the seed and all of the accessory structures with which
    it is dispersed. Twenty diaspores of each species were oven-dried at 60 degrees
    C for at least 3 days, allowed to cool in a desiccator and then weighed on a Cahn
    microbalance.
- var_in: Seed viability
  unit_in: '%'
  trait_name: seed_viability
  value_type: site_mean
  replicates: .na
  methods: Viability of a minimum of 45 seeds of each species was assessed within
    2 weeks of seed collection from the field using standard tetrazolium chloride
    staining techniques (Moore 1985). Where necessary, diaspores were dissected before
    staining such that the embryos were exposed to the tetrazolium solution. Diaspores
    were soaked in a 0.5% solution of tetrazolium chloride at room temperature for
    approximately 24 h before assessment. Seeds were considered to be viable if the
    entire embryo stained red.
