  description: We investigated the relationship between seed size and seed survival
    in the soil in 67 species from arid Australia.
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: This study was performed in Sturt National Park, north-west New
    South Wales, Australia. Seven sites were located within Sturt National Park, in
    order to maximize the number of species included in this study. The sites included
    a granite outcrop (Dead Horse Gully; 29 deg 25' 38"  S, 141 deg 59' 36"  E); granite
    covered plains (8-mile Creek; 29 deg 20' 08"  S, 142 deg 01' 49"  E and Gum Vale;
    29 deg 12' 52"  S, 141 deg 53' 49"  E); the shores of Lake Pinaroo (29 deg 05'
    21"  S, 141 deg 13' 03"  E); sand dunes near Fort Grey (a dune crest; 29 deg 02'
    50"  S, 141 deg 11' 38"  E and a dune swale; 29 deg 01' 50"  S; 141 deg 11' 27"  E),
    and the Olive Downs plateau (29 deg 03' 40"  S; 141 deg 51' 45"  E). All species
    that were represented by at least five fruiting individuals, carrying a combined
    total of at least 150 ripe seeds at the time of fieldwork, were included in this
    study. This resulted in initial viability data for 68 species, and survival data
    for 67 species from 14 families (Table 1). Diaspores rather then seeds were used
    as the unit of study, as it is the diaspore rather than the seed that is dispersed
    and incorporated into the soil.

traits:
- var_in: Diaspore mass (mg)
  unit_in: mg
  trait_name: diaspore_dry_mass
  entity_type: population
  value_type: mean
  basis_of_value: measurement
  replicates: 20
  methods: This is the mass of the seed and all of the accessory structures with which
    it is dispersed. Twenty diaspores of each species were oven-dried at 60 degrees
    C for at least 3 days, allowed to cool in a desiccator and then weighed on a Cahn
    microbalance.
- var_in: Seed viability
  unit_in: '%'
  trait_name: seed_viability
  entity_type: population
  value_type: mean
  basis_of_value: measurement
  replicates: 45
  methods: Viability of a minimum of 45 seeds of each species was assessed within
    2 weeks of seed collection from the field using standard tetrazolium chloride
    staining techniques (Moore 1985). Where necessary, diaspores were dissected before
    staining such that the embryos were exposed to the tetrazolium solution. Diaspores
    were soaked in a 0.5% solution of tetrazolium chloride at room temperature for
    approximately 24 h before assessment. Seeds were considered to be viable if the
    entire embryo stained red.
