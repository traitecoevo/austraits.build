  description: growth and functional trait measurements in tropical forest to understand
    relationshop between growth, allometry, and trait values
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: Leaf trait data for all 41 species were collected in and around
    Danbulla National Park in far northern Queensland (situated at ~17 deg 07'30''S
    and 145deg37'30''E, within the area encompassed by the permanent plots) in October
    2013 and May 2014. All leaf trait measurements were made on outer canopy leaves
    to reduce any variation due to light environment. For three to eight adult individuals
    of each species we measured Aarea, individual leaf mass and area (for SLA), and
    leaf nutrient concentrations.

  methods: Photosynthesis measurements were made between 08:30 am and 1:00 pm (generally
    before midday), on detached branches sampled from the outer canopy. Branch cut-points
    were immediately re-cut under water to re-establish a continuous water column,
    then the branch was brought to a LI-6400XT portable infrared gas analyser (LICOR
    Inc., Lincoln, NE, USA), fitted with 6 cm2 chamber with LED light source. Measurements
    were made under ambient CO2 concentrations (~400 mg L-1) and temperature (25-27
    deg C), and high light (2000 umol m-2 s-1). Cuvette vapour pressure difference
    ranged between 0.61 and 1.94 kPa.

  methods: For each individual on which photosynthesis measurements were made, three
    leaves were scanned and leaf area calculated using ImageJ software (US National
    Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA). Leaves were oven-dried at 60-70 deg
    C for at least 5 days and reweighed to determine dry mass. Specific leaf area
    was calculated by dividing leaf area by dry mass. Leaf nutrient analyses were
    performed at the Appleton Laboratory (University of Queensland).
