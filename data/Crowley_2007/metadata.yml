  description: An extract from an informal database (the version that formed the basis
    of the online database (Crowley G, Gardener M, Marrinan M (2007) Tropical savannas
    fire response database. Tropical Savannas Cooperative Research Centre, Darwin)),
    containing fire response data of tropical savanna species.
  basis_of_record: unknown
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: unknown
  original_file: See 'data/Nano_2011/raw/ecological_attributes.xlsx' ('Resprouting'
    sheet).
  notes: Database is no longer available online, so data was sourced from Catherine
    Nano (see 'data/Nano_2011/raw/ecological_attributes.xlsx'). 'Resprouting' sheet
    contains the data and 'LUT' sheet contains the key. The url (www.landmanager.org.au)
    is sourced from Simpson_2021 which also cited this database.
