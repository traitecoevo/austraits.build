  description: transposed from Morphometric analysis and revision of eastern Australian
    hovea (Brongniartieae-Fabaceae)
  collection_type: herbarium
  sample_age_class: adult_assumed
  sampling_strategy: Herbarium specimens from Australian herbaria (AD, BRI, HO, MEL,
    NE, NSW) and newly collected specimens of eastern Australian forms of Hovea (excluding
    H. longipes) were examined. Specimens were initially grouped according to perceived
    similarities in morphology, notwithstanding their current taxonomic status, and
    from these groups, specimens (five per group if possible), containing a sufficient
    number of measurable parts, were selected for morphometric analysis. In this way,
    maximal variation could be included in the analysis whilst keeping the number
    of specimens (184) to a manageable size.

questions:
  austraits: The methods indicate  10 specimens were measured for data
    such as leaf width, but the range has now been broken into min, max, etc. What
    should the number of replicates be?
  contributors: In the manuscript there aren't details on how plant height
    and flowering time were determined for each species. Can you briefly indicate
    if these values are based on your field observations or data on already collected
    herbarium specimens?
