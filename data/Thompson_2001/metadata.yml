  description: transposed from Morphometric analysis and revision of eastern Australian
    hovea (Brongniartieae-Fabaceae)
  collection_type: botanical_collection
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: Herbarium specimens from Australian herbaria (AD, BRI, HO, MEL,
    NE, NSW) and newly collected specimens of eastern Australian forms of Hovea (excluding
    H. longipes) were examined. Specimens were initially grouped according to perceived
    similarities in morphology, notwithstanding their current taxonomic status, and
    from these groups, specimens (five per group if possible), containing a sufficient
    number of measurable parts, were selected for morphometric analysis. In this way,
    maximal variation could be included in the analysis whilst keeping the number
    of specimens (184) to a manageable size.
