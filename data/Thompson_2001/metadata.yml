  description: transposed from Morphometric analysis and revision of eastern Australian
    hovea (Brongniartieae-Fabaceae)
  collection_type: herbarium specimens
  sample_age_class: adult_assumed
  site: .na
  sampling_strategy: Herbarium specimens from Australian herbaria (AD, BRI, HO, MEL, NE, NSW) and newly collected specimens of eastern Australian forms of Hovea (excluding H. longipes) were examined. Specimens were initially grouped according to perceived similarities in morphology, notwithstanding their current taxonomic status, and from these groups, specimens (five per group if possible), containing a sufficient number of measurable parts, were selected for morphometric analysis. In this way, maximal variation could be included in the analysis whilst keeping the number of specimens (184) to a manageable size.

  notes: .na
  questions for Austraits: The methods indicate  10 specimens were measured for data such as leaf width, but the range has now been broken into min, max, etc. What should the number of replicates be?
  questions for author: In the manuscript there aren't details on how plant height and flowering time were determined for each species. Can you briefly indicate if these values are based on your field observations or data on already collected herbarium specimens?
