  sampling_strategy: The study area in Australia was located in Jurien Bay, southwestern
    Australia, approximately 200 km north of Perth. The soils in this area were extremely
    P-impoverished, with soil [P] of 11 mg total P kg-1. Three sites were identified
    in this study area, two on the ~2-million-year old Bassendean stage of the Jurien
    Bay dune chronosequence and one on the much older Peron slopes (Hayes, Turner,
    Lambers, & Laliberte, 2014; Turner, Hayes, & Laliberte, 2017; Turner & Laliberte,
    2015). All samples were collected within <100 m, at each site. The three sites
    were located within a 9 x 4 km area and were dominated by kwongkan bushland (a
    Proteaceae-rich shrubland). ^p In Australia, eight species of Proteaceae were
    selected, from four genera, Banksia (Banksia attenuata R.Br., Banksia menziesii
    R.Br., and Banksia prionotes Lindl.), Hakea (Hakea flabellifolia Meisn., Hakea
    incrassata R.Br. and Hakea prostrata R. Br.), Persoonia (Persoonia comata Meisn.),
    and Petrophile (Petrophile macrostachya R.Br.).

  methods: 'Leaf samples for cell-specific element analysis were collected from the
    same plants and at the same time as for leaf nutrient analysis. From each individual
    plant,  only mature, undamaged, fully expanded, and sun-exposed leaves were sampled.
    Three samples were collected from up to two leaves, for each of the 21 individual
    plants. Upon removal of a leaf, small sections (~2 x 3 mm) were consistently cut
    from either side of the mid-rib, mid-way along the leaf, avoiding any large secondary
    veins. These sections were then mounted onto aluminium pins using optimal cutting
    temperature compound and plunged into liquid N (Figure S1a), thereby immediately
    immobilizing and preserving cellular ions. Samples were then stored in liquid
    N until preparation in a cryomicrotome and analysis using cryo-scanning electron
    microscopy. With this, all samples were collected fresh in the field, were immediately
    plunge frozen in liquid N, and were always kept under cryo-conditions, such that
    all elements were preserved in situ. Transverse regions of frozen hydrated leaf
    samples were prepared by cryoplaning a flat surface with a glass knife, followed
    by a diamond knife, at -120 deg C in a cryomicrotome (Leica EM FC6 cryochamber
    integrated with Leica Ultracut EM UC6 microtome). Leaves were progressively microtomed
    flat, initially on a glass knife at 1 um, 750 nm, and 500 nm steps and then finally
    with fine precision on a diamond knife at 250 and 100 nm steps. The pin was then
    mounted on a custom-made substage, transferred under an N gas environment to a
    Leica MED020 cryopreparation system, and sputter coated with 25-50 nm chromium,
    without sublimation. After coating, samples were transferred under vacuum to a
    Zeiss field emission scanning electron microscope fitted with a Leica VCT100 cryotransfer
    and stage, and an Oxford X-Max80 SDD X-ray detector interfaced to Oxford Instruments
    AZtecEnergy software (Figure S1b). This preparation method and this fully integrated
    Oxford analytical system have been shown to be highly suitable for elemental analysis
    and quantitation of biological samples (Huang, Canny, Oates, & McCully, 1994;
    Jin et al., 2017; Marshall, 2017; Marshall & Clode, 2009; Marshall, Goodyear,
    & Crewther, 2012; Marshall & Xu, 1998; McCully, Canny, Huang, Miller, & Brink,
    2010). Samples were analysed at -150  deg C, 15 kV, and a 2 nA beam current (measured
    using a faraday cup), in high-current mode. Prior to each map acquisition, the
    instrument was calibrated, and the beam current was measured using a pure copper
    standard. Elemental maps were acquired at a resolution of 512 pixels, for >3,000
    frames with a dwell time of 10 micro seconds per pixel. Drift correction and pulse-pile
    up correction were activated. Using the Oxford Instruments AZtecEnergy software,
    quantitative numerical data were subsequently extracted from regions of interest
    drawn on the element maps (Figure S1c), with individual spectra from each pixel
    within the region of interest summed and processed to yield element concentration
    data. Summed spectra from regions of interest were quantified using the AZtec
    XPP model for matrix corrections using standard files included within the software
    package. Regions of interest represented various areas and individual cells of
    interest. Different cells were readily identified and classified, based on their
    leaf anatomy, cell appearance, and element levels. Only cells that were clearly
    identifiable and had a flat surface were analysed, with airspaces, for example,
    avoided (Figure S1d,e). Because the central vacuole occupies most of the volume
    in a plant cell, it is assumed that the reported measurements typically reflect
    vacuolar concentrations. Different species possess different anatomy and combinations
    of cell types (Table S3; Figures S2-S6). Overall, the following six cell types
    were confidently identified and analysed: epidermis (EP), hypodermis (HY), palisade
    mesophyll (PM), spongy mesophyll (SM), internal parenchyma (IP), and sclerenchyma
    (SC). In some species, some of these cell types accumulated Ca differentially,
    with Ca not in all cells. In such cases, these were further subdivided, on the
    basis of their [Ca]. Calcium- accumulating cells were identified with the suffix
    Ca for example, HY.Ca, PM.Ca, SM.Ca, and IP.Ca. In total, 2,789 cells were analysed,
    with 7-117 cells analysed for each cell type within each species, across three
    individual plants (Table S3). The element maps for P are not presented because
    they did not pictorally reveal the distribution/variations in P, due to the consistently
    low levels of P; however, quantitation of [P] from regions of interest was still
    readily achievable (Figure S1f-h).'

  methods: 'Leaf samples for cell-specific element analysis were collected from the
    same plants and at the same time as for leaf nutrient analysis. From each individual
    plant,  only mature, undamaged, fully expanded, and sun-exposed leaves were sampled.
    Three samples were collected from up to two leaves, for each of the 21 individual
    plants. Upon removal of a leaf, small sections (~2 x 3 mm) were consistently cut
    from either side of the mid-rib, mid-way along the leaf, avoiding any large secondary
    veins. These sections were then mounted onto aluminium pins using optimal cutting
    temperature compound and plunged into liquid N (Figure S1a), thereby immediately
    immobilizing and preserving cellular ions. Samples were then stored in liquid
    N until preparation in a cryomicrotome and analysis using cryo-scanning electron
    microscopy. With this, all samples were collected fresh in the field, were immediately
    plunge frozen in liquid N, and were always kept under cryo-conditions, such that
    all elements were preserved in situ. Transverse regions of frozen hydrated leaf
    samples were prepared by cryoplaning a flat surface with a glass knife, followed
    by a diamond knife, at -120 deg C in a cryomicrotome (Leica EM FC6 cryochamber
    integrated with Leica Ultracut EM UC6 microtome). Leaves were progressively microtomed
    flat, initially on a glass knife at 1 um, 750 nm, and 500 nm steps and then finally
    with fine precision on a diamond knife at 250 and 100 nm steps. The pin was then
    mounted on a custom-made substage, transferred under an N gas environment to a
    Leica MED020 cryopreparation system, and sputter coated with 25-50 nm chromium,
    without sublimation. After coating, samples were transferred under vacuum to a
    Zeiss field emission scanning electron microscope fitted with a Leica VCT100 cryotransfer
    and stage, and an Oxford X-Max80 SDD X-ray detector interfaced to Oxford Instruments
    AZtecEnergy software (Figure S1b). This preparation method and this fully integrated
    Oxford analytical system have been shown to be highly suitable for elemental analysis
    and quantitation of biological samples (Huang, Canny, Oates, & McCully, 1994;
    Jin et al., 2017; Marshall, 2017; Marshall & Clode, 2009; Marshall, Goodyear,
    & Crewther, 2012; Marshall & Xu, 1998; McCully, Canny, Huang, Miller, & Brink,
    2010). Samples were analysed at -150  deg C, 15 kV, and a 2 nA beam current (measured
    using a faraday cup), in high-current mode. Prior to each map acquisition, the
    instrument was calibrated, and the beam current was measured using a pure copper
    standard. Elemental maps were acquired at a resolution of 512 pixels, for >3,000
    frames with a dwell time of 10 micro seconds per pixel. Drift correction and pulse-pile
    up correction were activated. Using the Oxford Instruments AZtecEnergy software,
    quantitative numerical data were subsequently extracted from regions of interest
    drawn on the element maps (Figure S1c), with individual spectra from each pixel
    within the region of interest summed and processed to yield element concentration
    data. Summed spectra from regions of interest were quantified using the AZtec
    XPP model for matrix corrections using standard files included within the software
    package. Regions of interest represented various areas and individual cells of
    interest. Different cells were readily identified and classified, based on their
    leaf anatomy, cell appearance, and element levels. Only cells that were clearly
    identifiable and had a flat surface were analysed, with airspaces, for example,
    avoided (Figure S1d,e). Because the central vacuole occupies most of the volume
    in a plant cell, it is assumed that the reported measurements typically reflect
    vacuolar concentrations. Different species possess different anatomy and combinations
    of cell types (Table S3; Figures S2-S6). Overall, the following six cell types
    were confidently identified and analysed: epidermis (EP), hypodermis (HY), palisade
    mesophyll (PM), spongy mesophyll (SM), internal parenchyma (IP), and sclerenchyma
    (SC). In some species, some of these cell types accumulated Ca differentially,
    with Ca not in all cells. In such cases, these were further subdivided, on the
    basis of their [Ca]. Calcium- accumulating cells were identified with the suffix
    Ca for example, HY.Ca, PM.Ca, SM.Ca, and IP.Ca. In total, 2,789 cells were analysed,

    data. Summed spectra from regions of interest were quantified using the AZtec
    XPP model for matrix corrections using standard files included within the software
    package. Regions of interest represented various areas and individual cells of
    interest. Different cells were readily identified and classified, based on their
    leaf anatomy, cell appearance, and element levels. Only cells that were clearly
    identifiable and had a flat surface were analysed, with airspaces, for example,
    avoided (Figure S1d,e). Because the central vacuole occupies most of the volume
    in a plant cell, it is assumed that the reported measurements typically reflect
    vacuolar concentrations. Different species possess different anatomy and combinations
    of cell types (Table S3; Figures S2-S6). Overall, the following six cell types
    were confidently identified and analysed: epidermis (EP), hypodermis (HY), palisade
    mesophyll (PM), spongy mesophyll (SM), internal parenchyma (IP), and sclerenchyma
    (SC). In some species, some of these cell types accumulated Ca differentially,
    with Ca not in all cells. In such cases, these were further subdivided, on the
    basis of their [Ca]. Calcium- accumulating cells were identified with the suffix
    Ca for example, HY.Ca, PM.Ca, SM.Ca, and IP.Ca. In total, 2,789 cells were analysed,
    with 7-117 cells analysed for each cell type within each species, across three
    individual plants (Table S3). The element maps for P are not presented because
    they did not pictorally reveal the distribution/variations in P, due to the consistently
    low levels of P; however, quantitation of [P] from regions of interest was still
    readily achievable (Figure S1f-h).'

  methods: 'Leaf samples for cell-specific element analysis were collected from the
    same plants and at the same time as for leaf nutrient analysis. From each individual
    plant,  only mature, undamaged, fully expanded, and sun-exposed leaves were sampled.
    Three samples were collected from up to two leaves, for each of the 21 individual
    plants. Upon removal of a leaf, small sections (~2 x 3 mm) were consistently cut
    from either side of the mid-rib, mid-way along the leaf, avoiding any large secondary
    veins. These sections were then mounted onto aluminium pins using optimal cutting
    temperature compound and plunged into liquid N (Figure S1a), thereby immediately
    immobilizing and preserving cellular ions. Samples were then stored in liquid
    N until preparation in a cryomicrotome and analysis using cryo-scanning electron
    microscopy. With this, all samples were collected fresh in the field, were immediately
    plunge frozen in liquid N, and were always kept under cryo-conditions, such that
    all elements were preserved in situ. Transverse regions of frozen hydrated leaf
    samples were prepared by cryoplaning a flat surface with a glass knife, followed
    by a diamond knife, at -120 deg C in a cryomicrotome (Leica EM FC6 cryochamber
    integrated with Leica Ultracut EM UC6 microtome). Leaves were progressively microtomed
    flat, initially on a glass knife at 1 um, 750 nm, and 500 nm steps and then finally
    with fine precision on a diamond knife at 250 and 100 nm steps. The pin was then
    mounted on a custom-made substage, transferred under an N gas environment to a
    Leica MED020 cryopreparation system, and sputter coated with 25-50 nm chromium,
    without sublimation. After coating, samples were transferred under vacuum to a
    Zeiss field emission scanning electron microscope fitted with a Leica VCT100 cryotransfer
    and stage, and an Oxford X-Max80 SDD X-ray detector interfaced to Oxford Instruments
    AZtecEnergy software (Figure S1b). This preparation method and this fully integrated
    Oxford analytical system have been shown to be highly suitable for elemental analysis
    and quantitation of biological samples (Huang, Canny, Oates, & McCully, 1994;
    Jin et al., 2017; Marshall, 2017; Marshall & Clode, 2009; Marshall, Goodyear,
    & Crewther, 2012; Marshall & Xu, 1998; McCully, Canny, Huang, Miller, & Brink,
    2010). Samples were analysed at -150  deg C, 15 kV, and a 2 nA beam current (measured
    using a faraday cup), in high-current mode. Prior to each map acquisition, the
    instrument was calibrated, and the beam current was measured using a pure copper
    standard. Elemental maps were acquired at a resolution of 512 pixels, for >3,000
    frames with a dwell time of 10 micro seconds per pixel. Drift correction and pulse-pile
    up correction were activated. Using the Oxford Instruments AZtecEnergy software,
    quantitative numerical data were subsequently extracted from regions of interest
    drawn on the element maps (Figure S1c), with individual spectra from each pixel
    within the region of interest summed and processed to yield element concentration
