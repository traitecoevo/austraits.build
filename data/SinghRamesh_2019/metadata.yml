  description: The data is part of a study focusing on leaf traits of tropical mountaintop
    restricted tree species and is associated with a larger collaborative research
    project led by the Tropical Mountaintop Plant Science (TrOMPS) team, Australian
    Tropical Herbarium.
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: Healthy sun-exposed branches of co-occurring mountaintop restricted
    tree species were targeted. Branches were excised using a sling-shot and or a
    pole pruner for accessible branches. Fresh leaves were transported to laboratory
    in storage bags, moistened with damp tissues. Leaves were weighed to obtain fresh
    mass and oven dried for about 42-78 h at 60℃ and their oven-dried mass were calculated.
