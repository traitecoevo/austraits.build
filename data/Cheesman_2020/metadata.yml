  description: Study to determine how isotopic, micro- and macro-morphological traits,
    in combination, reflect canopy position of leaves within a modern closed canopy
    forest, with the goal of understanding how these data could be applied to the
    fossil record.

  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: All leaf samples were obtained from the Daintree Rainforest Observatory
    (DRO), located in Cape Tribulation (-16.117 N, 145.45 E), 140 kilometres north
    of Cairns in Far North Queensland, Australia. The DRO, administered by James Cook
    University, includes two 1 ha permanent tree-census plots. One of these plots
    can be accessed by a 48.5 m high canopy-access crane (Leibherr Model 91EC, Adelaide,
    Australia). Forest at the DRO is described as a complex mesophyll vine forest
    Type 1a (Tracey, 1982) with a tall but irregular canopy varying in height from
    25 to 33 m with indistinct stratification of the subcanopy. Within the crane plot
    there are 85 different canopy tree species (comprising 60 genera, and 35 families)
    representing a basal area of ~33 m2 ha-1 (Tng et al., 2016). The Daintree Rainforest
    is considered one of the oldest continuously-vegetated tropical systems on earth
    and while not as speciose as some tropical closed forest systems, it represents
    a broad phylogenetic diversity, with many Gondwana 'relic' species (Costion et
    al., 2015). Initial leaf samples for canopy-understory comparisons were collected
    in 2014 from 89 species of plant found within the closed forest canopy of the
    DRO. This included both monocotyledonouos (7), dicotyledonous (81) and one cycad
    species Bowenia spectabilis (see Dryad Data Repository https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.3ffbg79ff).
    A range of growth forms have been sampled including trees and shrubs (collectively
    referred to here as trees) and lianas. Samples were collected from both the upper
    canopy crown (using the canopy access crane) and the understory ~ 0.4 to 1.5m,
    with an attempt made to collect the same species from both environments. During
    this initial sampling, in-situ leaf physiological measurements (e.g. light saturated
    photosynthesis (Asat), and responses to [CO2] (A-Ci) , and irradiance (A-I) curves)
    were made on at least two leaves of 71 species collected, using a Licor 6400 Portable
    Photosynthesis machine (LI-COR, Lincoln, NE, USA). In all upper canopy samples,
    12 leaves were harvested with nine analysed for basic leaf functional traits and
    three leaves frozen for later micro-morphological analysis. In the case of understory
    samples only the two leaves used for physiological measurements were harvested
    and analysed for leaf functional traits given typically limiting leaf material.
    In 2017, additional leaves were sampled across the light gradient continuum found
    in the forest canopy. Five species (Argyrodendron peralatum, Myristica globosa
    ssp. muelleri, Endiandra microneura, Cleistanthus myrianthus and Rockinghamia
    angustifolia) were harvested due to their prevalence at all forest strata of the
    study site. Leaves were sampled from the upper crown, interior crown (i.e. partial
    cover by surrounding vegetation), the understory as well as from within a significant
    tree fall gap. At each location six leaves have been harvested, with three analysed
    for basic leaf functional traits as above and the remainder archived for micromorphological
    analysis. At each sampling location, leaf area index (LAI) was determined using
    a LAI-2200C Plant Canopy Analyzer (LI-COR, Lincoln, NE, USA). In addition, and
    to examine the impact of environmental stress upon the fidelity of leaf traits,
    parallel upper and interior canopy samples were also collected from individuals
    impacted by a long-term (3-y) throughfall exclusion, or 'drought', experiment
    being conducted within the DRO crane plot (Tng et al., 2018). The throughfall
    exclusion plot (0.4 ha), wherein rainfall/thoughfall is intercepted and diverted
    off the plot has resulted in an area of elevated water stress within the crane
    accessible arc that includes replicated individuals of species found under natural
    conditions.

  methods: undulation index; Parallel canopy and understory leaves of 15 dicotyledonous
    species collected in 2014, as well as all samples collected in 2017 were shipped
    frozen to the University of Adelaide for clearing, staining and determination
    of epidermal cell area and undulation index. Subsections (38.5 mm2) from each
    of 3 leaves per sample were cleared using a 2:1 solution of 35% hydrogen peroxide
    (v/v) and 80% ethanol (v/v) at 75 deg C; cuticles have been stained with crystal
    violet (0.05% w/v), before mounting in glycerine jelly. Dilute concentrations
    of hydrogen peroxide failed to yield adequate cuticle material for multiple samples,
    predominantly of the species Argyrodendron peralatum, Cleistanthus myrianthus
    and Myristica globosa ssp. Muelleri. These samples were placed in a clearing solution
    of 20% chromic acid for a minimum of 24 hours but were not dyed, as chromic acid
    adequately stained cell structures. A UC50 camera (Olympus, Melbourne, VIC, Australia)
    mounted on an AX70 microscope (Olympus, Melbourne, VIC, Australia) with AnalySIS
    software (Soft Imaging System, Muenster, Germany) has been used to take three
    photographs per sample of the abaxial epidermis under 40x magnification. From
    each leaf, 15 cells have been traced using a HP Pavilion 15 touchscreen and stylus
    and analysed for cell area and perimeter using ImageJ. Each sample measurement
    is therefore calculated from an average of 45 cells. The measure of undulation
    index, a comparative measure of the perimeter of a cell compared to the perimeter
    of a circle with the same area, has been calculated following (Kuerschner, 1997).
