  description: For this study we monitored leaf water potentials, hydraulic conductivity,
    Lx and leaf area of terminal branches of E. tetrodonta saplings during two dry
    seasons. E. miniata saplings were included for comparison, and survival of tagged
    leaves and branches was also recorded. Relationships between Lx and water potential
    were compared for intact field-dried and excised laboratory-dried E. tetrodonta
    branches.
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: juvenile
  sampling_strategy: In 1998, shoot growth and survival of shoots, terminal branches
    and leaves was compared in E. tetrodonta and E.miniata saplings between 1 and
    3 m high. We use the term 'shoot' to refer to the above-ground part of a sapling.
    Forty saplings (32 at Palmerston and eight at Berrimah) of each species were tagged.
    Sapling height and diameter of the main stem at 1.0 m height were measured in
    May (start of dry season) and October (end of dry season). Numbers of original
    and new leaves on three tagged terminal branches per sapling were recorded monthly
    between May and October. One terminal branch was sampled from each of eight E.tetrodonta
    saplings in May, July and September 1996 for determination of hydraulic conductance/conductivity
    and loss of conductance due to xylem embolism. A different set of saplings was
    used each month. In 1998, terminal branches were sampled from E. tetrodonta and
    E.miniata saplings in May, June, July, August and September. Two saplings of each
    species were chosen from the Berrimah site, and six from the Palmerston site.
    Branches were collected before 0900 h, to avoid the time of day when water stress
    was most severe.

  methods: Huber values were calculated as the branch transverse area per leaf area,
    with leaf area being determined at the time of sampling. This will over estimate
    the Huber value if significant leaf loss had occurred prior to sampling, but the
    data we present are from May 1998, when minimal leaf loss had occurred. The diameter
    of the basal end of the branch was measured with callipers, and the length from
    cut end to tip measured with a ruler. Leaf area distal to the cut end was measured
    with a leaf area meter (Delta-T Devices Ltd, Cambridge, UK).

  methods: Hydraulic conductance (g s-1 MPa-1) was calculated as the slope of the relationship
    between flow rate and pressure difference using linear regression (SigmaPlot 4,
    Jandel Scientific, California, USA). The vacuum chamber was constructed from PVC
    pipe and was 1.05 m long, 160mm in diameter and could accommodate two branches.
    The solution was pulled through the branch in the same direction as the normal
    transpiration stream by applying a vacuum to the chamber with a vacuum pump. Flow
    rate was measured at four levels of vacuum (pressure difference,DP,=20, 30, 40
    and 50 kPa), measured with a vacuum gauge (Leybold, Germany). Generally 10-30
    mins were required to reliably establish flow rates at each pressure difference.

    on the basis of leaf area or transverse area of the branch at the proximal end
    of the cut (g s-1 MPa-1m-2). Leaf area distal to the cut end was measured with
    a leaf area meter (Delta-T Devices Ltd, Cambridge, UK).

  methods: The method for measuring hydraulic conductance of terminal branches was
    based on that described by Kolb et al.(1996) and Williams et al. (1997a). Hydraulic
    conductance (g s-1 MPa-1) was calculated as the slope of the relationship between
    flow rate and pressure difference using linear regression (SigmaPlot 4, Jandel
    Scientific, California, USA). Hydraulic conductance was also expressed on the
    basis of leaf area or transverse area of the branch at the proximal end of the
    cut (g s-1MPa-1m-2). The diameter of the basal end of the branch was measured
    with callipers, and the length from cut end to tip measured with a ruler.
