  description: By grouping species with similar water-use strategies into 'hydraulic
    functional types' (HFTs), we investigated the characteristics of water use in
    species-rich plant communities of south-western Australia.
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: In total, 21 prominent species were selected from across these
    three contrasting community types (heath, mallee, woodland) to incorporate some
    of the diversity of leaf types, taxa and growth habits within each community.
    These three sites represent different positions along the catenary sequence and
    soil depth, and water-storage capacity increases down the slope. All species selected
    are evergreen and retain leaves for at least 2 years (personal observation). Traits
    used in this study were chosen to construct an orthogonal species-trait matrix.
    In total, there were 16 traits used in the multivariate analyses.

  notes: In the data file provides KS & KL are identical. The KL values seem far off
    and are being ignored at this point. The values for leaf mass per area (inverse
    of SLA) are the largest in AusTraits; these are being retained as these are all
    thick-leaved species and the values match those in the manuscript.

  methods: Leaf physiological parameters related to turgor maintenance, namely osmotic
    potential (Psi-P100) and maximum bulk modulus of elasticity (Emax) during spring
    and summer, were taken from related work involving 20 of the 21 species (Mitchell
    et al. 2008). Pressure-volume analyses were performed on leafy twigs in September
    2004 and February-March 2005 collected between 0400 and 0700 hours. Four or five
    leaf or leafy twig samples per species were rehydrated and transported to the
    laboratory, and curves were generated using the bench-drying technique (Turner
    1988). The two leaf physiological parameters included in this study represent
    the seasonal shifts in these traits calculated using the difference in summer
    and spring values, and denoted by delta-psi-P100 and delta-Emax.

  unit_in: 10^5.kg/m/MPa/s
  trait_name: .na
  entity_type: population
  value_type: mean
  basis_of_value: measurement
  replicates: 6-8
  methods: All stems for hydraulic conductivity measurements were collected in the
    field between 0400 and 0700 hours to minimise the effect of diurnal changes in
    hydraulic conductivity (K). Six to eight stems per species were sampled during
    September 2004 and March 2005. Twig samples were collected from different individuals
    during each season to minimise the impact of the sampling on the small plants
    of many of the species. Large leafy branches were cut (distal to the leaves) and
    bagged in large plastic bags containing moist paper towels, sealed and re-bagged,
    transported to the laboratory and stored at 4ºC. At the time of measurement of
    K, stems were re-cut under water at a length approximately two times greater than
    the maximum vessel length (0.2-0.8 m), and stem widths varying from 3 to 10 mm.
    The apparatus for measuring hydraulic conductivity was similar to that described
    by Sperry et al. (1988). (See paper for more details). Leaf area was also measured
    on leaves above the proximal end of the stem segments for determination of leaf-specific
    hydraulic conductivity (KL).

  unit_in: mm
  trait_name: stem_vessel_diameter_hydraulic
  entity_type: population
  value_type: mean
  basis_of_value: measurement
  replicates: 6-8
  methods: All stem samples of the 21 species used in hydraulic conductivity measurements
    were used for measurement of conduit diameter. Two transverse sections at both
    ends of these stem sections were made using a hand microtome at 20- to 30-um thickness.
    Intact stem sections were then stained with basic fuchsin, rinsed and transferred
    to slides for microscopy. Digital images of sapwood material were made using a
    compound light microscope and digital camera at 50x (Carl Zeiss Inc., NY, USA).
    Diameters of conduits were measured using imaging software (Image J, 1.32 J, USA
    Institutes of National Health), by first creating threshold values from the black
    and white images and then analysing average diameter for all conduits within the
    sapwood. Hydraulically weighted mean conduit diameter was calculated on each sapwood
    segment (n > 100 conduits), and a grand mean was determined for each species to
    determine the relative contribution of the conduit to hydraulic conductivity.
    This calculation is based on the Hagen-Poiseuille relationship, whereby a conduit's
    contribution to the hydraulic conductivity is proportional to the fourth power
    of its diameter (d).

    hydraulic conductivity (K). Six to eight stems per species were sampled during
    September 2004 and March 2005. Twig samples were collected from different individuals
    during each season to minimise the impact of the sampling on the small plants
    of many of the species. Large leafy branches were cut (distal to the leaves) and
    bagged in large plastic bags containing moist paper towels, sealed and re-bagged,
    transported to the laboratory and stored at 4C. At the time of measurement of
    K, stems were re-cut under water at a length approximately two times greater than
    the maximum vessel length (0.2-0.8 m), and stem widths varying from 3 to 10 mm.
    The apparatus for measuring hydraulic conductivity was similar to that described
    by Sperry et al. (1988). (See paper for more details). Stem cross-sectional area
    at the distal end of the stem was used to calculate stemspecific K or KS (kg m-1
    s-1 MPa-1). The diameter of pith regions in the stem was measured and the total
    pith area (ranged from 3 to 10% of total stem cross-sectional area) was subtracted
    from the total cross-sectional areas of the stem.
- var_in: density
  unit_in: g/cm3
  trait_name: wood_density
  entity_type: population
  value_type: mean
  basis_of_value: measurement
  replicates: '6'
  methods: Small 2- to 3-year-old stem material (~3 to 6-mm diameter) was sampled
    from six individuals per species in December 2004. Stem segments of ~40 mm were
    cut and the periderm removed and immediately transferred to vials in a portable
    refrigerator to prevent dehydration. We estimated that the pith region in the
    stem segments used for density measurements represented less than 5% of the total
    stem cross-sectional area. Fresh wood volume (Vf) of these segments was measured
    using the Archimedes principle. Stem segments were attached to a needle tip supported
    by a clamp on a retort stand and then lowered into a beaker of water of known
    mass on a balance (0.0001 g resolution). Each segment was immersed just below
    the water surface and fresh wood volume measured as weight increase owing to the
    weight of water displaced by the sample. The stem segment was then air dried in
    an oven at 70C for a minimum of 4 days, then weighed to determine the dry weight
    (Wd). Basic density (Dstem) of the stem segment was calculated by dividing Wd
    by Vf.

  methods: Six mature leaves were also collected from each species to measure specific
    leaf area (SLA; m2 kg-1). They were scanned using a Licor 6100 (Licor Instruments,
    Lincoln, NE, USA) to determine leaf area and then placed in an oven at 70degrees
    C for 48 hours to determine dry mass. SLA was calculated by dividing the leaf
    area by the leaf dry mass.

  unit_in: '{delta}[ppth]'
  trait_name: leaf_delta13C
  entity_type: population
  value_type: mean
  basis_of_value: measurement
  replicates: 3-5
  methods: Three leaves from the same individuals sampled for leaf water potential
    during the month of January were collected for determination of carbon-isotope
    composition (d13C). Leaves from the previous year's cohort were collected to obtain
    material more than 12 months old. Leaves were oven dried and ground before being
    weighed into tin caps on a five-decimal balance before analysis. Carbon isotope
    composition was analysed using a VG SIRA 9 mass spectrometer (Middlewich, UK)
    and d13C was calculated using the formula from Farquhar et al. (1982) (see paper
    for equation).
- var_in: stem:root
  unit_in: mm/mm
  trait_name: .na.character
  entity_type: population
  value_type: mean
  basis_of_value: measurement
  replicates: 3-4
  methods: Root:stem cross-sectional areas were used as an indicator of allocation
    strategy between stems and roots. Root and stem diameters were measured using
    digital callipers at 0.1 m from the root junction or lignotuber or above the soil
    surface (for stems) to avoid large increases in root diameters near the root junction.
    Three to four individuals per species were excavated using a supersonic air spade
    (Series 2000, Concept Engineering Group Inc, Verona, PA, USA) that consists of
    a wand and nozzle that funnels high-pressure air (generated by a compressor) onto
    the soil, removing soil and fine roots (>5 mm) around the plant. Root systems
    were excavated to depths of 0.8 m, although at the heath and woodland sites excavations
    were often shallower due to the presence of impenetrable, fused laterite or heavy
    clay.
- var_in: WP-TLP (MPa)
  unit_in: MPa
  trait_name: leaf_turgor_loss_point
  entity_type: population
  value_type: mean
  basis_of_value: measurement
  replicates: 4-5
  methods: Pressure-volume curves were generated for four to five individuals per
    species during the spring and summer sampling periods using the bench drying technique
    (Turner 1988). Leaves or distal leafy twigs were sampled between 0400 and 0700
    h, and placed directly into vials with petioles or stems in deionized water, and
    then stored in an insulated box (non-refrigerated) for transport back to the laboratory
    (approximately 4 h). Previous experimentation with these species indicated that
    3-6 h was sufficient for rehydration of leaf tissue. Analysis of the moisture-release
    curves in each sample showed very little plateau effect (or super-rehydration)
    using this hydration period; the few samples that displayed this phenomenon were
    corrected for this effect according to Dichio et al. (2003). Stems or petioles
    were recut under water in the laboratory, and blotted dry, weighed and promptly
    pressurized using the pressure chamber (PMS Instrument) for determination of leaf
    water potential. Initial balancing pressures for both sampling times varied between
    0.05 and 0.3 MPa. Leaves or twigs were allowed to dry on the bench before repeating
    this procedure to generate a sufficient number of data points for the pressure-volume
    analysis. In general, this required at least three to five measurements in the
    linear portion of the pressure-volume isotherm, and at least four points before
    the turgor-loss point had been reached. Leaves were then placed in an oven at
    70 °C for 48 h and reweighed to determine dry weight and calculate relative water
    content (RWC). Saturated leaf water content was determined by regressing a straight
    line through the pre-turgor-loss points on a plot of fresh weight versus psileaf.
    ^p The tissue water relations parameters for the 20 species were determined from
    plots of -1/psi versus RWC. A pressure-volume curve-fitting routine (Microsoft
    Excel 2000; K. Tu, University of California Berkeley) based on the template of
    Schulte & Hinckley (1985) was used to generate key water relation parameters.
    The turgor-loss point was calculated by determining the regression coefficient
    for the last three points on the isotherm, and adding previous points on the graph
    until the regression coefficient was maximal, using a least-square analysis. This
    permitted calculation of osmotic potential at full turgor (psi 100, MPa) by extending
    the regression line back to the -1/psi axis; relative water content at turgor-loss
    point (RWCTLP) and leaf water potential at turgor-loss point (psiTLP, MPa) (Turner
    1988). Turgor pressures across the observed range of 1-RWC were estimated from
    the difference between values of psileaf on the linear region and the corresponding
    value of psileaf on the non-linear curve of the fitted data on the 1/psi versus
    1-RWC plot. Bulk modulus of elasticity (e, MPa) was estimated from the slope of
    the linear regression of turgor potential and symplastic relative water content
    (Rs) values over the full range of positive turgor pressures (Tyree & Jarvis 1982)
    (see manuscript for equation).The maximum value of e across the observed values
    of 1-RWC was taken as emax. Values for summer psileaf in some species were below
    the psiTLP generated by the pressure-volume analysis. This would imply that these
    leaves had zero or negative turgor at this time. These data suggest that either
    the loss of turgor was reversible when leaves become hydrated again in winter
    or the pressure-volume analyses underestimated psiTLP. Underestimation of psiTLP
    may have been caused by sampling leafy twigs with multiple-age leaf cohorts or
    changes to leaf tissue solutes during rehydration. Nevertheless, psiTLP data were
    within the range reported in the literature for other sclerophyllous vegetation.

    were recut under water in the laboratory, and blotted dry, weighed and promptly
    pressurized using the pressure chamber (PMS Instrument) for determination of leaf
    water potential. Initial balancing pressures for both sampling times varied between
    0.05 and 0.3 MPa. Leaves or twigs were allowed to dry on the bench before repeating
    this procedure to generate a sufficient number of data points for the pressure-volume
    analysis. In general, this required at least three to five measurements in the
    linear portion of the pressure-volume isotherm, and at least four points before
    the turgor-loss point had been reached. Leaves were then placed in an oven at
    70 °C for 48 h and reweighed to determine dry weight and calculate relative water
    content (RWC). Saturated leaf water content was determined by regressing a straight
    line through the pre-turgor-loss points on a plot of fresh weight versus psileaf.
    ^p The tissue water relations parameters for the 20 species were determined from
    plots of -1/psi versus RWC. A pressure-volume curve-fitting routine (Microsoft
    Excel 2000; K. Tu, University of California Berkeley) based on the template of
    Schulte & Hinckley (1985) was used to generate key water relation parameters.
    The turgor-loss point was calculated by determining the regression coefficient
    for the last three points on the isotherm, and adding previous points on the graph
    until the regression coefficient was maximal, using a least-square analysis. This
    permitted calculation of osmotic potential at full turgor (psi 100, MPa) by extending
    the regression line back to the -1/psi axis; relative water content at turgor-loss
    point (RWCTLP) and leaf water potential at turgor-loss point (psiTLP, MPa) (Turner
    1988). Turgor pressures across the observed range of 1-RWC were estimated from
    the difference between values of psileaf on the linear region and the corresponding
    value of psileaf on the non-linear curve of the fitted data on the 1/psi versus
    1-RWC plot. Bulk modulus of elasticity (e, MPa) was estimated from the slope of
    the linear regression of turgor potential and symplastic relative water content
    (Rs) values over the full range of positive turgor pressures (Tyree & Jarvis 1982)
    (see manuscript for equation).The maximum value of e across the observed values
    of 1-RWC was taken as emax. Values for summer psileaf in some species were below
    the psiTLP generated by the pressure-volume analysis. This would imply that these
    leaves had zero or negative turgor at this time. These data suggest that either
    the loss of turgor was reversible when leaves become hydrated again in winter
    or the pressure-volume analyses underestimated psiTLP. Underestimation of psiTLP
    may have been caused by sampling leafy twigs with multiple-age leaf cohorts or
    changes to leaf tissue solutes during rehydration. Nevertheless, psiTLP data were
    within the range reported in the literature for other sclerophyllous vegetation.
