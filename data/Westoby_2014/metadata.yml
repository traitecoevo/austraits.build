  description: field campaigns of Sean Gleason, Don Butler and Chris Blackman in eastern
    Australia
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: Sites were chosen in three bands of latitude (c. 18, 33 and 43_S)
    and correspondingly experienced a wide range of temperature (MAT 10.0-26.9 C)
    (Table S1, Fig. S2, Supporting information). Within each latitude, two or three
    sites of contrasting aridity (precipitation / potential evapotranspiration) were
    selected for study. At each latitude, a 'Wet' site was selected where rainfall
    was nearly equal to potential evapotranspiration. 'Dry' and 'Arid' sites were
    placed where rainfall was about 60% and 35% of potential evapotranspiration, respectively
    (Table S1, supporting information). An arid climate by this definition was not
    available at the highest latitude (Tasmania). Average leaf-area index (LAI) values
    for each site (1 km2 resolution) were calculated from 8-day values downloaded
    from MODIS (2011) for the periods between December 2008 and February 2009.  Sites
    represented late successional vegetation on soils considered oligotrophic based
    on parent material, vegetation type and soil survey data, where available. Within
    each site, the most common woody angiosperms present (15-18 species per site,
    excluding vines) were chosen for analysis (Table S2, supporting information).
    Of the 120 species present across all sites, twelve species were encountered at
    more than one site. Thus, differences between sites mainly reflect intrinsic differences
    between species, but differences within species occurring across sites can also
    be assessed to some extent. Including or excluding these 12 species did not change
    the outcomes of our hypothesis tests. Surface soils were collected for nutrient
    analysis (total N, total P, organic C, cation exchange characteristics and pH)
    (Table S1, supporting information). Soil profiles to a depth of 1.5 m (where possible)
    were described, noting colour, texture, structure, redoximorphic features and
    root characteristics.  Fieldwork was scheduled during the growth season at each
    site, but the heights of the tropical dry (c. July-August) and wet (January-March)
    seasons were avoided. This provided trait data corresponding to favourable times
    of the year, rather than seasonal extremes, with the exception of the hot-wet
    site, which was comparatively dry when sampled. We suspect that marginally low
    hydraulic conductance and CO2 assimilation rates at the hot-wet site resulted
    from these dry conditions. Trait collection times are as follows- September 2009
    (hot-wet), November 2009 (hot-dry), May 2010 (hot-arid), October 2010 (warm-wet),
    June 2009 (warm-dry), April 2009 (warm-arid), January 2010 (cool-wet) and March
    2010 (cool-dry). PLANT SELECTION, REPLICATION AND THE RATIO OF LEAF AREA TO XYLEM
    AREA  Except where noted, all plant traits were measured on five individuals  of
    each species within each site. Replicates representative of a species'  height
    and vigour were selected when possible. For species >5 m in height, smaller plants
    (c. 5 m) were chosen to facilitate collecting. To evaluate the effect of choosing
    small individuals on our hypothesis tests, analyses were conducted with a complete
    data set  (120 species), but also using a reduced data set (65 species), containing
    only species <5 m in height, for which trait data reflect maximum species size
    (Table S3, supporting information). We report only results from the full data
    set here because the reduced data set yielded similar results.'

  methods: Wood density was measured on segments 3-5 cm long for each twig sample.
    Bark and pith were removed and measurements were carried out on xylem only. In
    this paper we refer to xylem as 'wood'. After removing bark and pith, wood pieces
    were soaked in water for at least 48 h prior to volume measurement. Then a beaker
    filled with water was placed on a balance (0.0001 g, Mettler AE 160). A thin wire
    platform was suspended in water so that it did not touch the side or bottom of
    the beaker. The balance was tared before each measurement and a sample was gently
    placed on the platform. The mass of displaced water was read from the balance.
    From standard water density of 1 g cm-3 and knowing the mass of displaced water,
    we calculated sample volumes applying Archimedes' buoyancy principle (e.g. 1 g
    of displaced water equals 1 cm3 volume). Samples were then placed in paper envelopes
    and dried at 70  deg C for at least 72 h. Wood density was calculated as the dry
    mass divided by water saturated volume (g cm-3). These are values not collected
    by Kasia Zieminska. There are species for which wood density is not provided,
    as these values are included in the dataset Zieminska_2013.

    Bark and pith were removed and measurements were carried out on xylem only. In
    this paper we refer to xylem as 'wood'. After removing bark and pith, wood pieces
    were soaked in water for at least 48 h prior to volume measurement. Then a beaker
    filled with water was placed on a balance (0.0001 g, Mettler AE 160). A thin wire
    platform was suspended in water so that it did not touch the side or bottom of
    the beaker. The balance was tared before each measurement and a sample was gently
    placed on the platform. The mass of displaced water was read from the balance.
    From standard water density of 1 g cm-3 and knowing the mass of displaced water,
    we calculated sample volumes applying Archimedes' buoyancy principle (e.g. 1 g
    of displaced water equals 1 cm3 volume). Samples were then placed in paper envelopes
    and dried at 70  deg C for at least 72 h. Wood density was calculated as the dry
    mass divided by water saturated volume (g cm-3). These are values not collected
    by Kasia Zieminska. There are species for which wood density is not provided,
    as these values are included in the dataset Zieminska_2013.

  methods: Shoots 120 cm in length were cut from individuals as previously described.
    Large side branches were cut c. 10 cm from the main stem (in air), immediately
    placed in sealed heavy plastic bags and transported to the laboratory within 4
    days of collection. Shoots were then rehydrated by submerging the entire shoot
    in water for 24 h. All remaining side branches were removed (in air) and blotted
    dry with a paper towel, and the exposed xylem was sealed (Loctite 550 adhesive,
    779 activator; Henkel, Kilsyth, Australia). The distal diameter and total length
    were trimmed to 0.5 mm and 80 cm, respectively. Branch conductivity was measured
    in the distal-to-proximal direction (Mitchell et al. 2008) using a Sperry apparatus
    (Sperry, Donnelly & Tyree 1988) after trimming both ends under water. We measured
    Kh in the distal-to-proximal direction to reduce flow through the regions of xylem
    associated with the sealed side branches. However, it is likely that the direction
    of flow has little or no effect on Kh (John Sperry, personal communication).  Branch
    conductivity was measured across a 100-kPa pressure gradient using 0.02 M KCl
    (Zwieniecki, Melcher & Holbrook 2001) that had been filtered (0.2 um) and degassed
    under vacuum. Conductivity was measured at high pressure (100 kPa) to flush native
    emboli (Choat, Sack & Holbrook 2007) as well as emboli introduced during branch
    trimming. Pressure was provided using an N2 cylinder. Water was collected and
    weighed to the nearest 0.00001 g (Sartorius CP225D, Gottingen, Germany) and logged
    at 15-s intervals to calculate flow rate. To prevent contact between the N2 and
    the hydraulic solution (to avoid gassing the solution), the N2 was allowed to
    flow into a rigid polystyrene bottle that contained a flexible polypropylene bag
    inside it, which contained the hydraulic solution. As N2 flowed into the rigid
    bottle, 100 kPa of pressure was exerted on the polypropylene bag and pushed the
    hydraulic solution through the stem segment.  Steady-state flow rates were typically
    achieved after 10-20 min, although occasionally shoots required an hour or more
    to reach steady-state. After branch conductivity measurements, each segment was
    tested for open vessels by pressurizing the distal end (100 kPaN2) and recording
    whether bubbles were observed from the submerged proximal end. Although the majority
    of species had closed vessels during Kh measurement, 26 species did not. These
    species did not exhibit significantly higher branch conductivities than closed-vessel
    species (Fig. S3, supporting information), nor did excluding these species from
    our analysis change the outcomes of our results. Therefore, we report analyses
    that included all species. Xylem-specific conductivity was calculated by dividing
    branch conductivity by the distal cross-sectional area (xylem) of each segment,
    subtracting pith.

  methods: For the ratio of leaf area to xylem area, we measured xylem diameters (inside
    bark) along the main stem of vertical leading shoots at 5, 10, 20, 40, 80 and
    120 cm from the shoot tip. The inside-bark diameter (including all woody tissue
    beneath the cambium) at the distal and proximal ends were measured using digital
    callipers (precision = 0.1mm). Stems and leaves were separated, dried to constant
    mass at 70 deg C and weighed (precision = 0.0001 g). Ordinary least squares regression
    was then used to predict leaf mass as a function of inside-bark stem diameter.
    Leaf mass per unit area values (methods described elsewhere) were then used to
    convert dry leaf mass into green leaf area for any given inside-bark stem diameter.
    Ratio of leaf area to xylem area was calculated in this way for 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0
    cm xylem diameters, excluding pith. These three ratios of leaf of area to xylem
    area yielded similar results, and only values of ratio leaf area to xylem area
    at 1.0 cm xylem diameters are reported here.

    inspected in the field to determine the appropriate light intensity for Amax measurements.
    Measurements were taken between 08:00 and 11:30. Within-chamber CO2 concentration,

  methods: Blackman 2014; For each mainland Australian site leaf hydraulic vulnerability
    was measured in 11-16 of the most common co-occurring woody species. Leaf hydraulic
    vulnerability data for the Tasmanian and Peruvian species were sourced from previous
    work (Blackman et al., 2010, 2012). Vulnerability curves were generated for each
    species by measuring Kleaf at a range of water potentials (Cleaf ). Kleaf wasmeasured
    using amodified rehydration technique whereby leaves were allowed to rehydrate
    while connected to a flow meter (Brodribb and Cochard, 2009). Branches 1-2 m in
    length were cut from the upper canopies of three individuals of each species and
    immediately placed inside plastic bags for transport back to the laboratory. Most
    sampling was done early in the morning when plants were well hydrated. Cut branches
    were laid on the bench top and allowed to dehydrate slowly in approx. 1-MPa steps.
    At each 1-MPa step, the branch was carefully re-bagged to arrest water loss and
    ensure water potential equilibrium. After equilibration, two adjacent leaves or
    small shoot tips with fully expanded leaves were cut from each branch for determination
    of Cleaf (pressure chamber Model 1000, PMS Instruments, Corvallis, OR, USA). An
    adjacent sample shoot was then cut under water to prevent vessel cavitation and
    immediately connected via silicon tubing to a beaker of ultra-pure milli-Q water
    placed on a laboratory balance (Sartorius CP225D, Goettingen, Germany). A pressure
    release valve ensured zero pressure in the system upon connection of the shoot
    to the tubing. Water was then drawn into the rehydrating leaves out of the balance,
    which logged the change in mass every 2 s. The maximum rate of water flow was
    calculated from the first 3-4 data points at the very beginning of the rehydration
    (exponential decay) curve. This ratewas then normalized by leaf area, pressure
    gradient (i.e. leaf water potential) and water viscosity. For each species, normalized
    flowrates (Kleaf )weremaximal in shoots near full hydration (between -1 and -2
    MPa) and declined as shoots became progressively drier. Loss in Kleaf was plotted
    against initial leaf (xylem) water potential and fitted with an exponential sigmoidal
    equation (Pammenter and VanderWilligen, 1998).We assumed losses in hydraulic conductance
    in our sample group were primarily due to cavitation and the formation of embolisms
    in the water conducting xylem; however, we acknowledge that processes such as

  methods: Blackman 2014; For each mainland Australian site leaf hydraulic vulnerability
    was measured in 11-16 of the most common co-occurring woody species. Leaf hydraulic
    vulnerability data for the Tasmanian and Peruvian species were sourced from previous
    work (Blackman et al., 2010, 2012). Vulnerability curves were generated for each
    species by measuring Kleaf at a range of water potentials (Cleaf ). Kleaf wasmeasured
    using amodified rehydration technique whereby leaves were allowed to rehydrate
    while connected to a flow meter (Brodribb and Cochard, 2009). Branches 1-2 m in
    length were cut from the upper canopies of three individuals of each species and
    immediately placed inside plastic bags for transport back to the laboratory. Most
    sampling was done early in the morning when plants were well hydrated. Cut branches
    were laid on the bench top and allowed to dehydrate slowly in approx. 1-MPa steps.
    At each 1-MPa step, the branch was carefully re-bagged to arrest water loss and
    ensure water potential equilibrium. After equilibration, two adjacent leaves or
    small shoot tips with fully expanded leaves were cut from each branch for determination
    of Cleaf (pressure chamber Model 1000, PMS Instruments, Corvallis, OR, USA). An
    adjacent sample shoot was then cut under water to prevent vessel cavitation and
    immediately connected via silicon tubing to a beaker of ultra-pure milli-Q water
    placed on a laboratory balance (Sartorius CP225D, Goettingen, Germany). A pressure
    release valve ensured zero pressure in the system upon connection of the shoot
    to the tubing. Water was then drawn into the rehydrating leaves out of the balance,
    which logged the change in mass every 2 s. The maximum rate of water flow was
    calculated from the first 3-4 data points at the very beginning of the rehydration
    (exponential decay) curve. This ratewas then normalized by leaf area, pressure
    gradient (i.e. leaf water potential) and water viscosity. For each species, normalized
    flowrates (Kleaf )weremaximal in shoots near full hydration (between -1 and -2
    MPa) and declined as shoots became progressively drier. Loss in Kleaf was plotted
    against initial leaf (xylem) water potential and fitted with an exponential sigmoidal
    equation (Pammenter and VanderWilligen, 1998).We assumed losses in hydraulic conductance
    in our sample group were primarily due to cavitation and the formation of embolisms
    in the water conducting xylem; however, we acknowledge that processes such as
    turgor loss and leaf shrinkage may also act to drive changes in Kleaf (Scoffoni
    et al., 2014), especially in the small number of non-sclerophyllous species from
    moist sites. Embolism resistance was expressed as the water potential at which

  methods: Fully expanded sun-leaves were collected from three individuals from each
    field site at the time leaf hydraulic vulnerability measurements were made. Between
    five and ten sample leaves from each of three individuals per species were sealed
    in zip-lock bags with moist paper-towel and placed inside an insulated cool-box.
    Samples were transported back to the laboratory within 3 d of collecting and fixed
    in FAA (formalin acetic acid) solution and stored. Measurements of xylem anatomy
    in petioles, midribs, 2deg veins and minor veins were made in one leaf from two
    to three individuals per species, with the exception of vessels in 2deg veins
    of Pultenaea scabra which were calculated from a single leaf (see Table S1). Leaf
    area was measured using a flat-bed scanner (Scan Maker i900, Microtek International,
    China) before sectioning. Transverse sections of vein xylem were made using a
    vibratome (VT1000s, Leica Microsystems, Germany). Sections were made half-way
    along the length of the petiole, mid-rib and 2deg veins (minor vein anatomy was
    generally captured within lower order vein sections). Small (<deg1 cm2) pieces
    of leaf, each containing a target vein, were cut out and individually suspended
    in 6 % agarose blocks. Each agarose block was shaped with a razor-blade and then
    mounted onto the vibratome stage ensuring that the target vein was perpendicular
    to the cutting edge of the blade. Several transverse sections were cut at a thickness
    of between 10 and 20 um. Sections were stained in dilute 1 % methylene blue before
    mounting onto glass slides in phenol glycerine jelly. The xylem anatomy of each
    vein order was photographed using a digital camera (DXM1200F, Nikon, Japan) attached
    to a light microscope (Bx50, Olympus Optical, Japan). Magnification of each vein
    depended on vessel size; petioles, mid-ribs and 2 deg veins were photographed
    at 40x or 100x, while minor veins were photographed at 100x. From each image,
    lumen breadth (b) and wall thickness (t) was measured using ImageJ software (National
    Institutes of Health, USA) from a representative sample of between ten and 100
    hydraulically functional vessels. Due to the typically low number of vessels in
    minor veins, b and t were measured from two or three different minor veins per
    leaf. For all veins, care was taken to avoid cell-types such as fibre cells and
    xylem parenchyma that were deemed to provide functional roles beyond water transport.
    Also, minor veins were identified as the smallest veins in cross section with
    a clearly defined vascular bundle (xylem and phloem), and were carefully distinguished
    from free vein endings, which were often enlarged and represented sclereids and/or
    tracheids in some species. Because vessels were often elliptical in shape, b was
    measured along the short and long axes of each vessel, and then transformed to
    the circular equivalent diameter (Choat et al., 2007). Hydraulically weighted
    vessel diameter (bh) was calculated according to the formula bh = sum(b4/n)0.25,
    which weights the vessels (n) within each vein order by their hydraulic contribution
    to total vein conductance (Tyree and Zimmermann, 2002).

    at 40x or 100x, while minor veins were photographed at 100x. From each image,
    lumen breadth (b) and wall thickness (t) was measured using ImageJ software (National
    Institutes of Health, USA) from a representative sample of between ten and 100
    hydraulically functional vessels. Due to the typically low number of vessels in
    minor veins, b and t were measured from two or three different minor veins per
    leaf. For all veins, care was taken to avoid cell-types such as fibre cells and
    xylem parenchyma that were deemed to provide functional roles beyond water transport.
    Also, minor veins were identified as the smallest veins in cross section with
    a clearly defined vascular bundle (xylem and phloem), and were carefully distinguished
    from free vein endings, which were often enlarged and represented sclereids and/or
    tracheids in some species. Because vessels were often elliptical in shape, b was
    measured along the short and long axes of each vessel, and then transformed to
    the circular equivalent diameter (Choat et al., 2007). Hydraulically weighted
    vessel diameter (bh) was calculated according to the formula bh = sum(b4/n)0.25,
    which weights the vessels (n) within each vein order by their hydraulic contribution
    to total vein conductance (Tyree and Zimmermann, 2002).

  methods: Fully expanded sun-leaves were collected from three individuals from each
    field site at the time leaf hydraulic vulnerability measurements were made. Between
    five and ten sample leaves from each of three individuals per species were sealed
    in zip-lock bags with moist paper-towel and placed inside an insulated cool-box.
    Samples were transported back to the laboratory within 3 d of collecting and fixed
    in FAA (formalin acetic acid) solution and stored. Measurements of xylem anatomy
    in petioles, midribs, 2deg veins and minor veins were made in one leaf from two
    to three individuals per species, with the exception of vessels in 2deg veins
    of Pultenaea scabra which were calculated from a single leaf (see Table S1). Leaf
    area was measured using a flat-bed scanner (Scan Maker i900, Microtek International,
    China) before sectioning. Transverse sections of vein xylem were made using a
    vibratome (VT1000s, Leica Microsystems, Germany). Sections were made half-way
    along the length of the petiole, mid-rib and 2deg veins (minor vein anatomy was
    generally captured within lower order vein sections). Small (<deg1 cm2) pieces
    of leaf, each containing a target vein, were cut out and individually suspended
    in 6 % agarose blocks. Each agarose block was shaped with a razor-blade and then
    mounted onto the vibratome stage ensuring that the target vein was perpendicular
    to the cutting edge of the blade. Several transverse sections were cut at a thickness
    of between 10 and 20 um. Sections were stained in dilute 1 % methylene blue before
    mounting onto glass slides in phenol glycerine jelly. The xylem anatomy of each
    vein order was photographed using a digital camera (DXM1200F, Nikon, Japan) attached
    to a light microscope (Bx50, Olympus Optical, Japan). Magnification of each vein
    depended on vessel size; petioles, mid-ribs and 2 deg veins were photographed
    at 40x or 100x, while minor veins were photographed at 100x. From each image,
