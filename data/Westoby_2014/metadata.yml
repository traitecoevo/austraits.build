  description: field campaigns of Sean Gleason, Don Butler and Chris Blackman in eastern
    Australia
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: Sites were chosen in three bands of latitude (c. 18, 33 and 43_S)
    and correspondingly experienced a wide range of temperature (MAT 10.0<U+FFFD>26.9
    C) (Table S1, Fig. S2, Supporting information). Within each latitude, two or three
    sites of contrasting aridity (precipitation / potential evapotranspiration) were
    selected for study. At each latitude, a 'Wet' site was selected where rainfall
    was nearly equal to potential evapotranspiration. 'Dry' and 'Arid' sites were
    placed where rainfall was about 60% and 35% of potential evapotranspiration, respectively
    (Table S1, supporting information). An arid climate by this definition was not
    available at the highest latitude (Tasmania). Average leaf-area index (LAI) values
    for each site (1 km2 resolution) were calculated from 8-day values downloaded
    from MODIS (2011) for the periods between December 2008 and February 2009.  Sites
    represented late successional vegetation on soils considered oligotrophic based
    on parent material, vegetation type and soil survey data, where available. Within
    each site, the most common woody angiosperms present (15-18 species per site,
    excluding vines) were chosen for analysis (Table S2, supporting information).
    Of the 120 species present across all sites, twelve species were encountered at
    more than one site. Thus, differences between sites mainly reflect intrinsic differences
    between species, but differences within species occurring across sites can also
    be assessed to some extent. Including or excluding these 12 species did not change
    the outcomes of our hypothesis tests. Surface soils were collected for nutrient
    analysis (total N, total P, organic C, cation exchange characteristics and pH)
    (Table S1, supporting information). Soil profiles to a depth of 1.5 m (where possible)
    were described, noting colour, texture, structure, redoximorphic features and
    root characteristics.  Fieldwork was scheduled during the growth season at each
    site, but the heights of the tropical dry (c. July-August) and wet (January-March)
    seasons were avoided. This provided trait data corresponding to favourable times
    of the year, rather than seasonal extremes, with the exception of the hot-wet
    site, which was comparatively dry when sampled. We suspect that marginally low
    hydraulic conductance and CO2 assimilation rates at the hot-wet site resulted
    from these dry conditions. Trait collection times are as follows- September 2009
    (hot-wet), November 2009 (hot-dry), May 2010 (hot<U+FFFD>arid), October 2010 (warm-wet),
    June 2009 (warm-dry), April 2009 (warm-arid), January 2010 (cool-wet) and March
    2010 (cool-dry).  PLANT SELECTION, REPLICATION AND THE RATIO OF LEAF AREA TO XYLEM
    AREA  Except where noted, all plant traits were measured on five individuals  of
    each species within each site. Replicates representative of a species'  height
    and vigour were selected when possible. For species >5 m in height, smaller plants
    (c. 5 m) were chosen to facilitate collecting. To evaluate the effect of choosing
    small individuals on our hypothesis tests, analyses were conducted with a complete
    data set  (120 species), but also using a reduced data set (65 species), containing
    only species <5 m in height, for which trait data reflect maximum species size
    (Table S3, supporting information). We report only results from the full data
    set here because the reduced data set yielded similar results.'

  value_type: site_mean

  methods: The inside-bark diameter (including all woody tissue beneath the cambium)
    at the distal and proximal ends were measured using digital callipers (precision

- var_in: wood density (g/cm3)
  unit_in: mg/mm3
  trait_name: wood_density
  value_type: site_mean
  replicates: '5'
  methods: Wood density was measured on segments 3-5 cm long for each twig sample.
    Bark and pith were removed and measurements were carried out on xylem only. In
    this paper we refer to xylem as 'wood'. After removing bark and pith, wood pieces
    were soaked in water for at least 48 h prior to volume measurement. Then a beaker
    filled with water was placed on a balance (0.0001 g, Mettler AE 160). A thin wire
    platform was suspended in water so that it did not touch the side or bottom of
    the beaker. The balance was tared before each measurement and a sample was gently
    placed on the platform. The mass of displaced water was read from the balance.
    From standard water density of 1 g cm-3 and knowing the mass of displaced water,
    we calculated sample volumes applying Archimedes' buoyancy principle (e.g. 1 g
    of displaced water equals 1 cm3 volume). Samples were then placed in paper envelopes
    and dried at 70 degC for at least 72 h. Wood density was calculated as the dry mass
    divided by water saturated volume (g cm-3).

  unit_in: kg/m/s/MPa
  trait_name: sapwood_specific_conductivity
  value_type: site_mean
  replicates: '5'
  methods: Shoots 120 cm in length were cut from individuals as previously described.
    Large side branches were cut c. 10 cm from the main stem (in air), immediately
    placed in sealed heavy plastic bags and transported to the laboratory within 4
    days of collection. Shoots were then rehydrated by submerging the entire shoot
    in water for 24 h. All remaining side branches were removed (in air) and blotted
    dry with a paper towel, and the exposed xylem was sealed (Loctite 550 adhesive,
    779 activator; Henkel, Kilsyth, Australia). The distal diameter and total length
    were trimmed to 0.5 mm and 80 cm, respectively. Branch conductivity was measured
    in the distal-to-proximal direction (Mitchell et al. 2008) using a Sperry apparatus
    (Sperry, Donnelly & Tyree 1988) after trimming both ends under water. We measured
    Kh in the distal-to-proximal direction to reduce flow through the regions of xylem
    associated with the sealed side branches. However, it is likely that the direction
    of flow has little or no effect on Kh (John Sperry, personal communication).  Branch
    conductivity was measured across a 100-kPa pressure gradient using 0.02 M KCl
    (Zwieniecki, Melcher & Holbrook 2001) that had been filtered (0.2 um) and degassed
    under vacuum. Conductivity was measured at high pressure (100 kPa) to flush native
    emboli (Choat, Sack & Holbrook 2007) as well as emboli introduced during branch
    trimming. Pressure was provided using an N2 cylinder. Water was collected and
    weighed to the nearest 0.00001 g (Sartorius CP225D, Gottingen, Germany) and logged
    at 15-s intervals to calculate flow rate. To prevent contact between the N2 and
    the hydraulic solution (to avoid gassing the solution), the N2 was allowed to
    flow into a rigid polystyrene bottle that contained a flexible polypropylene bag
    inside it, which contained the hydraulic solution. As N2 flowed into the rigid
    bottle, 100 kPa of pressure was exerted on the polypropylene bag and pushed the
    hydraulic solution through the stem segment.  Steady-state flow rates were typically
    achieved after 10-20 min, although occasionally shoots required an hour or more
    to reach steady-state. After branch conductivity measurements, each segment was
    tested for open vessels by pressurizing the distal end (100 kPaN2) and recording
    whether bubbles were observed from the submerged proximal end. Although the majority
    of species had closed vessels during Kh measurement, 26 species did not. These
    species did not exhibit significantly higher branch conductivities than closed-vessel
    species (Fig. S3, supporting information), nor did excluding these species from
    our analysis change the outcomes of our results. Therefore, we report analyses
    that included all species. Xylem-specific conductivity was calculated by dividing
    branch conductivity by the distal cross-sectional area (xylem) of each segment,
    subtracting pith.

    779 activator; Henkel, Kilsyth, Australia). The distal diameter and total length
    were trimmed to 0.5 mm and 80 cm, respectively. Branch conductivity was measured
    in the distal-to-proximal direction (Mitchell et al. 2008) using a Sperry apparatus
    (Sperry, Donnelly & Tyree 1988) after trimming both ends under water. We measured
    Kh in the distal-to-proximal direction to reduce flow through the regions of xylem
    associated with the sealed side branches. However, it is likely that the direction
    of flow has little or no effect on Kh (John Sperry, personal communication).  Branch
    conductivity was measured across a 100-kPa pressure gradient using 0.02 M KCl
    (Zwieniecki, Melcher & Holbrook 2001) that had been filtered (0.2 um) and degassed
    under vacuum. Conductivity was measured at high pressure (100 kPa) to flush native
    emboli (Choat, Sack & Holbrook 2007) as well as emboli introduced during branch
    trimming. Pressure was provided using an N2 cylinder. Water was collected and
    weighed to the nearest 0.00001 g (Sartorius CP225D, Gottingen, Germany) and logged
    at 15-s intervals to calculate flow rate. To prevent contact between the N2 and
    the hydraulic solution (to avoid gassing the solution), the N2 was allowed to
    flow into a rigid polystyrene bottle that contained a flexible polypropylene bag
    inside it, which contained the hydraulic solution. As N2 flowed into the rigid
    bottle, 100 kPa of pressure was exerted on the polypropylene bag and pushed the
    hydraulic solution through the stem segment.  Steady-state flow rates were typically
    achieved after 10-20 min, although occasionally shoots required an hour or more
    to reach steady-state. After branch conductivity measurements, each segment was
    tested for open vessels by pressurizing the distal end (100 kPaN2) and recording
    whether bubbles were observed from the submerged proximal end. Although the majority
    of species had closed vessels during Kh measurement, 26 species did not. These
    species did not exhibit significantly higher branch conductivities than closed-vessel
    species (Fig. S3, supporting information), nor did excluding these species from
    our analysis change the outcomes of our results. Therefore, we report analyses
    that included all species. Xylem-specific conductivity was calculated by dividing
    branch conductivity by the distal cross-sectional area (xylem) of each segment,
    subtracting pith.

  unit_in: m2/m2
  trait_name: leaf_area_per_sapwood_area
  value_type: site_mean
  replicates: '5'
  methods: For the ratio of leaf area to xylem area, we measured xylem diameters (inside
    bark) along the main stem of vertical leading shoots at 5, 10, 20, 40, 80 and
    120 cm from the shoot tip. The inside-bark diameter (including all woody tissue
    beneath the cambium) at the distal and proximal ends were measured using digital
    callipers (precision = 0.1mm). Stems and leaves were separated, dried to constant
    mass at 70degC and weighed (precision = 0.0001 g). Ordinary least squares regression
    was then used to predict leaf mass as a function of inside-bark stem diameter.
    Leaf mass per unit area values (methods described elsewhere) were then used to
    convert dry leaf mass into green leaf area for any given inside-bark stem diameter.
    Ratio of leaf area to xylem area was calculated in this way for 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0
    cm xylem diameters, excluding pith. These three ratios of leaf of area to xylem
    area yielded similar results, and only values of ratio leaf area to xylem area
    at 1.0 cm xylem diameters are reported here.

  methods: Seven-step light response curves (PFD = 1500-0 lmol m-2 s-1) were constructed
    in situ for the first plant of each species at each site to determine the appropriate
    light saturation intensities at which to measure maximum assimilation (Amax) and
    transpiration (E) rates using a portable photosynthesis system (Model 6400xt;
    LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE, USA). Assimilation rates at each step were judged
    stable when varying less than c. 0.5 lmol m-2 s-1 for 5 min. Curves were visually
    inspected in the field to determine the appropriate light intensity for Amax measurements.
    Measurements were taken between 08:00 and 11:30. Within-chamber CO2 concentration,
    temperature and VPD were kept between 388 and 402 ppm, 23.0-27.0degC and 1.9-2.1
    kPa for all measurements. Although 2.0 kPaVPD results in reduced stomatal conductance,
    we note that CO2 assimilation is relatively flat between 0.4 and 2.0 kPa, even
    for rain forest plants (Cunningham 2004, 2005), and therefore, our across-species
    comparisons of Amax should remain relatively unbiased. We note that leaf transpiration
    rates of our wet forest species may have plateaued or even declined at 2 kPa VPD
    (Oren et al. 1999; Cunningham 2004) and should be interpreted with caution. Leaf
    mass per unit area (LMA) was calculated by dividing dry leaf mass by fresh leaf
    surface area.
