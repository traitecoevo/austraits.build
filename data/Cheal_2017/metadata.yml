  methods: Compilation from diverse sources and expert opinion; This trait includes
    the component of "PERSEED" (perennial seed) capturing whether or not germination
    is cued by fire. Options include, D, "wide dispersal", relevant to the usual/common/typical
    size of fire patches in that community; dispersal distance is greater than the
    usual size of fire patches plus the distance between patches; many animal or widely-wind
    dispersed species are included; Dispersal may be by wind or from fleshy fruit
    (birds disperse fruit widely); essentially this category means that there is no
    need for photosynthetic plants nor seeds to survive on a site for the species
    to (re-)appear after athe site has been burnt; S, "partial germination", when
    only a portion of the pre-fire seed bank germinates & some of that portion which
    does not germinate remains viable. Partial germination means that only some stored
    seed gets the germination cue, leaving some viable seed if there is another fire
    in quick succession or the first germination fails. 'Partial germination' is common
    for species which rely on a temperature cue (eg. legumes) as some seeds are too
    deeply buried to receive this cue.; Three subvisiions of "complete germination",
    where nearly all stored seed gets the germination cue and so the seed bank is
    exhausted straight afer fires; there is thus no viable seed bank until the first
    seed set. If germinants do not establish (eg. due to drought or a 2nd fire) local
    persistence of the species is problematic or even unlikely. 'Complete germimation'
    can be assumed for species whose germinbation cues are some exudate from ash or
    smoke, as rainfall infuses the cue thruout the (whole) soil profile; it can also
    be assumed for elevated seed banks. Among species with complete germination, G
    are "long-lived", typically > 10 years, and once there is a fire and germination
    occurs, seed is then unavailable until plants mature; C are "short-lived", typically
    < 2 years, with negligible (or only very short-term) on-site survival of seed
    after adults die. For these species, seed do not readily migrate into the site
    between fires. Finally, Z are species that do not re-establish from seed immediately
    (or soon) after fire. These are particularly a feature of rainforests and other
    EVCs that are very rarely burnt, may or many not resprout.

  trait_name: fire_and_establishing
  entity_type: species
  value_type: mode
  basis_of_value: expert_score
  replicates: .na
  methods: compilation from diverse sources and expert opinion; This trait captures
    how fire establishment patterns contribute to the species' age structure in the
    community; options are, T = can establish immediately after fire and in later
    years as vegetation ages, right thru to mature and over-mature vegetation (assuming
    suitable seasonal conditions). These species form multi-aged stands, recruitment
    can occur at any age but may not occur thruout the year (eg. annual plants may
    establish in 1-year old vegetation, 10-year old vegetation, 100-year old vegetation
    but not in dry summers); I = able to establish immediately after a fire (within
    the first 2 seasons, and usually within the first season), but cannot continue
    recruitment as the vegetation ages further, unable to establish in mature vegetation.
    These species Form single-aged stands or cohorts (within the area burnt by a single
    fire), often with some form of long-lived seed storage between fires; R = unable
    to establish immediately after fire (within the first season or two), but can
    establish in older vegetation (including mature to over-mature vegetation), requires
    some environmental charateristics not found in vegetation straight after fires.
    These species require some environmental characteristics not found in vegetation
    straight after fires (eg. closed canopies or dense/moist litter layers or dispersal
    from a distant refuge or faunal dispersal).; M = can only establish at an intermediate
    stage, ie. cannot establish straight after fire nor in mature to over-mature vegetation.
    These species require some time after fire before they can establish and also
    cannot establish when the vegetation has matured.  Different from 'I' in that
    dependent on fire for establishment, but cannot establish in the first few seasons
    after fire (eg. fire cues flowering but plant needs time to flower and set viable
    seed before seedlings can establish); a category that's difficult to assign with
    confidence.; K = establish immediately after fire and also in mature to over-mature
    vegetation, cannot establish in intermediate aged vegetation. This category includes
    long-lived species with a long time between seedling (or post-fire resprout stage)
    and reproductive maturity (mostly > 2 years), can establish in long-unburnt vegetation,
    but can also establish immediately after fire.

  trait_name: lifespan
  entity_type: species
  value_type: bin
  basis_of_value: expert_score
  replicates: .na
  methods: compilation from diverse sources and expert opinion; This trait captures
    time to local extinction of the species within the community.  Extinction occurs
    after above-ground plants have disappeared and viable seed is insufficient to
    replace typical pre-fire densities.  At this time it is expected that the species
    will not recover from another fire unless it has widely dispersed propagules.  Be
    careful not to confuse this with the lifespan of an individual plant within a
    species.
