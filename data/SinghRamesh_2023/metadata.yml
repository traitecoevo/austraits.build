  description: A glasshouse experiment investigating the effects of temperature, soil
    nutrient availability, and species on plant functional traits.
  basis_of_record: experiment
  life_stage: sapling
  sampling_strategy: We collected seeds from the four focal species, with each species
    collected at a single site (Supplementary Table 1). The four collection sites
    were distributed across most of the elevation range found in the Australian Wet
    Tropics (Lowland species, F. ifflana ~300 m and F. bourjotiana ~600 m, and Upland
    species F. brayleyana ~990 m and F. oppositifolia ~1,550 m). The seeds were allowed
    to germinate under ambient shade-house conditions at the Environmental Research
    Complex (ERC), (~30 m a.s.l.) JCU, Cairns, Australia. Healthy saplings were transplanted
    (approximately 3 months after sowing seeds) into either 13.5 L pots (Garden City
    Pots, Model P300ST00) containing nutrient-rich soil (NR), comprising a 1:1 mixture
    by volume of premium garden potting mix and compost (Northside Landscape Supplies
    Pty. Ltd., Trinity Beach); or 8.5 L pots (Garden City Pots, Model P250STTL) containing
    nutrient-poor soil (NP). The nutrientpoor soil comprised a locally collected dermasol,
    low in organic matter and supplemented with perlite and washed river sand to improve
    drainage (Supplementary Table 2). The two soil mixtures, nutrient-rich and nutrient-poor,
    had similar d15N at the start of the experiment, based on measurements of subsamples;
    these values were 5.4 and 5.3 parts-per-thousand, respectively.  ^p  The experimental pots were
    transferred into a climate-controlled glasshouse facility. The facility is divided
    into three temperaturecontrolled chambers, each with a shade screen (SOLARO, Ludvig
    Svensson Inc. Kinna, Sweden) that reduces incident irradiance to approximately
    50% of the incoming irradiance. Further details of the experimental facility can
    be found in Forbes et al. (2020). Three growth temperature treatments were implemented
    by setting chambers to track the external temperature profile with a chamberspecific
    offset, specifically a) 0ºC offset, b) -7ºC offset, and c) + 5ºC offset. These
    chamber temperature conditions mimic the lowland provenance, mountaintop provenance,
    and a lowland warming scenario, respectively. The climatic conditions were controlled
    via the Building Management System (BMS) with temperature and relative humidity
    (RH) in each chamber measured (QFM2160 Temperature and Humidity Probe, Siemens)
    and recorded at 5 min intervals in the BMS. We further characterized the temperature
    regimes with a Temperature Soil Moisture Sensor [TMS-4, TOMST s.r.o, Prague, (Wild
    et al., 2019)] in each experimental chamber to record the temperature in the immediate
    environment of the saplings. A summary of chamber conditions over the course of
    the experiment is given in Table 1. We calculated the VPD of each chamber from
    the temperature and relative humidity measurements (Campbell and Norman, 1998).
    ^p A minimum of three healthy saplings per soil treatment per species were monitored
    for growth in each chamber to give a total of 24 saplings (3 Saplings x 2 Soil
    treatments x 4 Species) per chamber. All pots were hand-watered to field capacity
    daily throughout the experiment. To avoid any chamber bias across the experimental
    treatments, the treatments were rotated among the chambers monthly.

  methods: Final biomass was measured from destructive harvests of three plants per
    species by treatment combination, except for F. bourjotiana in the nutrient-rich,
    elevated temperature treatment, where only two plants survived. Thus, a total
    of 71 plants were harvested for final biomass. The dry mass of leaves, stems and
    roots were measured separately and used to calculate Above Ground Biomass (AGB,
    sum of leaf and stem dry mass) and Below Ground Biomass (BGB, total root dry mass).
    The AGB and BGB were used to calculate the root-to-shoot ratio (R:S).
