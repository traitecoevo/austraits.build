  description: We ask whether correlations among above-ground and below-ground plant
    traits conform with predictions from resource-economic spectrum theory; and if
    root functional traits vary along a small-scale hydrologic gradient in the same
    manner as above-ground functional traits.
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: The site is within the study area of Letten et al.(2015) on a
    local soil moisture gradient, which marks a transition between two vegetation
    classes known as Sydney Coastal Heaths on drier soils and Coastal Heath Swamps
    on wetter soils (Keith 2004). We established eighteen 10- by 10-m plots across
    the hydrological gradient within our target vegetation community.The four above-ground
    traits measured were leaf size, specific leaf area, plant height and leaf dry-matter
    content following (Perez-Harguindeguy et al. 2013). These traits were chosen based
    on connection to key functions (Diaz et al. 2016; Garnier et al. 2016). For each
    species, these traits were measured on three individuals randomly selected from
    each of the quadrats, sampling at least three leaves on each individual for leaf
    traits. The four fine root traits measured were root branching intensity, specific
    root length, root tissue density and root dry-matter content. These traits were
    chosen to enable comparison of results to those of Kramer-Walter et al (2016)
    which explored variation in fine root traits across soil fertility gradients.
    At each of our quadrats, we measured these four fine root traits on up to three
    randomly selected individuals of each target species present in the plot, amounting
    to a total of 490 root samples.

    description: The study was conducted in an area of wet heathland vegetation within
      the Royal National Park, New South Wales, Australia (34 deg 5'43.22"S, 151 deg
      9'9.97"E) in May 2016 to January 2017. The site is within the study area of
      Letten et al.(2015) on a local soil moisture gradient, which marks a transition
      between two vegetation classes known as Sydney Coastal Heaths on drier soils
      and Coastal Heath Swamps on wetter soils (Keith 2004). Both communities are
      comprised of sclerophyllous woody shrub layer and an herbaceous ground layer
      (denser in heath swamp), with species in the Proteaceae, Ericaceae, Myrtaceae,
      Fabaceae, Restionaceae, Poaceae and Cyperaceae dominant throughout (Keith, 2004).
      The soils are sandy loams derived from sandstone, acidic and low in nutrient
      concentrations (Keith and Myerscough 1993). Parts of the site were subjected
      to low intensity burns in 2015 and in 1994. We sampled patches with different
      fire histories in order to control for some of the variation that may be induced
      by these events.

    RDMC was calculated as dry mass/ root volume (mg g-1). Root volume was determined
    using a pycnometer, with the difference between the pycnometer with and without
    roots plus the mass of the fine roots divided by the density of the water equalling
    the volume of the roots. Dry root sample placed in a paper envelope and dried
    over 48hrs at 60c in a drying oven. Mass measured on a balance to 3 dp (mg)

  methods: One sub-section of fine roots was used to calculate SRL (following Perez-Harguindeguy
    et al. 2013) and RBI (following Kramer-Walter et al. 2016). The subsection was
    digitally scanned using a CanoScan LiDE 100 flatbed scanners set at 600 dpi. To
    prevent root overlap, roots were suspended in water on transparency film and surrounded
    by a lip of plasticine. A 1 cm scale bar was placed beside all specimens to enable
    measurement of total root length using the software ImageJ. After the roots were
    scanned, they were placed in a paper bag and dried over 48 hours at 60 deg C in
    a drying oven before being weighed. Total root length and dry mass data were used
    to calculate specific root length (SRL) and root branching intensity (RBI). SRL
    was calculated as the total length of all the fresh first and second order roots
    divided by its dry mass (m g-1). RBI was calculated as the number of root tips
    divided by the total root length in centimetres (tips cm-1)

  methods: A second sub-section of fine roots was used to determine root tissue density
    (RTD) and root dry-matter content (RDMC). The fresh mass of the sub-section measured
    on a balance to 3 dp (mg). Root volume was determined using a pycnometer, with
    the difference between the pycnometer with and without roots plus the mass of
    the fine roots divided by the density of the water equalling the volume of the
    roots .(Jensen et al. 1969) The fine root sample was then placed in a paper envelope
    and dried over 48 hours at 60 deg C in a drying oven. The information determined
    from this was used to calculate RTD and RDMC. RTD was calculated as the dry mass
    / root volume (mg mm-3). RDMC was calculated as dry mass / fresh mass (mg g-1)
