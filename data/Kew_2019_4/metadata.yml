- var_in: oilcontentval
  unit_in: g/g
  trait_name: seed_oil_content
  entity_type: population
  value_type: mean
  basis_of_value: measurement
  replicates: unknown
  method_number: method_number
  measurement_remarks: measurement_remarks
  methods: Data sourced from various primary literature. For a species, the identical
    value often appears repeatedly under consecutive columns with different references
    - it seems sources have quoted one another and these aren't independent values
    so duplicates within a species have been filtered.
