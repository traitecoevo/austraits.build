  unit_in: g/g
  trait_name: seed_oil_content
  value_type: raw_value
  replicates: See columns in raw data file with specific information for each entry
  methods: Data sourced from various primary literature. For a species, the identical
    value often appears repeatedly under consecutive columns with different references
    - it seems sources have quoted one another and these aren't independent values
    so duplicates within a species have been filtered.
