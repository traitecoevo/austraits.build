  description: Study that reports on the post-fire regeneration strategies, post-fire
    juvenile period and flowering phenology of 639 species occurring predominantly
    in the southern forests and associated ecosystems of south-west Western Australia.
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: Information about post-fire regeneration strategies, flowering 
    time (month) and juvenile period (months) was gathered from study sites in the 
    southern forest region of the south-west of Western Australia (Fig. 1). The McCorkhill 
    and Yendicup forest sites each comprised 10 small (each 4 ha) adjacent plots that 
    were experimentally burnt at various times as part of a broader investigation
    into the long term effects of fire (see Burrows and Wardell-Johnson 2003). The 
    Lindsay forest site (Table 1) was similar except the plots were smaller (each 
    about 0.5 ha). Data from the Walpole study site (Table 1) were accumulated from 
    some 400 vegetation sample sites located throughout a broad range of vegetation 
    types represented in the Walpole-Nornalup National Park (see Wardell-Johnson et 
    al. 1989).

  methods: Post-fire regeneration strategy was assessed at each site by regular (3-4
    weekly) inspections until all species at the site had reached flowering age. Fire
    response strategies were determined by visual inspection and classified as shown
    in Table 2, which was adapted from Gill (1981). Some species regenerated by more 
    than one of the categories shown, e.g. depending on the fire intensity and the 
    physiological age of the plant (Burrows 1985), in which case species were deemed
    to be resprouters. Some thin-barked tall shrub species typically characterised
    as obligate seeders occassionally resprout after low intensity fire, which were
    classified as obligate seeders.

  methods: Juvenile period was assessed at each site by regular (3-4 weekly) inspections
    until all species at the site had reached flowering age. The juvenile period is 
    quite variable amongst individuals of the same species in the same population, 
    so we define juvenile period as the time taken for at least 50% of individuals 
    in a population to reach flowering age after fire. This was assessed visually.
