traits:
- var_in: height (m)
  unit_in: m
  trait_name: .na
  value_type: raw_value
  replicates: 1
  methods: Column in data file indicating that some individuals are not full-grown, suggesting this is an allometric measurement, not maximum height
- var_in: LMA
  unit_in: g/m2
  trait_name: specific_leaf_area
  value_type: unknown
  replicates: unknown
  methods: Leaf size was measured from scans.
- var_in: SRI_Huw
  unit_in: m2/m2
  trait_name: .na
  value_type: unknown
  replicates: unknown
  methods: SRI = cross sectional area of steep roots / total root cross section, such that SRI of 1 = 100% steep roots and  SRI of 0 = 100% shallow roots
- var_in: tip_RML
  unit_in: mg/m
  trait_name: .na
  value_type: unknown
  replicates: unknown
  methods: unknown
- var_in: root wood density (g cm-3)
  unit_in: mg/mm3
  trait_name: root_wood_density
  value_type: unknown
  replicates: unknown
  methods: Wood density was measured on a 4 cm length of wood, with an approximate cross-sectional area of 10 mm2, for each root. Roots were cut from laterals during root system excavations. 
- var_in: stem wood density (g cm-3)
  unit_in: mg/mm3
  trait_name: wood_density
  value_type: unknown
  replicates: unknown
  methods: Wood density was measured on a 4 cm length of wood, with an approximate cross-sectional area of 10 mm2, for each stem. I also have wood density data for the sections of stem where I attached sapflow sensors - a range of thicknesses, for 8 species.
- var_in: leaf size (mm2)

questions:
  contributor: Do you have an electronic copy of your thesis from which I could extract site data, sampling strategy and methods?
  question2: Also, regarding lat/lon coordinates for your 4 sites, are these some of the same sites used by others in the Westoby lab, such that I could find the coordinates in other studyes?
  additional_traits: Notes to AusTraits Team, there are additional root measurements, including ratio of steep to shallow rootps and 'tip_RML'
