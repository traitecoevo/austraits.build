traits:
- var_in: max_height_m
  unit_in: m
  trait_name: plant_height
  entity_type: population
  value_type: maximum
  basis_of_value: measurement
  replicates: 1
  methods: took maximum of many values given in spreadsheet
- var_in: LMA
  unit_in: g/m2
  trait_name: leaf_mass_per_area
  entity_type: population
  value_type: mean
  basis_of_value: measurement
  replicates: unknown
  methods: Leaf size was measured from scans.
- var_in: SRI_Huw
  unit_in: m2/m2
  trait_name: .na
  entity_type: population
  value_type: mean
  basis_of_value: measurement
  replicates: unknown
  methods: SRI = cross sectional area of steep roots / total root cross section, such
    that SRI of 1 = 100% steep roots and  SRI of 0 = 100% shallow roots
- var_in: tip_RML
  unit_in: mg/m
  trait_name: .na
  entity_type: population
  value_type: mean
  basis_of_value: measurement
  replicates: unknown
  methods: unknown
- var_in: root wood density (g cm-3)
  unit_in: mg/mm3
  trait_name: root_wood_density
  entity_type: population
  value_type: mean
  basis_of_value: measurement
  replicates: unknown
  methods: Wood density was measured on a 4 cm length of wood, with an approximate
    cross-sectional area of 10 mm2, for each root. Roots were cut from laterals during
    root system excavations.
- var_in: stem wood density (g cm-3)
  unit_in: mg/mm3
  trait_name: wood_density
  entity_type: population
  value_type: mean
  basis_of_value: measurement
  replicates: unknown
  methods: Wood density was measured on a 4 cm length of wood, with an approximate
    cross-sectional area of 10 mm2, for each stem. I also have wood density data for
    the sections of stem where I attached sapflow sensors - a range of thicknesses,
    for 8 species.
