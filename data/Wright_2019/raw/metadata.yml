  description: traits of NT savannah species
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: 'Deciduous, semi-deciduous and evergreen species are all present
    in this savanna. Hence, we sampled plant traits at two time points: at the end
    of one dry season (September 2010), when deciduous species are leafless and the
    canopies of semi-deciduous species are at their thinnest; and right at the end
    of the subsequent wet season (early May 2011), when most species still tend to
    have full or nearly-full canopies (Williams et al. 1997). We selected 17 species
    to study, based on available growth rate data and their availability across two
    nearby sub-sites (12 deg 27''10''''S, 131 deg 6''30''''E; 12 deg 27''57''''S,
    131 deg 6''51''''E). This species-set represents a range of functional types (trees
    and shrubs; nitrogen-fixers and non-fixers; deciduous, semi-deciduous and evergreen
    species; Table 1). We used diameter at breast height (DBH) to identify ''adults''
    versus ''saplings'' for each species, but we use these terms informally (i.e.
    not necessarily reflecting degree of reproductive maturity), and synonymously
    with ''small individuals'' and ''large individuals'' of each species (Prior et
    al. 2006). For species that are large trees at maturity we used a DBH cut-off
    of 6 cm to distinguish saplings from adults; for smaller trees and shrub species
    we used a 3 cm cut-off, with the exception of the small, short-lived and fast
    growing species Acacia difficilis, for which we used a cut-off of 1.5 cm DBH (Table
    1). When choosing plants to sample we prioritized individuals of each species
    which clearly fell into these size-defined ''sapling'' and ''adult'' categories,
    so as to minimize ambiguity in this regard. For each age/size class of each species
    we aimed to make trait measurements on each of five individuals.'

    description: 'We sampled species at Howard Springs Nature Reserve, 30 km east
      from Darwin. The savanna vegetation there is typical of the region, with an
      overstory dominated by eucalypts and an understory dominated by C4 grasses.
      Overstory leaf area index ranges between about 0.6 in the dry season to 1 in
      the wet season (Hutley et al. 2001). At Darwin airport (20 km to the west),
      long-term annual rainfall is 1736 mm, typically with >95% of rain falling during
      the wet season (October–April). Mean annual temperature is 27.6 deg C (data
      from www.bom.gov.au). Fires occur regularly in the dry season; typical fire
      return intervals in the region are 1–3 years (Russell-Smith et al. 2003). Soils
      at the site are sandy and low in nutrients: mean (and standard deviation) nutrient
      concentrations in eight soil samples (0– 20 cm depth) collected in September
      2010 were as follows: total C = 2.7% (1.8), total N = 0.093% (0.074), total
      P = 72.7 mg kg_1 (22.6).'

- var_in: WD kg/m3
  unit_in: kg/m3
  trait_name: wood_density
  value_type: raw
  replicates: 1
  methods: Stem tissue density (dry mass per fresh volume) was measured on 2 cm long
    branch segments of approximately 1 cm over-bark diameter. For dry season samples,
    density was measured on whole stems, including bark. For wet season samples, the
    bark was first removed, allowing us to measure relative dry mass allocation to
    bark versus sapwood. For these samples, stem density refers to that of the sapwood
    only (plus any pith, if present). Hereafter we refer to these quantities as 'WD'
    (wood density). At each date, five samples were taken per species/age class. Sample
    volumes were measured using standard procedure (via displacement), and dry masses
    after oven-drying at 70 deg C for 7 days.

  methods: 'A single terminal branch, 80 cm in length, was sampled from each of several
    individuals of each species/age class (average, 4.8 branches per species/age).
    These were divided into segments cut at 5, 10, 20, 40 and 80 cm from the terminal
    end and oven-dried at 70 degC for at least 5 days. For each 80 cm branch (and
    including material on any sidebranches) we calculated (i) total leaf dry mass,
    (ii) total stem dry mass, (iii) the ratio of leaf:stem dry mass for this 80 cm
    segment (hereafter LM:SM), (iv) the ratio of leaf area: stem dry mass (by multiplying
    leaf mass by the appropriate SLA value; hereafter LA:SM) and (v) the allometric
    slope describing leaf mass accumulation versus stem mass accumulation (hereafter
    a_LMSM). This slope was estimated for accumulations from the tip going back down
    the stem, expressed at the 5, 10, 20, 40 and 80 cm sampling points. These allometries
    were calculated as standardized major axis slopes (Warton et al. 2006) fitted
    to logtransformed data. The ''static ratio'' (LM:SM, LA:SM) and allometric (a_LMSM)
    descriptors were of course correlated, but sufficiently weakly (mean r2 across
    age/season datasets = 0.37) that they contained substantial independent information
    about branch-scale leaf:stem allocation.'
