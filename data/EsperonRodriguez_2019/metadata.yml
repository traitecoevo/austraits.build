  description: Unpublished data from the Which Plants Where Living Lab. The Living
    Lab at Hawkesbury aims to determine how plantings of differing structure (e.g.
    canopy height and density) differ in terms of the biodiversity they support.
  collection_type: field_experiment
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: The purpose of the Living Lab at Hawkesbury is to subject a selection
    of common landscape trees and shrubs to Richmond's often-harsh climate conditions.
    Variables were selected based on their previous literature acknowledging to be
    indicative of heat and drought tolerance.

    description: Irrigated plantings located at the Hawkesbury campus, University
      of Western Sydney. All trees are planted in a common garden subject to local
      climate (e.g. temperature and rainfall). Additionally, plants are irrigated
      for 40 minutes every seven days.
contexts: .na
traits:
- var_in: fv/fm
  unit_in: x/x
  trait_name: fv_over_fm
  value_type: raw_value
  replicates: 1
  methods: Plant stress measurement. Dividing variable fluorescence by maximum fluorescence.
    Fv/Fm was measured at pre-dawn using a MINI-PAM-II Photosynthesis Yield Analayzer
    (Heinz Walz Gmbh, Germany)
- var_in: gS (mmol m-2 s-1)
  unit_in: mmolH2O/m2/s
  trait_name: stomatal_conductance_per_area_ambient
  value_type: raw_value
  replicates: 1
  methods: Stomatal conductance (gS) was measured using a leaf porometer (Decagon
    SC-1, Washington, USA) at midday (12 hours, local time)
- var_in: Midday_leaf_water_potential (Mpa)
  unit_in: MPa
  trait_name: water_potential_midday
  value_type: raw_value
  replicates: 1
  methods: Midday leaf water potential was measured by obtaining by using a pressure
    chamber (PMS, Corvallis, Oregon, USA)
- var_in: LFM (g)
  unit_in: g
  trait_name: leaf_fresh_mass
  value_type: raw_value
  replicates: 1
  methods: Leaf fresh mass (LFM). Leaves were weighed immediately after collection
    to obtain their fresh mass
- var_in: LDM (g)
  unit_in: g
  trait_name: leaf_dry_mass
  value_type: raw_value
  replicates: 1
  methods: Leaf dry mass (LDM). Leaves were freeze-dried for 72 hours (h) and weighed
    to determine their dry mass
- var_in: LA (cm2)
  unit_in: cm2
  trait_name: leaf_area
  value_type: raw_value
  replicates: 1
  methods: Leaf area (LA). Individual leaf laminae were measured without petiole or
    rachis by scanning each leaf and using the software ImageJ (Version 1.52k).
- var_in: SLA (cm2 mg-1)
  unit_in: m2/kg
  trait_name: specific_leaf_area
  value_type: raw_value
  replicates: 1
  methods: Specific leaf area (SLA) was calculated by dividing the surface area of
    the fresh leaf and dry mass (Cornelissen et al. 2003)
