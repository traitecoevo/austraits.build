  description: Leaf pigment and reflectance dataset from Niinemets and Wright for sclerophylls
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: These data are unpublished, but other measurements at the same time were published by Niinemets in 2009. What follows is the sampling description for this study. A gradient of decreasing rainfall extends inland from the coast
    in this region. The two higher rainfall sites in Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park
    receive annually ~1.5-fold, and during the driest period between August and October
    ~1.8-fold, less precipitation than the two sites, located ~50 km west of Sydney
    in the Cumberland Plain (Castlereagh Nature Reserve and Agnes Banks Nature Reserve;
    Table 1). In both wetter and drier site pairs, the community on clay-rich soil
    had higher soil nutrient availabilities than that occurring on deep sands (Table
    1), with the drier/lower nutrient availability site (Agnes Banks) representing
    the extreme lowest values in soil nutrients, and the wetter/high nutrient site
    (West Head) the highest values (Table 1). At higher rainfall, the more fertile
    site supported closed forest with a rich understorey of ferns, cycads, shrubs,
    climbers, and herbs, while open woodland with species-rich heathy understorey
    occurs on the less fertile sand. The lower rainfall sites both supported open
    woodlands, with significant fractions of bare ground. A more detailed description
    of Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park sites is provided in Wright et al. (2001),
    while the drier sites are described in Benson (1992) and in NSW National Parks
    and Wildlife Service (1999). The overall aim in species selection was to obtain
    a broad, representative range of foliage architectures, longevities, and photosynthetic
    potentials across the sites. In addition, in each site, species with contrasting
    leaf structure and life span were selected to characterize site-specific variation
    and site effects on average foliage traits. As the major constraint in species
    selection, only broad-leaved species suitable for gas-exchange measurements with
    clip-on gas-exchange cuvettes were sampled. [See Rodeghiero et al. (2007) for
    extensive discussion of problems in gas-exchange measurements in leaves that do
    not entirely fill the small cuvette window or that result in extensive air passage
    between the cuvette gaskets.] At the more speciose, higher rainfall sites, 10
    species were sampled at the more fertile site and 13 species at the less fertile
    site. Six species were sampled at the more fertile low rainfall site, and three
    from the low nutrient site. To expand the overall variation range in foliage traits,
    naturally established individuals of three species (Pittosporum undulatum, Polyscias
    sambucifolia, and Acacia longifolia) and planted individuals of three other species
    (Banksia integrifolia, Banksia robur, and Macadamia ternifolia) were sampled in
    the forest and parklands of the Macquarie University campus, North Ryde, Sydney
    (33째46'S, 151째06' E). The campus environment with annual average precipitation
    of 1132 mm, annual average maximum temperature of 22.8째C and minimum temperature
    of 11.2째C, and high nutrient availability most closely resembles the wetter/high
    nutrient availability site (Table 1). Neither foliage N (P >0.13) nor foliage
    P (P >0.5) contents per mass differed between campus and wetter/high nutrient
    site according to analysis of variance (ANOVA). Altogether 35 species were studied
    across all sites (see Appendix I for the species list with key foliage traits).
    Two of the studied species are gymnosperms (cycads - Macrozamia communis and M.
    spiralis); all others are angiosperms. Six species (Acacia falcata, A. longifolia,
    A. myrtifolia, A. suaveolens, Macrozamia communis, and M. spiralis) are nitrogen
    fixers.

questions:
  additional_traits: Ian Wright has data on absorption, reflection, and transmission for each wavelength (by nanometer).
  contributor: Would it be OK to combine sites "KNCP_east" and "Murrua Track", as per a note in a file (Although isn't the Challenger Track further east?) Also, is MUgarden the same as either MUforest?
  question2: In the data.csv file (combined data), for two of the "ID" values there are different species names in the gas exchange vs pigment files. For ID 95, there are two different species of Agathis listed and for ID 96 there are two different species of Acacia. Do you know which is correct?
  question3: I've made the assumption based on replicate counts, total samples that the absorption data was measured on different plants than the other data and therefore haven't tried to align it with the other values. Is this correct?
  question4: Do you have brief methods for the pigment data and absorption data?
