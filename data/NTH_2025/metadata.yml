  methods: Note, the data for leaf phenology includes the option 'death of plant and
    regeneration from seed (include all annuals here)', which represents annual plants.
    This trait value is being dropped from leaf phenology, assuming it is also mapped
    via the trait 'life_history'. At some point we might revisit what the best mapping
    is for plants that are sometimes deciduous and sometimes annuals.
