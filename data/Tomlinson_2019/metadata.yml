  description: An investigation of how tree species differ in response to competition
    from grasses and nutrient supply, and whether these responses can be related to
    plant traits.
  basis_of_record: lab
  life_stage: sapling
  sampling_strategy: 'Species selection: We sampled dominant or abundant tree species
    from humid and semi-arid savannas in Africa, Australia, and South America (previously
    described in Tomlinson et al., 2012). We identified semi-arid and humid environments
    using the Koppen-Geiger climate classification (Kottek, Grieser, Beck, Rudolf,
    & Rubel, 2006), which estimates the relative water deficits of particular locations
    by comparing a dryness threshold based on the mean annual temperature (Tann, deg
    C) with mean annual precipitation (MAP, mm) at those locations, adjusted for whether
    the region has predominantly winter or summer rainfall. Given a dryness threshold
    Pth = 28 + 2 (Tann), then semi-arid environments are defined as areas with 5 Pth
    < MAP <10 Pth and humid environments are defined as areas with MAP > 10 Pth. We
    sampled species from humid and semi-arid summer-rainfall savannas in eastern Southern
    Africa (coastal and inland savannas in South Africa and Zimbabwe), in north-eastern
    Australia (coastal and inland woodlands in Queensland), and in eastern South America
    (Cerrado and Caatinga biomes in Brazil) (Cole, 1986). The chosen species are abundant
    in the climate types where they were sampled. A total of 40 species were used
    in this experiment, including 18 species from Africa (8 humid, 10 semi-arid),
    12 species from Australia (5 humid, 7 semi-arid), and 10 species from South America
    (7 humid, 3 semi-arid). Greenhouse experiment: We conducted a greenhouse experiment
    to evaluate the performance of the 40 savanna tree species under competition with
    grasses grown in a common growth environment. Plants were grown in a greenhouse
    chamber at Radix Research Farm, Wageningen University, the Netherlands (51deg
    59''17''''N, 5deg 39''45''''E) between September 2008 and October 2010. Temperature
    in the greenhouse was set at 28deg C for 12 hr (daytime) and 23deg C for 12 hr
    (night-time), within the range of mean minimum temperatures (17.4-24.2 deg C)
    and mean daily temperatures (24.8-30.3 deg C) during the warmest month of the
    locations where seeds were collected for the experiments. Daily variation of light
    was from 150 to 450 umol m-2 s-1, supplied from sunshine and supplementary light
    (150 umol m-2 s-1), which was provided for 12-16 hr (seasonally adjusted) to ensure
    that the photon flux density exceeded 10 mol m-1 d-1. This is less than one quarter
    of the light these species might receive in tropical savannas, where daily values
    range from 31.6 in winter (dry season) to 62.9 mol m-1 d-1 in summer (wet season)
    (Huntley & Walker, 1982), but the plants in the greenhouse achieved substantial
    growth during the first growing season (Tomlinson, Poorter, et al., 2013) and
    this growth varied significantly among species (Tomlinson et al., 2012), indicating
    that available light was sufficient to distinguish growth abilities. Other studies
    have shown that the total daily photon flux density, rather than peak irradiance,
    is most important for plant growth (Poorter & Van der Werf, 1998). Tree seedlings
    were grown in plastic tubes (10 cm diameter, 100 cm length) in a fully crossed
    design of high and low nutrient treatments (Nh and Nl respectively), with and
    without grass competition (G1 and G0 respectively). Pots were filled with river
    sand mixed with slow-release (8-9 months) fertilizer (Osmocot 18-6-12 [N-P-K]
    fertilizer). Nutrient treatments were, respectively, 5 kg and 1 kg fertilizer
    m-3 river sand; the nutrient concentration levels for the high nutrient treatment
    were intermediate between the company specifications for low application (4.2
    kg/m) and medium application (6.2 kg/m) for the product. We chose the low end
    of the recommended nutrient application to try to ensure that the nutrients were
    limiting to growth for most species. The high and low treatments were different
    in order to cause significant differences in growth between treatments for most
    species (see Results). Grass competition was imposed by growing one seedling of
    the C4 grass species Eragrostis curvula alongside each tree seedling. Eragrostis
    curvula is native to savannas in southern and eastern Africa (Fish, Mashau, Moeaha,
    & Nembudani, 2015) and has been introduced as a pasture species throughout the
    tropics, becoming invasive across a wide rainfall range in Australia and the Americas
    (Csurhes, Leigh, & Walton, 2016). It grows fast and recruits tillers rapidly,
    making it highly competitive for resources. The grass seedlings were grown to
    the three-tiller stage (see Supporting information Figure S1) in seedling trays
    and planted at the same time as the recently germinated tree seedlings into the
    growing tubes. Water was supplied through irrigation at a rate of 40 ml per pot
    per day, equivalent to 800 mm of rainfall over 20 weeks of growth. This is similar
    to the amount of rainfall that humid savannas in Africa, Australia, and South
    America receive during the 5- to 7-month growing season (see Supporting information
    Table S2, for actual rainfall received and length of average growing season).
    However, our greenhouse plants received a much more even supply than they would
    receive in their natural environment. Seedlings were grown for 20 weeks and then
    harvested. A maximum of 10 individuals were grown per treatment per species (range:
    5-10), yielding a maximum replication per species of 40 individuals. The total
    dataset comprised of 1,446 individual plants: 361 in the NhG0 treatment, 358 in
    the NhG1 treatment, 372 in the NlG0 treatment, and 355 in the NlG1 treatment.
    Due to space limitations, we grew the plants in three batches with species grown
    in either one (10 individuals per treatment combination) or two batches (five
    individuals per treatment combination per batch) out of the three. Trait measurements
    We measured morphological and physiological traits that are thought to aid plants
    to capture or retain soil nutrients and water or capture light for rapid growth
    (Cornelissen et al., 2003; Westoby, Falster, Moles, Vesk, & Wright, 2002). Measured
    traits that support light capture were specific leaf area (SLA, cm2 g-1), leaf
    assimilation rate (Am, nmol CO2 g-1 s-1), leaf nitrogen content (Nm, mg N g-1),
    and stem extension rate (SER, mm/d). We measured three root traits which may affect
    the ability and efficiency of plants to capture soil resources (water or nutrients),
    namely root extension rate (RER, mm/d), specific taproot length (STRL, m/g), and
    root mass fraction (RMF, g root mass/g total mass). We measured leaf traits that
    support efficient water use including stomatal conductance (gs, umol H2O m-2 s-1),
    plant photosynthetic water use efficiency (PWUE, umol CO2 umol-1 H2O), leaf phosphorus
    and potassium content (Pm, mg P g-1; Km, mg K g-1). Finally, we measured traits
    that may support efficient growth under low nutrient supply, including leaf nutrient
    concentrations (phosphorus and potassium content again [Pm, mg P g-1; Km, mg K
    g-1]), and the initial mass of recently germinated seedlings (Mass0, g), which
    represents the initial resources allocated to a seedling in a seed. Mass0 is directly
    related to seed mass, but is more accurate for initial resources allocated to
    a seedling because it only measures the living individual after emergence from
    the seed and therefore excludes biomass associated with the seed coat and other
    appendages not related to growth. To calculate Mass0, we harvested 10 recently
    germinated seedlings, dried and weighed them, and then averaged the estimated
    weights. A full description of the measurement of the traits is provided in the
    Supporting Information and species'' trait values are given in Table S3. Although
    most trait measurements were collected per individual for all treatments, we calculated
    species-level mean trait values from across individuals of each species grown
    in the G0 treatments (NhG0 and NlG0) for the analyses described below. This was
    because numerous traits change with plant size (McConnaughay & Coleman, 1999)
    and, as our grass treatment severely suppresses plant size, we could not separate
    treatment effects on traits from plant size effects on those traits. Therefore,
    we restricted ourselves to trait differences between species rather than also
    considering species'' trait plasticity in response to treatments.'

  notes: Plant mass is available in the data.csv file, under the column heading 'Mass_g'.
    Several of the traits measured will shift with plant size, especially in seedlings,
    so data users may find this an important covariate. Additional traits measured
    on these same species is available under Tomlinson_2013, including leaf_area,
    leaf_mass_fraction, and stem_mass_fraction.

    C for at least 48 hours. After drying, plant biomass was separated into organ
    fractions (cotyledon, leaf, stem, root), dried and weighed to obtain dry masses
    of cotyledon, leaf, stem, root and total (Mass), from which the respective organ
    mass fractions could be calculated (LMF, SMF, RMF). Regarding the lower values
    in this study, the author notes that one of the species studied had very low root

  methods: Area-based assimilation rates (Aa, umol CO2 m-2 s-1) and stomatal conductance

    PP-System, Hitchin, UK) on the youngest fully developed leaves on plants 1 to
    2 weeks prior to harvesting. Leaf assimilation rates were measured at an irradiance
    of 600 umol m-2 s-1 provided by a PLC6 Leaf Cuvette. Readings were taken when
    plants were fully induced and photosynthetic rates had stabilised. Readings were
    taken at 600 umol m-2 s-1 because maximum Aa measurements stabilised around this
    light supply rate, as indicated by the photosynthetic light response curves that
    we measured for several of our species. This may have occurred because of the
    low peak growth light levels that we were able to supply to our plants in the
    greenhouse (up to 450 umol m-2 s-1). Regarding the lower values in this study,
    the author notes, some of these plants were very small, because of the effect
    of grass competition, so the plants were fairly stressed.  So the values are not
    unreasonable to my mind. Also, the plants were grown in a greenhouse in the Netherlands.
    We tried to increase light supply, but this was still way below what these species
    might experience in the wild. Plant mass is available in the data.csv file, under

    the lower values in this study, the author notes, some of these plants were very
    small, because of the effect of grass competition, so the plants were fairly stressed
    and the values are not unreasonable. Plant mass is available in the data.csv file,
    under the column heading 'Mass_g'. Several of the traits measured will shift with
    plant size, especially in seedlings, so data users may find this an important
    covariate.

  methods: At harvest time, up to six fully expanded fresh leaves were sampled from
    each plant. These were immediately scanned with a flatbed scanner (CanoScan LIDE
    100, Canon) to obtain their surface area. Then the plants were dried at 70 deg
    C for at least 48 hours. After drying, plant biomass was separated into organ
    fractions (cotyledon, leaf, stem, root), dried and weighed to obtain dry masses
    of cotyledon, leaf, stem, root and total (Mass), from which the respective organ
    mass fractions could be calculated (LMF, SMF, RMF). Plant mass is available in
    the data.csv file, under the column heading 'Mass_g'. Several of the traits measured
    will shift with plant size, especially in seedlings, so data users may find this
    an important covariate.
