  description: An assessment that can then be used to predict where seed might be
    needed for targeted reintroduction to ensure that 1) natural regeneration is supported,
    and 2) limited seed resources are only used where required and/or appropriate.
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: To estimate required seedling inputs, we undertook literature
    searches across national recovery plans, peer-reviewed journal articles and books
    and revegetation guidelines to obtain plant density information and restoration
    densities for each community. Where possible, we verified and supplemented published
    data with personal communication with key researchers, managers and practitioners
    from a range of organisations. Key searches included specific species within each
    TEC, TEC level data and, where required, were extended to community type natural
    vegetation densities.
