    description: The soil type at the study sites is a silty clay loam of high P-fixation
      capacity and is rich in iron and aluminium oxides and poor in available N and
      P (Bennett and Adams 1999). Long-term annual rainfall at Hamersley Station is
      354 mm, divided between 2 rainy seasons, December–March and May–August. Roughly
      two-thirds of the annual total falls in the summer period and one-third during
      winter. Because of this rainfall distribution, both summer and winter ephemeral
      forbs grow in the Pilbara. During June 1996– June 1997, the total rainfall was
      596 mm, with 73% falling during the warmer months of December–March (Fig. 1).
      The mean monthly maximum temperature was about 36°C in January, and in July,
      the mean monthly minimum temperature fell to 6°C

  contributor: Do you have an electronic, non-pdf version of the methods
    in the mauscript. The manuscript is in an old pdf format which does not allow
    text to be copied and pasted.
