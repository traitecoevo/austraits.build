      description: The soil type at the study sites is a silty clay loam of high P-fixation capacity and is rich in iron and aluminium oxides and poor in available N and P (Bennett and Adams 1999). Long-term annual rainfall at Hamersley Station is 354 mm, divided between 2 rainy seasons, December–March and May–August. Roughly two-thirds of the annual total falls in the summer period and one-third during winter. Because of this rainfall distribution, both summer and winter ephemeral forbs grow in the Pilbara. During June 1996– June 1997, the total rainfall was 596 mm, with 73% falling during the warmer months of December–March (Fig. 1). The mean monthly maximum temperature was about 36°C in January, and in July, the mean monthly minimum temperature fell to 6°C
