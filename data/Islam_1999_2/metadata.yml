  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: 'We established an experiment with a complete block design with
    2 treatments (control; and +200 kg!ha Pas superphosphate) and 3 replicates. The
    size of each plot was 4 m x 20 m with a onemeter buffer between control and +P
    plots in each block and a minimum of 40 m between blocks. The dominant vegetation
    at the site was Eriachne helmsii (Buck wanderrie grass) and Triodia basedowii
    (hard spinifex). At different times of the year, other species of forbs and grasses
    comprised the remaining vegetation, the most abundant being: grasses - Paspalidium
    dementi (Clements paspalidium) and Iseilema membranaceu (small Flinders grass);
    and forbs - Abutilon otocarpum (desert chinese lantern), Cullen cinerum (marshmallow)
    and Sida fibulifera (silver sida ). At 3-monthly intervals, we sampled all species
    present in each plot.'

    description: The experiment was conducted at Hamersley Station, 40 km north-west
      of Tom Price, Western Australia, Australia (22 deg 20 'S, 117 deg 37 'E) during
      1996-97. The site has a semi-arid, subtropical climate, with hot summers and
      mild winters and lies within the Fortescue Botanical District (Beard 1975).
      The Pilbara region is characterised by highly variable annual and seasonal distribution
      of rainfall with a generally dry winter season. Total rainfall from June 1996-July
      1997 was 535 mm with 81% falling during December 1996-February 1997. Surface
      soils (0-10 em) at the study site had a pH of 7.1(+/- 0.5; +/- s.e.); an organic
      matter concentration of 1.21% (+/- 1.04); nitrogen concentration of 0.99 mg!g
      (+/- 0.4); available phosphorus of 4.7 ~-tg/g (+/- 1.2); and an electrical conductivity
      of 55.4 ~ -tS/cm (+/- 3.4). Further details of the climate, soils and general
      vegetation of the region may be found in Bennett and Adams (1999).

  methods: Samples of the foliage (only green leaves) were collected from at least
    6 individuals of each species in each plot and bulked. Plant material was stored
    cold ( < 4 oq on the day of collection and then frozen in liquid N until it was
    returned to Perth where it was freeze-dried. Dried material was then finely ground
    using a ball mill. Laboratory analyses of the dried plant material included colorimetric
    assays of total N and P (Murphy and Riley 1962; Keeney and Nelson 1982) after
    Kjeldahl digestion. The same digest was used for the analysis of K, Mg and Ca
    via atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Nitrate concentrations were measured
    using the method of Cataldo eta!. (1975).
