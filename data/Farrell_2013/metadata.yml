  description: A study to determine whether granite outcrop species could improve
    green roof performance by evaluating water use strategies under contrasting water
    availability.
  basis_of_record: lab
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: Species selection ^p   Twelve species which grow on granite outcrops
    in southeastern Australia (chosen from Victorian Ecological Vegetation Class (EVC)
    characteristic species lists) along with a succulent commonly used on green roofs
    (Sedum pachyphyllum) were selected for this study. The 12 granite outcrop species
    were from three life-forms, 4 grasslike monocots; 4 herbs and 4 small shrubs (Table
    1). They were obtained as six-month old seedlings from a commercial nursery; while
    S. pachyphyllum was propagated from cuttings and grown for 6 months. In early
    summer (December), 20 plants of uniform size of each species were planted into
    4 L black plastic pots (200 mm diameter, 190mmheight) containing 4.4 kg (added
    by weight) of a scoria-based green roof substrate (60%aerolite black scoria 7
    mm minus block mix; 20 % 7 mm red scoria aggregate and 20%coir). The scoria substrate
    has a water holding capacity of 46 % and a bulk density of 1.26 g cm-3 (Farrell
    et al. 2013). Twelve grams of low phosphorous slow release fertiliser (Osmocote
    plus, Scotts Australia Pty Ltd.; 16 nitrogen (N):1.3 phosphorus (P):9.1 potassium
    (K)) was added to the surface of each pot 1 month post-planting. Plants were grown
    in a glasshouse at the Burnley Campus, University of Melbourne. Glasshouse temperatures
    ranged from 9 to 42.5 degC, with an average temperature of 18.7 degC during the
    experiment. All plants were watered to pot capacity twice a week prior to the
    start of the experiment. ^p   Experimental design ^p    The experiment ran for
    50 days, commencing on the 7th of February (Mid-summer) and finishing on the 28th
    of March (Mid-autumn), 2011. Five plants of each species were randomly allocated
    to two treatments, well watered (WW) and water deficit (WD). An additional 10
    substrate-only pots were used to determine evaporation rates from WW and WD treatments
    during the experiment (5 pots per treatment). Pots were arranged in a complete
    randomised block design (5 blocks). All plants were watered twice weekly (Monday
    and Thursday). WW plants were watered to pot capacity (2 L per pot) while the
    WD treatment was watered with 20 % of the water used by well watered plants (determined
    gravimetrically) in the 3- 4 days preceding each watering event. This WD treatment
    was designed to stress each species relative to its well watered control and was
    used in preference to a terminal drought treatment to allow sufficient time for
    each species to adjust both physiological and morphological traits to low water
    availability.

  methods: Plants received their final watering event mid-morning on day 50. Pre-dawn
    (PD) andmidday (MD) leaf water potential were determined the following day (Day
    51) on five replicates of each species from WWand WD treatments. Leaf water potentials
    of fully-expanded leaves were measured using a Scholander-type pressure chamber
    (Soilmoisture Equipment Corp., Santa Barbara, CA, USA). Due to short petiole lengths,
    some water potentials were measured on apical branches with 2-3 leaves.Some difficulty
    was encountered in identifying the balancing pressure for Isotoma axillaris and
    Arthropodium milleflorum due to production of latex (I. axillaris) or mucilage
    (A. milleflorum) from the cut surface. Applying pressure as per normal confused
    the signal between expression of wound-response fluid and the water column. This
    was overcome by maintaining the section at a low pressure (0.1 MPa) in the chamber
    to promote expression of wound-response fluid. Once all fluids were expressed
    and wiped from the cut surface (which generally took <1 min), pressure in the
    chamber was then increased as per normal to reach the balancing point. Leaf water
    potential measurements of S. pachyphyllum were not captured in this experiment
    due to high leaf succulence.

  methods: Leaf pre-dawn relative water contents (RWC) were also determined at the
    end of the experiment (Day 51) on five replicates of each species from WW and
    WD treatments. RWC was determined as, RWC = (fresh weight-dry weight) / (saturated
    weight - dry weight) * 100. Fresh weights were weighed immediately after re-cutting
    the stem/petiole under water before placing the leaf/small apical branch (as per
    leaf water potential measurements) in 50 ml centrifuge tubes with deionised water.
    Saturated weights were measured after samples had rehydrated in darkness at room
    temperature which ranged from 21 to 24 degC. Samples were then oven dried at 70
    degC to a constant weight to determine dry weight.

  methods: At the start of the experiment, 5 plants of each species were harvested
    to determine initial biomass (root, stem and leaf mass) and leaf area. At the
    conclusion of the experiment, on the 30 March all WW and WD plants were harvested
    to determine total plant, leaf, stem and root masses. Leaf areas on a subsample
    of leaves of all species were measured using a LI3100 area meter (Li-Cor, Lincoln,
    NE, USA). Dry weights were determined after oven drying samples at 70 deg C for
    1 week (until a constant weight was reached). Dry weights and leaf areas were
    used to determine root mass fraction (RMF, g root g-1 total plant), leaf area
    ratio (LAR, m2 leaf kg-1 plant) and specific leaf area (SLA m2 kg-1 leaf).

  methods: Transpiration (E) was determined by weighing pots before and after each
    watering event. Transpiration was calculated by subtracting evaporation (determined
    from substrate only pots) from total water lost from each pot at each weighing
    event. Cumulative transpiration was calculated as the sum of transpiration over
    the 50 days of the experiment. Daily transpiration per pot and per unit final
    leaf area were then calculated from cumulative transpiration.Transpiration per
    unit biomass (E) was determined by dividing cumulative transpiration by final
    biomass (dry weight) at the end of the experiment. (units are g H2O/g biomass.)
