  description: Study investigating the interspecific differences in vulnerability
    to xylem embolism of four phreatophytes, two facultative phreatophytes and two
    obligate phreatophytes. Species differences at the same position along an ecohydrological
    gradient on the Gnangara Groundwater Mound, Western Australia were determined
    in addition to intraspecific differences to water stress between populations in
    contrasting ecohydrological habitats.
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: adults
  sampling_strategy: Sampling was conducted at six sites within a 3 km radius that
    represent contrasting ecohydrological habitats. Groundwater depth was measured
    using piezometers, with depth to groundwater ranging from 1.5 m in the dampland
    to 3.2 m within the dampland embankment. Stems with 4 to 6 bud scars, thus ranging
    in age from 4 to 6 years, were collected. Stem segments approximately 30 cm in
    length were collected from each individual and were double-bagged in moist plastic
    bags, placed in a black plastic bag, kept cool and transported to the laboratory.
    They were then kept in bags in a refrigerator at 4 °C until they were used, and
    unused stems were discarded after 48 h. One tree equates to one replicate, with
    10 replicates for each species at each site.

    description: Banksia woodland on the nothern Swan Coastal Plain, approximately
      35km north of Perth, Western Australia. Sampling was conducted within the Lexia
      wetland system situated on the Gnangara Groundwater Mound. The study area substrate
      is comprised of the Bassendean dune system, an ancient sand deposit with an
      undulating geomorphology and diverse eco-hydrological habitat.

  methods: Vulnerability to xylem embolism was determined as the relationship between
    PLC and xylem water potential (Sperry & Tyree 1988). Stems were trimmed to lengths
    10% longer than the maximum vessel lengths recorded by Froend & Drake (2006) with
    a razor blade under distilled water. Cavitation events were induced by the air
    injection principle (Cochard, Cruiziat & Tyree 1992; Sperry & Saliendra 1994),
    which stimulates air embolism by use of positive pressures. Once sealed inside
    a pressure collar, stem ends were fitted to a steady-state flow meter (SSFM).
    The SSFM uses a pressure drop across PeekTM capillary tubing (which was maintained
    at less than 5kPa) of a known diameter ordered in series with the stem segment.
    An initial maximum measurement of hydraulic conductivity kh (kg m s^-1 MPa^-1)
    (Patino, Tyree & Herre 1995) was made after flushing the stem with a filtered
    (0.11µm) degassed perfusion solution (1 mm KCl in double-distilled water). Air
    was then injected into the collar to a desired pressure and maintained for 15
    min. The air injection pressure is equivalent to the water potential of xylem
    multiplied by negative one. The pressure in the collar was then slowly released
    and kh was remeasured. This procedure was repeated to progressively higher pressures
    (ranging from 0.0 to 5.0 MPa). To describe the relationship between PLC and Yx
    exponential sigmoidal functions (Pammenter & Vander Willigen 1998) were fitted
    to the data.

  basis_of_value: measurement

  methods: Using the same apparatus as described for vulnerability curves, maximum
    hydraulic conductivity of stem xylem, normalized to stem cross-sectional area
    (Ks; in kg s^-1 m^-1 MPa^-1), was measured in stem segments according to the general
    principle of Zimmermann (1978). See manuscript for definition of Ks. Measurements
    of Ks were made after removing embolisms; hence the values reported could be described
    as maximum hydraulic conductivity.

  methods: Leaf specific hydraulic conductivity (KL), defined here as the mass flow
    movement of water through the stem per unit of pressure gradient per unit of leaf
    area, was determined as KL = KS x H (kg s^-1 m^-1 MPa^-1), where H is the Huber
    value, the ratio of stem cross sectional area Ax (m2) to leaf area AL(m2) receiving
    water from that stem. Leaf area was measured with an area meter (model Delta-T
    Type WDIGC-2, Delta T Devices, Cambridge UK) and Ax was measured accurately with
    digital callipers.

  methods: Huber value, the ratio of stem cross sectional area Ax(m2) to leaf area
    AL(m2) receiving water from that stem. Leaf area was measured with an area meter
    (model Delta-T Type WDIGC-2, Delta T Devices, Cambridge UK) and Ax was measured
    accurately with digital callipers. Xylem cross-sectional area was considered to
    relate very closely to stem cross-sectional area (bark removed) in the small diameter
    stems of this study.
