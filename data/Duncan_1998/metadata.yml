  description: leaf morphology from NSW species from David Duncan. Collected while
    at Macquarie University.
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: Sites visited were drawn from a latitude band 30 - 35 degree
    south in NSW, Australia.  This setting has a rainfall gradient from ca 1500 mm
    p.a. at the coast down to ca 200 mm in inland western NSW, across more than 1000
    km.  This area lies between southern winter and northern summer rainfall zones
    and consequently, considering long-term averages, rainfall is aseasonal.  Total
    soil phosphorus is the usual indicator of soil fertility (Beadle 1954) and within
    the study area total soil P values range from ca 20 - 2000 ug g-1.  There is a
    tree canopy of varying density, but most of the perennial species complement is
    made up of shrubs. Shading has not been regarded as a dominant factor in vegetation
    dynamics, unlike forests in the wet tropics and much of the northern hemisphere,
    where species strategies are routinely summarised in terms of shade-tolerance
    versus requirement for canopy gaps.  By avoiding the small proportion of the landscape
    that is above 600 m elevation, one can remain within a relatively narrow band
    (15-18oC) of mean annual temperature. ^p 80 species in three clades, the Myrtaceae
    (24spp), Proteaceae (25spp) and Poales (18spp) were sampled from 21 sites within
    the latitude band 30 - 35 degrees South, and from a range of rainfall and soil
    nutrient conditions, in New South Wales, Australia (Appendix A for sites, Appendix
    B for species).  Sampling was undertaken between February 1998 and August 1999.  In
    the first phase, sites were selected on the basis of their annual rainfall and
    soil total P with the intention of spreading sampling across the range of these
    site variables.  In this phase species in the three clades were sampled at random,
    up to five species per clade per site.  In the second phase, locations were sought
    that represented rainfall-soil combinations not previously sampled, and specific
    taxa or growth forms.  Sampling of five individuals was not achieved in all cases
    (see Appendix B for replication per species).  While this study was aimed at differences
    between species, some species were sampled at more than one location.  Those data
    were reduced to a species mean for the graphs and description of results unless
    explicitly referred to in the text.  At each site an even profile of the top 10cm
    of soil was taken at up to five locations.  These samples were air dried and analysed
    for soil total P (solid fusion / XRF crystallography).  Soil nutrient analyses
    were conducted at the laboratories of the Division of Plant Industry, CSIRO, Canberra.

    USA); Scion VG-5 frame grabbing board and Scion Image Beta II & III software (Scion
    Corporation, USA).  RGB colour setup: DC-330 CCD color video camera (DAGE-MTI,
    USA); Scion CG-7 Frame grabbing board and Scion Image version 1.6 software (Scion
    Corporation, USA).  Quantification and analysis of TS images was performed using
    Scion Image software for PC (Beta II & Beta III, Scion Corporation, USA).    Linear
    measurements of the depth of all tissue layers were recorded at four locations
    between midrib and margin and the average calculated for each species.  Average
    lamina depth was calculated as the area of TS divided by the length of cross-section.  Spongy
    mesophyll was estimated by subtracting all other tissue layer depths from the
    average lamina depth.'
