  description: Plant growth form data extracted from the long profiles on Florabase,
    the Western Australia online flora.
  basis_of_record: preserved_specimen
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: This dataset is sourced from the longer taxon profiles on the
    Florabase online website (version date 2022-09-14). Briefly, the textual descriptions
    of each taxon in were downloaded and organised into a tabular format of individual
    taxon names and their corresponding text using R coding script. Sentences and
    phrases were categorised using a large glossary of botanical terminology as referring
    to one of the following, the entire organism, stem, leaf, flower, fruit/seed,
    roots and environment/habitat. Key terms corresponding to trait values in AusTraits
    were then extracted from these smaller chunks of text using a reference table
    containing a) the AusTraits trait name, b) the AusTraits trait value and c) terms
    to search for in the text. The resulting traits were then checked manually using
    a subset of ~500 taxa to search for errors and update the reference table and
    coding script accordingly. The process was repeated iteratively to remove any
    wrongly classified trait values and to ensure as many correct trait values as
    possible were captured using the algorithm. For some traits such as plant_growth_form
    and life_history, unclassified taxa were inferred as possessing a trait value
    from a higher-level taxonomic description e.g. all taxa in the Amyema genus were
    classified as stem_parasitic, which was mentioned only in the genus description.
    Specific to the plant_growth_form trait, any taxon without a growth form and that
    was described as annual, biennial or perennial was inferred as herbaceous.
