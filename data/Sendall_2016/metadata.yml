  description: field data in northern NSW looking at the trade-off between juvenile
    growth potential vs shade tolerance
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: sapling
  sampling_strategy: We aimed to sample subsets of species that represented the range
    of shade tolerance and growth rates present in old-growth assemblages on the two
    substrates (Table 2). To this end, we selected the most abundant of those tree
    species that were well-represented by juveniles in shaded understories (e.g. Argyrodendron
    trifoliolatum and Castanospermum australe on basalt, Elaeocarpus sedentarius on
    rhyolite), as well as the most common of those regenerating mainly on recently
    disturbed open sites (e.g. Polyscias murrayi on basalt, Callicoma serratifolia
    on rhyolite), and some that were common in intermediate-light environments (e.g.
    Diploglottis australis on basalt, Austrobuxus swainii on rhyolite). Previous work
    has confirmed the existence of a wide range of shade tolerance in assemblages
    on basalt (Lusk et al. 2010), but less is known about the light requirements of
    species associated with rhyolite. Our selection included one generalist species
    that was fairly common on both substrates (Sarcopteryx stipata).

    description: 'The study was carried out in Nightcap National Park (NSW, Australia),
      which has a subtropical climate with high rainfall in the summer and autumn,
      and a short dry season in winter. Mean annual rainfall at the nearest meteorological
      station (Whian Whian) is estimated at 2300 mm and mean annual temperature at

      were made in two forest stands of ca. 10 ha in area located at 28deg 630S, 153deg
      360E and 28deg 640S, 153deg 340E at elevations of 200-300 m above sea level.
      The first stand at Nightcap Range Road is associated with rhyolite soil, while
      the second stand at Rocky Creek Dam grows on basalt soil. The basalt soils are
      deeper and more fertile, containing much higher levels of phosphorus than rhyolite
      soils, as well as a significantly lower C : N ratio. As a result of this difference
      in resource availability, the forest communities are quite different. Stands
      on basalt are much more species-rich, while stands on rhyolite are relatively
      low in complexity and often dominated by just a few species (Royer et al. 2009).
      We chose sites on each substrate with little relief to ensure that drainage
      and water availability did not vary much between comparisons.'

  methods: Specific leaf area (SLA) was calculated using one fully expanded leaf or
    leaflet harvested from the outer portion of the crown of each individual tagged
    for growth measurements. For individuals used for gas exchange measurements, the
    leaf or leaflet measured was marked to ensure that it was collected for SLA. Leaves
    were scanned and the projected area was determined using the image-processing
    software ImageJ (Abramoff, Magelhaes & Ram 2004). All samples were oven-dried
    at 70C for at least 72 h to determine dry leaf mass.

  methods: 'Naturally occurring saplings with an initial height of 40â€“120 cm were selected across as wide a range of light environments as possible, sampling along forest margins as well as within the forest stands. We selected the first plants we encountered that met our prerequisite of height. Stratified random sampling may have yielded measurements from saplings growing in a more normal distribution of light environments, but this would have been far more time-consuming and less efficient at determining light responses (as there would have been excessive sampling at intermediate light levels). We tagged at least 30 trees per species initially, though the final sample size is less than 30 in some cases due to either mortality or the inability to relocate saplings. For the species occurring on both soil types, we tagged 30 trees per species on each substrate. Two growth parameters were measured: height (measured as the vertical distance between the stem base and the base of the highest live meristem) and basal diameter (measured as the average of the diameter on two orthogonal axes 5 cm above the soil surface). Plants were remeasured at the end of the study period, which ranged from 12 to 16 months. Growth measurements were obtained to estimate light compensation points of growth for each species (Baltzer & Thomas 2007), following the specific methods of Lusk & Jorgensen (2013). This measure utilizes the positive relationship often seen between the light environment of individual plants and their relative growth rates (King 1991; Makana & Thomas 2005; Baltzer & Thomas 2007). The light level at which a plant experiences zero net growth (the compensation point) represents the point at which long-term gross carbon gain equals losses due to respiration, tissue turnover and herbivory. We used a non-destructive estimate of stem volume as a proxy for whole-plant biomas. (See manuscript for equation.)    ^p     A Nikon Coolpix digital camera with a 182Â° fisheye adapter was used to take hemispherical photographs above each individual. Photographs were taken when trees were tagged initially as well as when final growth measurements were made, and the average photosynthetic photon flux (PPFD) value was used in analyses to account for any changes in light regime over the course of the study. Photographs were analysed using the GAP LIGHT ANALYSER software package (Frazer, Canham & Lertzman 1999) to obtain the mean daily PPFD transmittance above each sapling. Cloudiness, spectral fraction and beam fraction were estimated using MODIS satellite photographs to quantify the frequency of cloud cover above our main worksites on basalt and rhyolite, during the 16-month study period. The Gap Light Analyser software inputs include these factors, as well as site latitude and date range of the study. Thus, our estimates of mean daily PPFD transmittance account for seasonal variation in sun angle and cloudiness. The 5th percentile of the range of PPFD (mean daily photon flux; mol m _2) measured for each species was used as an estimate of the minimum light level each species can tolerate (PPFD5; Table 2). Shade-tolerant species such as A. trifoliolatum have low PPFD5 values, while light-demanding species such as P. murrayi have high PPFD5 values.'

Growth measurements were obtained to estimate light compensation points of growth for each species (Baltzer & Thomas 2007), following the specific methods of Lusk & Jorgensen (2013). This measure utilizes the positive relationship often seen between the light environment of individual plants and their relative growth rates (King 1991; Makana & Thomas 2005; Baltzer & Thomas 2007). The light level at which a plant experiences zero net growth (the compensation point) represents the point at which long-term gross carbon gain equals losses due to respiration, tissue turnover and herbivory. We used a non-destructive estimate of stem volume as a proxy for whole-plant biomas. (See manuscript for equation.)    ^p     A Nikon Coolpix digital camera with a 182Â° fisheye adapter was used to take hemispherical photographs above each individual. Photographs were taken when trees were tagged initially as well as when final growth measurements were made, and the average photosynthetic photon flux (PPFD) value was used in analyses to account for any changes in light regime over the course of the study. Photographs were analysed using the GAP LIGHT ANALYSER software package (Frazer, Canham & Lertzman 1999) to obtain the mean daily PPFD transmittance above each sapling. Cloudiness, spectral fraction and beam fraction were estimated using MODIS satellite photographs to quantify the frequency of cloud cover above our main worksites on basalt and rhyolite, during the 16-month study period. The Gap Light Analyser software inputs include these factors, as well as site latitude and date range of the study. Thus, our estimates of mean daily PPFD transmittance account for seasonal variation in sun angle and cloudiness. The 5th percentile of the range of PPFD (mean daily photon flux; mol m _2) measured for each species was used as an estimate of the minimum light level each species can tolerate (PPFD5; Table 2). Shade-tolerant species such as A. trifoliolatum have low PPFD5 values, while light-demanding species such as P. murrayi have high PPFD5 values.'

  methods:  'Naturally occurring saplings with an initial height of 40â€“120 cm were selected across as wide a range of light environments as possible, sampling along forest margins as well as within the forest stands. We selected the first plants we encountered that met our prerequisite of height. Stratified random sampling may have yielded measurements from saplings growing in a more normal distribution of light environments, but this would have been far more time-consuming and less efficient at determining light responses (as there would have been excessive sampling at intermediate light levels). We tagged at least 30 trees per species initially, though the final sample size is less than 30 in some cases due to either mortality or the inability to relocate saplings. For the species occurring on both soil types, we tagged 30 trees per species on each substrate.

  contributors: In the manuscript the locations are given as 28deg63'S 153deg36'E
    and 28deg64'S 153deg34'E. These don't make sense, since there should only be 60
    minutes - I assumed they are actually in decimal degree format - i.e. 28.63, 153.36
    and these value plot more logically. Am I correct?
