  description: field data in northern NSW looking at the trade-off between juvenile
    growth potential vs shade tolerance
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: sapling
  sampling_strategy: We aimed to sample subsets of species that represented the range
    of shade tolerance and growth rates present in old-growth assemblages on the two
    substrates (Table 2). To this end, we selected the most abundant of those tree
    species that were well-represented by juveniles in shaded understories (e.g. Argyrodendron
    trifoliolatum and Castanospermum australe on basalt, Elaeocarpus sedentarius on
    rhyolite), as well as the most common of those regenerating mainly on recently
    disturbed open sites (e.g. Polyscias murrayi on basalt, Callicoma serratifolia
    on rhyolite), and some that were common in intermediate-light environments (e.g.
    Diploglottis australis on basalt, Austrobuxus swainii on rhyolite). Previous work
    has confirmed the existence of a wide range of shade tolerance in assemblages
    on basalt (Lusk et al. 2010), but less is known about the light requirements of
    species associated with rhyolite. Our selection included one generalist species
    that was fairly common on both substrates (Sarcopteryx stipata).

    description: 'The study was carried out in Nightcap National Park (NSW, Australia),
      which has a subtropical climate with high rainfall in the summer and autumn,
      and a short dry season in winter. Mean annual rainfall at the nearest meteorological
      station (Whian Whian) is estimated at 2300 mm and mean annual temperature at

      The first stand at Nightcap Range Road is associated with rhyolite soil, while
      the second stand at Rocky Creek Dam grows on basalt soil. The basalt soils are
      deeper and more fertile, containing much higher levels of phosphorus than rhyolite
      soils, as well as a significantly lower C : N ratio. As a result of this difference
      in resource availability, the forest communities are quite different. Stands
      on basalt are much more species-rich, while stands on rhyolite are relatively
      low in complexity and often dominated by just a few species (Royer et al. 2009).
      We chose sites on each substrate with little relief to ensure that drainage
      and water availability did not vary much between comparisons.'

  methods: Specific leaf area (SLA) was calculated using one fully expanded leaf or
    leaflet harvested from the outer portion of the crown of each individual tagged
    for growth measurements. For individuals used for gas exchange measurements, the
    leaf or leaflet measured was marked to ensure that it was collected for SLA. Leaves
    were scanned and the projected area was determined using the image-processing
    software ImageJ (Abramoff, Magelhaes & Ram 2004). All samples were oven-dried

  methods: 'Naturally occurring saplings with an initial height of 40-120 cm were
    selected across as wide a range of light environments as possible, sampling along
    forest margins as well as within the forest stands. We selected the first plants
    we encountered that met our prerequisite of height. Stratified random sampling
    may have yielded measurements from saplings growing in a more normal distribution
    of light environments, but this would have been far more time-consuming and less
    efficient at determining light responses (as there would have been excessive sampling
    at intermediate light levels). We tagged at least 30 trees per species initially,
    though the final sample size is less than 30 in some cases due to either mortality
    or the inability to relocate saplings. For the species occurring on both soil
    types, we tagged 30 trees per species on each substrate. Two growth parameters
    were measured: height (measured as the vertical distance between the stem base
    and the base of the highest live meristem) and basal diameter (measured as the
    average of the diameter on two orthogonal axes 5 cm above the soil surface). Plants
    were remeasured at the end of the study period, which ranged from 12 to 16 months.
    Growth measurements were obtained to estimate light compensation points of growth
    for each species (Baltzer & Thomas 2007), following the specific methods of Lusk
    & Jorgensen (2013). This measure utilizes the positive relationship often seen
    between the light environment of individual plants and their relative growth rates
    (King 1991; Makana & Thomas 2005; Baltzer & Thomas 2007). The light level at which
    a plant experiences zero net growth (the compensation point) represents the point
    at which long-term gross carbon gain equals losses due to respiration, tissue
    turnover and herbivory. We used a non-destructive estimate of stem volume as a
    proxy for whole-plant biomas. (See manuscript for equation.)    ^p     A Nikon
    Coolpix digital camera with a 182 deg fisheye adapter was used to take hemispherical
    photographs above each individual. Photographs were taken when trees were tagged
    initially as well as when final growth measurements were made, and the average
    photosynthetic photon flux (PPFD) value was used in analyses to account for any
    changes in light regime over the course of the study. Photographs were analysed
    using the GAP LIGHT ANALYSER software package (Frazer, Canham & Lertzman 1999)
    to obtain the mean daily PPFD transmittance above each sapling. Cloudiness, spectral
    fraction and beam fraction were estimated using MODIS satellite photographs to
    quantify the frequency of cloud cover above our main worksites on basalt and rhyolite,
    during the 16-month study period. The Gap Light Analyser software inputs include
    these factors, as well as site latitude and date range of the study. Thus, our
    estimates of mean daily PPFD transmittance account for seasonal variation in sun
    angle and cloudiness. The 5th percentile of the range of PPFD (mean daily photon
    flux; mol m _2) measured for each species was used as an estimate of the minimum
    light level each species can tolerate (PPFD5; Table 2). Shade-tolerant species
    such as A. trifoliolatum have low PPFD5 values, while light-demanding species
    such as P. murrayi have high PPFD5 values.'

  methods: 'Naturally occurring saplings with an initial height of 40-120 cm were
    selected across as wide a range of light environments as possible, sampling along
    forest margins as well as within the forest stands. We selected the first plants
    we encountered that met our prerequisite of height. Stratified random sampling
    may have yielded measurements from saplings growing in a more normal distribution
    of light environments, but this would have been far more time-consuming and less
    efficient at determining light responses (as there would have been excessive sampling
    at intermediate light levels). We tagged at least 30 trees per species initially,
    though the final sample size is less than 30 in some cases due to either mortality
    or the inability to relocate saplings. For the species occurring on both soil
    types, we tagged 30 trees per species on each substrate. Two growth parameters
    were measured: height (measured as the vertical distance between the stem base
    and the base of the highest live meristem) and basal diameter (measured as the
    average of the diameter on two orthogonal axes 5 cm above the soil surface). Plants
    were remeasured at the end of the study period, which ranged from 12 to 16 months.
    Growth measurements were obtained to estimate light compensation points of growth
    for each species (Baltzer & Thomas 2007), following the specific methods of Lusk
    & Jorgensen (2013). This measure utilizes the positive relationship often seen
    between the light environment of individual plants and their relative growth rates
    (King 1991; Makana & Thomas 2005; Baltzer & Thomas 2007). The light level at which
    a plant experiences zero net growth (the compensation point) represents the point
    at which long-term gross carbon gain equals losses due to respiration, tissue
    turnover and herbivory. We used a non-destructive estimate of stem volume as a
    proxy for whole-plant biomas. (See manuscript for equation.)    ^p     A Nikon
    Coolpix digital camera with a 182 deg fisheye adapter was used to take hemispherical
    photographs above each individual. Photographs were taken when trees were tagged
    initially as well as when final growth measurements were made, and the average
    photosynthetic photon flux (PPFD) value was used in analyses to account for any
    changes in light regime over the course of the study. Photographs were analysed
    using the GAP LIGHT ANALYSER software package (Frazer, Canham & Lertzman 1999)
    to obtain the mean daily PPFD transmittance above each sapling. Cloudiness, spectral
    fraction and beam fraction were estimated using MODIS satellite photographs to
    quantify the frequency of cloud cover above our main worksites on basalt and rhyolite,
    during the 16-month study period. The Gap Light Analyser software inputs include
    these factors, as well as site latitude and date range of the study. Thus, our
    estimates of mean daily PPFD transmittance account for seasonal variation in sun
    angle and cloudiness. The 5th percentile of the range of PPFD (mean daily photon
    flux; mol m _2) measured for each species was used as an estimate of the minimum
    light level each species can tolerate (PPFD5; Table 2). Shade-tolerant species
    such as A. trifoliolatum have low PPFD5 values, while light-demanding species
    such as P. murrayi have high PPFD5 values.'
