  description: Study investigating species' germination proportions and speeds in
    arid NT environment
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: seedling
  sampling_strategy: Seeds were collected from an area within 100 km of Alice Springs,
    Northern Territory (23deg 42min S, 133deg 52min E), from as many individuals of
    each species as possible. Seed collection was restricted by availability in the
    field during collecting trips between November 1987 and March 1989. Within the
    first 4 weeks after collection seeds were dried at 50 deg C for 24 h. Seeds were
    then stored at ambient temperature for 2 months to allow for after-ripening. Seeds
    collected and handled in this manner were used for all species except for two
    Acacias and a grass (see Appendix) that were found in sufficient numbers in an
    existing seed collection. Germination trials determined total per cent germination
    and rate of germination for each species at three constant temperatures (28 deg
    C, 20 deg C and 12 deg C). Seeds were germinated in petri dishes on filter paper
    with distilled water. They were kept in the dark except for approximately 20 min
    of light per day when germination was counted.

  methods: Germinability was expressed as a percentage of viable seeds that germinated
    after 10 days. A period of 10 days was used to approximate the germination expected
    in response to a single large rainfall. Germination was defined as the time of
    emergence of an embryo through the seed coat. This was checked daily and all germinated
    seedlings were removed. Seed viability was estimated before each germination trial,
    as well as for ungerminated seeds after trials, using the standard tetrazolium
    test (Moore 1962). At least 100 viable seeds per species were used at each temperature,
    in three to five petri dishes. For all species, whole diaspores (i.e. dispersal
    units) were germinated initially. If germination after 10 days was < 20% for all
    temperatures, a new set of seeds was removed from their dispersal structures (graminoids
    and forbs) or scarified with sand paper (seeds with hard coats). Some graminoids
    and forbs required scarification after separation from the dispersal structures
    to achieve 20% germination.

  contextual: Note to Austraits, we will be adding "germination temperature" as a
    contextual variable.
