  description: Study investigating relationships between root morphology, level of
    stored non-structural carbohydrates and post-fire regeneration strategy in 37
    Australian alpine plant species.
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: adult juvenile
  sampling_strategy: This research was undertaken on the Mt Reynard Plateau within
    Victoria's Alpine National Park (Fig. 1). In January 1998, following severe drought,
    a wildfire termed the Caledonia Fire had burnt the Mt Reynard Plateau for the
    first time since 1967. Three years later, grassland species were regenerating
    vigorously across the plateau, assisted by summer rainfall close to the estimated
    long-term average. ^p Plant sampling ^p During January 2001 (mid-summer), samples
    of root tissue were taken from 37 perennial monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous
    grassland species common on the plateau (Table 1), including small shrubs scattered
    within the grassland. Most species were in flower, allowing accurate identification,
    and were assumed to be at a similar phenological stage. All samples were taken
    from an area regenerating after the Caledonia Fire 3 years previously, and so
    reseeding species were 3 years old or younger, while resprouting species had regenerated
    from basal or root buds. No plants were more than 30 cm high. Collection of root
    material occurred between 1200 and 1400 hours on days of similar weather condition
    (sunny, and ~20°C). Three plants of each species were gently levered out of the
    ground sufficiently to characterise their root morphology and average maximum
    root diameter. The samples from the three plants of each species were pooled,
    wrapped in aluminium foil, frozen (-10°C) on return from the field (within 2-3
    h), then transferred to a -80°C freezer before freeze-drying.

    the Caledonia Fire (see McCarthy et al. 2000).
locations:
  Mt Reynard Plateau:
    latitude (deg): -37.398
    longitude (deg): 146.716
    elevation (m): 1700
    locality: Alpine National Park
    precipitation, MAP (mm): 1100
    description: The area is below the altitudinal tree limit of ~1830 m at this latitude
      (Costin 1970), but most of the plateau is treeless and the vegetation is considered
      alpine, as local temperatures fall as low as -15°C in winter (Tolsma 2002).
      Average daily minimum and maximum temperatures are ~7°C and 22°C respectively
      in February (summer), and -4°C and 6°C in July (winter) (Tolsma 2002). The vegetation
      on Mt Reynard comprises low shrublands, heathlands and herb-rich grasslands,
      with herbaceous members of the Asteraceae family making a major contribution
      to the latter.

    transferred to a -80°C freezer before freeze-drying. ^p Extraction of soluble
    carbohydrates ^p Preliminary analyses using thin-layer chromatography (Chiba and
    Shimomura 1965) and HCl-resorcinol assays (McRary and Slattery 1945) determined
    that soluble carbohydrates in a cross-section of alpine species separated almost
    entirely into two discrete groups -- ethanol-soluble, low-molecular-weight sugars
    comigrating with sucrose, glucose and fructose, and water-soluble fructans of
    a high degree of polymerisation (DP) almost immobile on chromatography (Tolsma
    2002). Therefore, a two-stage extraction process was developed. For each species,
    a freeze-dried and coarsely ground subsample of roots of ~200 mg DW was suspended
    in 10 mL of ethanol (80%), and homogenised with an Ultra-Turrax T25 homogeniser
    at 13-500 rpm. Homogenised suspensions were transferred to screw-top polypropylene
    centrifuge tubes, placed in a 60°C water bath for 15 min with occasional shaking,
    then centrifuged (2250g, 10 min) and the supernatant decanted. The pellet was
    re-extracted in 10 mL of 80% ethanol (60°C, 15 min) and the two supernatants pooled
    as ethanol-soluble carbohydrates (ES). The pellet was then extracted twice in
    10 mL distilled water (95°C, 15 min), centrifuged (2250g, 10 min), and the two
    aqueous supernatants pooled as water-soluble carbohydrates (WS). Both types of
    extracts were diluted to 20-80 ug mL-1 carbohydrate before analysis. ^p Soluble
    carbohydrate analysis ^p Analysis of soluble carbohydrates (ES and WS) was performed
    according to the phenol-sulfuric acid method (Dubois et al. 1956) modified to
    use 18% (w/v) rather than 5% (w/v) phenol (Buysse and Merckx 1993), a modification
    that gave the same colour yields at 490 nm for pentose and hexose sugars. Samples
    (0.5 mL) were analysed in triplicate and compared with a standard curve produced
    for 0-100 ug mL-1 glucose at 490 nm.

    re-extracted in 10 mL of 80% ethanol (60°C, 15 min) and the two supernatants pooled
    as ethanol-soluble carbohydrates (ES). The pellet was then extracted twice in
    10 mL distilled water (95°C, 15 min), centrifuged (2250g, 10 min), and the two
    aqueous supernatants pooled as water-soluble carbohydrates (WS). Both types of
    extracts were diluted to 20-80 ug mL-1 carbohydrate before analysis. ^p Starch
    analysis ^p Material insoluble in ethanol and water was resuspended in 12 mL distilled
    water, heated (121°C, 160 min with occasional shaking) to gelatinise the starch
    (Stitt et al. 1978), cooled and made up to 12 mL with distilled water. Triplicate
    2 mL aliquots of each suspension were each digested by addition of a mixture of
    0.4 mg (5.6 units) amyloglucosidase (glucan 1,4-a-glucosidase EC 3.2.1.3; Sigma
    A7420, from Aspergillus niger) and 0.4 ug (0.4 units) a-amylase (EC 3.2.1.1; Sigma
    A2643, from porcine pancreas) in 2 mL 0.2 M sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.8). Triplicate
    no-enzyme controls were also prepared. Samples were incubated (37°C, 120 min)
    then centrifuged (2250g, 10 min), and glucose release was measured with a glucose
    detection kit (Sigma, Kit 510-A) and compared with a standard curve produced for
    0-100 ug mL-1 glucose. Mean no-enzyme values for each sample were subtracted from
    the mean enzyme values to give the amount of glucose liberated from starch as
    amylase-soluble carbohydrate (AS). ^p Soluble carbohydrate analysis ^p Analysis
    of soluble carbohydrates (ES and WS) was performed according to the phenol-sulfuric
    acid method (Dubois et al. 1956) modified to use 18% (w/v) rather than 5% (w/v)
    phenol (Buysse and Merckx 1993), a modification that gave the same colour yields
    at 490 nm for pentose and hexose sugars. Samples (0.5 mL) were analysed in triplicate
    and compared with a standard curve produced for 0-100 ug mL-1 glucose at 490 nm.
    The sum of ES, WS and AS carbohydrates was calculated, to give total non-structural
    carbohydrates (NSC).
