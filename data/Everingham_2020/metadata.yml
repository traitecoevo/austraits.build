  description: Seed and seedling trait measurements from resurrected historic seeds
    and compared these with modern seed and seedling traits collected from the same
    species in the same geographic location to understand trait responses to climate
    through time.
  collection_type: field, glasshouse
  sample_age_class: seedling, adult
  sampling_strategy: "To determine if plant traits have changed within a species over
    time, we compared historic and modern accessions of seeds of 43 native Australian
    plant species from regions in south-eastern Australia which have experience differing
    levels of climatic change (Fig. 1). Many plant species have large geographic ranges,
    and plant traits often vary according to factors such as biotic interactions,
    altitude, latitude, soil fertility, and climate (Pakeman et al. 2008, Gong et
    al. 2020). Rather than spanning the full suite of variation within each species,
    our replicates are comparisons of tightly matched historic and modern population
    of plants. The level of within-population sampling (around 50 species) is substantially
    higher than the minimum (2-10 individuals) or preferred (5-25 individuals) number
    of replicates generally recommended for across-species studies of plant traits
    (Cornelissen et al. 2003). Paired modern and historic seeds were all collected
    from species that occurred in low elevation, non-alpine/mountainous sites to avoid
    confounding changes in elevation (elevation differences were always minimal, <100
    m) with changes in traits over time. ^p Historic seeds were a random sample of
    ex situ stored seeds obtained from long-term collections at two Australian seed
    banks (PlantBank, The Australian Botanic Gardens Mount Annan; and The Australian
    National Botanic Gardens seed bank). Following the typical protocol of historic
    seed collections (Langkamp 1987), we assumed that historic seeds were collected
    from multiple individual plants (at least five, however, usually more than 50).
    At the time of their collection, historic seeds were typically dried out to 15
    % relative humidity (RH) and kept in various storage conditions including cold
    rooms (-20 deg C) cool rooms (4 deg C) and drying rooms (ambient temperature).
    Our selection criteria were that the species were at least 30 years old (our range
    was 32 years to 46 years old); had at least five viable seeds in the collection;
    had accurate collection data; and were collected from wild populations.\t^p We
    aimed to minimise differences between collection and processing of modern and
    historic seeds. To minimise geographic bias, we collected modern seeds as close
    as possible, typically at the same location or within 1 km (however for five species,
    the seeds were collected within a larger radius) of the recorded historic seed
    collection and from 50 individual plants. These modern seeds either originated
    from modern collections at the Australian Botanic Garden, Mt Annan, were supplied
    by Nindethana and Eyre Native Seeds, South Australia, or collected in the wild
    by author S.E.E. All modern seeds were collected when they were ripe, and before
    being shed from the mother plant. Modern seeds were then dried for two weeks at
    15 deg C and 15% relative humidity and stored in the corresponding conditions
    of the historic seeds for one month to reduce the effect of storage environment.
    To minimise effects of seasonality, modern seeds were collected as close as possible
    to the same time of year as their historic counterparts. For 26 of the 43 species,
    collections were made within a month of the historic collection date and for another
    four species collections were made within 38 days. For the remaining 13 species,
    logistical limitations meant that we were unable to closely match the collection
    dates (> 38 days). However, the timing of collection had no effect on the changes
    in traits between the species (p > 0.05 for every trait, see Appendix 3, Table
    S1) and is disregarded from further analysis. ^p A random sample of 50 germinated
    historic and 50 germinated modern seeds were transferred onto soil in 24-celled
    4 cm by 2 cm2 trays with plastic dome lids to reduce moisture loss. After two
    weeks of growth seedlings were transferred to individual 1.9 L pots. All historic
    and modern seedlings were grown under the same conditions arranged in randomised
    blocks and re-randomised at monthly intervals to minimise possible positional
    effects during growth. Potting soil comprised 33% Australian Native Landscape
    supply of \"Organic Garden Mix\", 33% washed river sand and 33% Cocopeat. Throughout
    growth we added a general, slow release fertiliser containing nitrogen and phosphorus
    applied at c. 200 mL of fertiliser per 75 L of soil. All plants were grown with
    adequate water supplied by overhead sprinklers and ambient light conditions in
    a glasshouse at UNSW, Sydney."

    16-Nov, 8-Nov, are rekeyed as having occurred on the first of the month, so that
    all cells have the same formatting. That is 16-Dec becomes 01-December-2016.

    leaves was measured by weighing on a microbalance(Mettler Toledo AG204-microbalance,
    1 x 10-4 accuracy). LMA was calculated as oven-dry mass divided by fresh area.
- var_in: Stem Density (g/mL)
  unit_in: mg/mm3
  trait_name: stem_density
  value_type: raw_value
  replicates: 1
  methods: Fresh volume of the stem was calculated using the water displacement method
    (Perez-Harguindeguy et al. 2013). Stem sections were dried at 60 deg C for 72
    hr in a drying oven and weighed. Specific stem density was calculated as the ratio
    of oven dry stem mass (g) to the fresh volume of the stem (mL).
- var_in: Germination %
  unit_in: '%'
  trait_name: germination
  value_type: site_mean
  replicates: 50-100
  methods: Where enough seeds were available, we germinated 100 historic and 100 modern
    seeds of each species on agar in incubators, for two weeks or until the cotyledon
    had appeared in at least 90 % of the germinated seeds. Most species (35 out of
    43) were germinated on water agar (7 % weight per volume) at 20 deg C at constant
    humidity and alternating 12-hour light/dark conditions. However, eight species
    required specific germination regimes and these treatments were kept constant
    within each species, between historic and modern accessions (details in Appendix
    3, Table S2). Every two days, the number of germinated seeds was recorded. A cut
    test with subsequent microscopic analysis were carried out to determine seed viability
    and seed dormancy at the end of the germination tests. Seed germination success
    was measured as the percent of seeds that germinated after the incubation period
    and was corrected excluding non-germinated, empty seeds. Seed viability was recorded
    as a binary trait (viable/non-viable) recorded for each individual seed at the
    end of the incubation period. For nine species all seeds of modern and/or historic
    accessions were 100 % non-viable and data for these species is limited to seed
    mass and seed shape.

  unit_in: umolCO2/m2/s
  trait_name: photosynthetic_rate_per_area_saturated
  value_type: individual_mean
  replicates: 5
  methods: Seeds were then germinated under controlled conditions and when they reached
    seedling age, were transferred to trays made up of 24-cells each measuring in
    2x2 cm cells. The seedlings grew for two weeks in the trays to ensure early seedling
    survival before being transferred to individual 1.9 L pots. Potting soil comprised
    of 33% Australian Native Landscape supply of "Organic Garden Mix", 33% washed
    river sand and 33% Cocopeat as well as a general slow-release fertiliser added
    at 200 mL per 75 L of soil. Plants were grown in a glasshouse at UNSW, Sydney
    for six months with an overhead irrigation system. Pots were randomised each month
    to reduce position effects. To obtain photosynthetic measurements we used portable
    infrared gas analysers (Licor 6400XT, Lincoln, Nebraska) on well-watered, non-root-bound,
    non-flowering individuals. We randomly selected a subset of ten historic plants
    and ten modern plants from each species. Some species had less than ten plants
    available, and some species were excluded from photosynthetic measurements because
    their leaves were not large enough to fit into the gas chamber without damage
    to the majority of the seedling (for species and sample sizes see Supplementary
    Information, Appendix S2). We took infrared gas measurements on the youngest fully
    expanded leaf following standard protocols [56]. Our measurements were made under
    saturating light conditions (1800 umol m-2 s-1), with chamber CO2 set at 400ppm
    and chamber temperature set at 25 deg C. We took five consecutive measurements
    two seconds apart and used the average. We recorded photosynthetic rate (Asat;
    umol CO2 m-2 s-1) derived from photosynthesis equations by von Caemmerer and Farquhar
    [57]. We also recorded stomatal conductance (gs; mmol H2O m-2 s-1).

    et al., (2013). We measured plant height from the top of the soil to the tip of
    the tallest apical meristem on each plant. All shoot tissue was harvested at the
    level of the soil and all plant roots were individually harvested and washed using
    distilled water. Roots and shoots were separated, dried at 60 deg C for 72 hr,
