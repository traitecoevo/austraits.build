  description: Wood and stem density data from Kate Hughes for 51 species. Collected
    while at Macquarie University.
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: STUDY SITES Species were sampled during 2004 and 2005 from four
    sites (Table 1) used also by Pickup et al. 2005. Two sites at contrasted soil
    nutrient levels were in a high rainfall zone (Strickland State Forest, on the
    New South Wales central coast) and another pair of sites in a low rainfall zone
    (Round Hill Nature Reserve, central-western N.S.W). WOOD SAMPLES The plant species
    used (listed in Table 2) were the most abundant at each site. In order to obtain
    comparable twigs across species, a xylem conductive area of 10 mm2 and a twig
    containing this area (4-5 mm over-bark diameter) was taken from four individuals
    of each species, from a branch in full sunlight from the upper canopy. The twigs
    were stored in airtight plastic bags, transported to the lab in a cooler, refrigerated
    and processed, usually within 72 h of collection.

  methods: The wood density (dry mass per fresh volume) of a 2.5 cm segment of the

    described in Hacke, Sperry and Pittermann (2000).

  methods: Sector area sampled. XYLEM ANATOMY Transverse sections of the twigs 30-50
    um thick were cut with a sliding microtome at a conductive cross-sectional area
    of 10 mm2 and stained with toluidine blue. Micrographs of a representative cross-section
    for each plant were taken using a CCD video camera attached to a light microscope.
    At least four radial sectors approximately equally-spaced around the circumference
    of the twig were imaged at 100X magnification. The radial boundaries of sectors
    were defined by the middle of parenchyma rays to ensure appropriate representation
    of age classes of vessels within each sector and of contribution of rays to the
    stem. Inner and outer boundaries of radial sectors were defined by the pith and
    the vascular cambium. ^p Open spaces with major diameter less than 10 um were
    treated not as vessel lumen but rather assumed to be fibre lumen or other non-vessel
    lumen (as in Corcuera et al. 2004). Due to conductivity being proportional to
    the fourth power of conduit radius, even if any of these spaces below the 10 um
    cutoff had actually been vessels, their contribution to hydraulic conductivity
    would have been negligible. All open vessels in the cross-section were treated
    as capable of conducting water, which is reasonable given the young age of the
    twigs. ^p Using ImageJ software (v1.32j, NIH, USA), three image-analysis steps
    were undertaken for each sector. First the total area of the sector was measured
    ('sector area'). Next, the total area not in cell wall was measured ('area of
    space'); this included fibre and tracheid lumens as well as vessel lumens, and
    any empty parenchyma cells. Finally, we measured the total area of vessels ('vessel
    lumen area') and dimensions of individual vessels. Although some species had very
    low vessel densities, usually a minimum of 200 vessels per cross section were
    measured.

    would have been negligible. All open vessels in the cross-section were treated
    as capable of conducting water, which is reasonable given the young age of the
    twigs. ^p Using ImageJ software (v1.32j, NIH, USA), three image-analysis steps
    were undertaken for each sector. First the total area of the sector was measured
    ('sector area'). Next, the total area not in cell wall was measured ('area of
    space'); this included fibre and tracheid lumens as well as vessel lumens, and
    any empty parenchyma cells. Finally, we measured the total area of vessels ('vessel
    lumen area') and dimensions of individual vessels. Although some species had very
    low vessel densities, usually a minimum of 200 vessels per cross section were
    measured.

  methods: Estimated density of non-vessel lumen was found by dividing the wood density
    by (1 / fraction vessel lumen). Similarly, estimated density of solid material
    within the non-lumen fraction ('estimated density of non-space') was found by
    dividing wood density by (1 / fraction space). (OVERALL XYLEM ANATOMY METHODS
    Transverse sections of the twigs 30-50 um thick were cut with a sliding microtome
    at a conductive cross-sectional area of 10 mm2 and stained with toluidine blue.
    Micrographs of a representative cross-section for each plant were taken using
    a CCD video camera attached to a light microscope.  At least four radial sectors
    approximately equally-spaced around the circumference of the twig were imaged
    at 100X magnification. The radial boundaries of sectors were defined by the middle
    of parenchyma rays to ensure appropriate representation of age classes of vessels
    within each sector and of contribution of rays to the stem. Inner and outer boundaries
    of radial sectors were defined by the pith and the vascular cambium. ^p Open spaces
    with major diameter less than 10 um were treated not as vessel lumen but rather
    assumed to be fibre lumen or other non-vessel lumen (as in Corcuera et al. 2004).
    Due to conductivity being proportional to the fourth power of conduit radius,
    even if any of these spaces below the 10 um cutoff had actually been vessels,
    their contribution to hydraulic conductivity would have been negligible. All open
    vessels in the cross-section were treated as capable of conducting water, which
    is reasonable given the young age of the twigs. ^p Using ImageJ software (v1.32j,
    NIH, USA), three image-analysis steps were undertaken for each sector. First the
    total area of the sector was measured ('sector area'). Next, the total area not
    in cell wall was measured ('area of space'); this included fibre and tracheid
    lumens as well as vessel lumens, and any empty parenchyma cells. Finally, we measured
    the total area of vessels ('vessel lumen area') and dimensions of individual vessels.
