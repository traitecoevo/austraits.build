  description: An investigation of seed longevity patterns in 12 shrub and two graminoid
    species in fire-prone habitats around Sydney, south-eastern Australia.
  basis_of_record: field_experiment
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: Sites were located in the Sydney region (33°53'S, 151°13'E) of
    southeastern Australia in open heath to open forest (Specht 1970) on soils derived
    from Hawkesbury Sandstone. All sites had an understorey dominated by shrubs, sedges
    and grasses. Annual precipitation for Sydney is about 1300 mm, while the average
    monthly maximum/minimum temperatures are 26/18°C in summer and 16/8°C in winter.
    The 14 species studied included a grass, a sedge and small to large shrubs, comprising
    a component of the understorey of sclerophyllous heaths, woodlands and forests
    in south-east Australia (see Table 1 for species, authorities and threat status).
    ^p Seed collection ^p Seeds were collected during spring and summer of 1990 by
    hand from mature fruits, from cloth bags placed around maturing fruits or from
    the soil surface below parent plants (Persoonia pinifolia only). At each site,
    seeds were collected opportunistically from as many individuals as possible and
    pooled within each species. Sites were located to the north or south of Sydney.

  methods: For all species, levels of seed dormancy and viability were assessed in
    an initial germination trial. These comprised four replicates of 25 seeds placed
    in 9-cm-diameter petri dishes on Whatman Grade 2 filter paper with added distilled
    water. For Persoonia pinifolia, sufficient seeds were only available for three
    replicates of 10 seeds. Seeds that germinated were considered to be in a non-dormant
    state. Seeds that did not germinate were tested for viability by the tetrazolium
    test (Lakon 1949) and scored as viable if stained or if white and firm, except
    for Grevillea spp. and Kunzea spp. Seeds of Grevillea spp. were scarified and
    then allowed to germinate. If these seeds did not subsequently germinate they
    were then tested for viability with tetrazolium. Seeds were scored as viable if
    they were white and firm or if they stained under tetrazolium. Seeds of Kunzea
    spp. were soaked in distilled water and examined under a binocular microscope.
    Seeds were scored as viable if the endosperm was white and firm.

  methods: Seed burial trials were established for all 14 study species at the site
    of seed collection. For one species, Darwinia biflora, sufficient seeds were available
    at two sites separated by 2-3 km to replicate the burial trials. For each species,
    at each site, four plots were randomly located within the general area occupied
    by mature plants of that study species. Twelve mesh bags containing seeds of a
    species were buried in each plot. For Grevillea caleyi, seed availability limited
    replication to 10 bags per plot. The mesh bags were made from nylon, with a mesh
    size varying from 0.5 to 2 mm depending on seed size. It was assumed that the
    movement of soil moisture would not be affected by the mesh bags. Into each bag,
    a mixture of soil from the field and 20-50 seeds per species (see Table 1) were
    added. Soil was taken within 10 m of, but not from under parent plants, to avoid
    incorporation of seeds already in the soil. Throughout the study there was no
    evidence of any introduction of additional seeds into bags by this technique,
    except for a small number of seed into three replicate bags of Gahnia sieberiana.
    Bags were buried in the top 5 cm of the soil. The existing soil was removed and
    replaced with bags containing seeds and soil and these bags were then covered
    with part of the original soil. One bag was recovered from each replicate plot
    for each species every two months for a period of up to two years. When recovered,
    bags were returned to the laboratory and the contents removed and air dried. The
    contents were then searched for the presence of seeds or seed remains. The number
    of intact seeds recovered from each bag was recorded and these intact seeds were
    then examined for germinability and viability (see above). For Gahnia sieberiana,
    estimates of viability were only made for the first four time periods because
    of the difficulty of slicing seeds open. For this species, only the intact seed
    fraction is considered in the analysis.
