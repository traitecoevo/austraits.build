  description: A study that collates existing information from previous floristic surveys and the placement of stratified full vascular plant floristic sites be carried out in order to complete a comprehensive investigation of the vegetation and flora of Brigalow Park and Claremont NRs, with the intent that these findings can be used for management purposes.

  sampling_strategy: 1.2 Study area ^p Brigalow Park and Claremont Nature Reserves are found approximately 22 km by road south of Narrabri within the Brigalow Belt South Bioregion, the North Western Plains Botanical Division and the Narrabri Shire. Both reserves are surrounded by private land holdings which are extensively modified cropping or grazing landscapes (Plate 1). Brigalow Park incorporates 252 ha and Claremont contains 202 ha. Brigalow Park (202 ha) was dedicated in 1986 with Claremont following in 1987 and then an additional 50 ha of Brigalow regrowth was added to the north eastern corner of Brigalow Park in 1997. The average rainfall for the region is pproximately 660 mm with a summer maximum. Both reserves were prior to dedication under private ownership. The areas within the reserve were thought to have been pulled and cleared between 30 and 60 years ago (Pulsford 1984). Most of the surrounding landuse is of high intensity cropping and/or grazing, though some small remnants do extend beyond the boundary in at least some sections the reserves (Plate 1). ^p Little biological investigations of the reserves have taken place. A biodiversity field survey of Brigalow Park and Claremont Nature Reserves in 1996 (Bush 1996). The survey involved some floristic and fauna investigations, though the survey period followed very dry weather and a list of 60 flora species were recorded (Bush 1996). ^p 2.1 Survey design ^p The survey was carried out in a stratified random way in order to sample and replicate the major environmental changes. As the reserve is small and the number of sites placed was to be limited the number of strata chosen was small. Rock type and aspect were used in order to distribute sites within the landscape. ^p 2.2 Site and species information ^p Topological information was also collected along with measurements of altitude, slope, aspect and horizontal elevation. Altitude was taken directly from topographic maps. Slope and horizontal elevation were measured using a 'SUUNTO Optical Reading Clinometer'. Horizontal elevation was measured at eight equidistant compass bearings. Aspect was measured using a compass with reference to magnetic north. Information on soil, fires and other disturbances was also collected in a form amenable to the site survey data sheets supplied by the Glen Innes Area of the National Parks and Wildlife Service (Appendix A). Site location was derived from a Magellan Trailblazer XL GPS with reference to topographic maps. ^p Vegetation structure was derived using the system developed by Walker and Hopkins (1990). This method uses growth form, height and crown cover of the dominant taxa in each of the strata layers that are identifiable. Individual taxon data for each quadrat was recorded using the species data forms supplied by the Glen Innes Area of the National Parks and Wildlife Service (Appendix A).
