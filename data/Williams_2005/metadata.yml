  description: Study to examine the probability of extinction along an urban-rural
    gradient and how it is affected by plant traits.
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: STUDY AREA The remnant native temperate grasslands of western
    Victoria (south-east Australia) are dominated by the C4 tussock-forming grass
    Themeda triandra and contain distinct intertussock spaces that are occupied by
    a wide range of herbaceous species predominantly from the Asteraceae, Lilliaceae
    and Fabaceae (Patton 1935; Willis 1964; Morgan 1994). The species composition
    of the community is relatively similar over large areas, due to the same underlying
    basalt geology and similar climatic conditions. The area of native grassland in
    western Victoria prior to European settlement was approximately 800 000-1000 000
    ha (Barlow & Ross 2001) but extensive fragmentation by agriculture (Stuwe 1986)
    and urban development (Williams et al. 2005) has reduced the ecosystem to less
    than 0.5% of its original extent (Barlow & Ross 2001). It is now listed as critically
    endangered under State and Federal legislation. Remnants persist as small, isolated
    patches, often as linear strips along road and rail easements, both in urban Melbourne
    and in the rural agricultural landscapes of western Victoria.^p The 30 sites used
    for this study were distributed across a 225-km gradient from the inner suburbs
    of Melbourne, west through the fertile agricultural districts of western Victoria
    (Fig. 1). The degree of urbanization along our gradient was quantified by calculating
    the total length of roads within a 5-km radius (78.5 km2) of each site using the
    May 2000 Victorian state digital road network GIS layer and by calculating the
    distance of each site from Melbourne. This produced three distinct groups. Twelve
    sites were classified as rural, with less than 110 km of road (these were between
    93 km and 234 km from Melbourne), 12 as peri-urban (16-75 km from Melbourne and
    140-440 km of road within 5 km) and six as urban (10-16 km from Melbourne, 700
    km of road). INITIAL SURVEYS Lists of plant species were obtained for each of
    the 30 sites from records of comprehensive surveys conducted between 1979 and
    1991. Many of these surveys were conducted by La Trobe University botanists to
    assess rare plant populations in Victoria (Scarlett & Parsons 1981; Scarlett 1985),
    and others were undertaken as part of large-scale biological surveys of grassland
    remnants (Stuwe 1986). Surveyed patches were a mixture of railway and road reserves
    and small patches of public land such as cemeteries and unused recreation reserves.
    All sites remained as native grassland in 2001. 2001 SURVEYS Detailed locality
    notes and site maps from the initial surveys were used to confirm site identity,
    prior to comprehensive floristic surveys at all sites in spring and summer 2001.
    The same field staff and survey techniques were used to walk each patch, following
    a grid pattern and recording the presence of all vascular plants. Species not
    found in 2001 but reported prior to 1991 were considered locally extinct at that
    site. ^p False absences (i.e. recording a species as absent when it was in fact
    present) has been highlighted as a problem in similar local extinction studies
    (Fischer & Stocklin 1997; Kery 2004). We therefore restricted our study to small
    sites (mean size 4.5 ha) and surveyed each site on two occasions in order to record
    seasonal changes in the flora, particularly for species that are only conspicuous
    when flowering. We also ignored annual species and grasses of the genera Austrostipa
    and Austrodanthonia that are difficult to identify to species level without developed
    seed. Because of these precautions, as well as the linear shape of most of our
    sites, the low open structure of the grassland and the conspicuous nature of many
    of the flowering herbs, we are confident that if we did not record a species it
    was in fact absent from the site. Comparison of our 2001 surveys with the 1980s
    surveys indicate that we generally found an increased number of native species,
    suggesting that we had indeed minimized the recording of false absences. Although
    establishment was not surveyed, it is doubtful that those additional species recorded
    in 2001 were due to colonization from other patches of native grassland. Many
    grassland herbs lack specialized dispersal mechanisms (McIntyre et al. 1995; see
    supplementary Appendix S1) and those studied appear to disperse over only relatively
    short distances (i.e. < 1 m) (Morgan 1995). Given the relictual status of native
    grasslands and the substantial distances between most remnants, re-establishment
    following local extinction or immigration of new native species is unlikely. Recolonization
    from the soil seed bank is also rare as very few native grassland species form
    persistent seed banks (Morgan 1998b). PLANT TRAIT DATA Data for the following
    plant traits were compiled for the 181 species used in the analysis, lifeform,
    dispersal mechanism, presence or absence of vegetative reproduction, seed mass,
    presence or absence of persistent soil seed bank and prevalence of the species
    in the grassland flora of western Victoria. Data were also compiled for lifecycle
    and growth form but were omitted from the analyses due to correlations with one
    or more of the other species attributes. The traits selected have been shown to
    influence the local extinction of plants in response to disturbances such as grazing.
    Data were obtained, where possible, from published studies containing compilations
    of grassland plant traits (Tremont & McIntyre 1994; Tremont 1994; McIntyre et
    al. 1995). A table of trait data for all species identified in this study and
    the sources from which they were obtained is presented in Appendix S1.

  methods: Seed mass data were obtained from the literature and unpublished sources.
    Quantities of seed held by nurseries specializing in the propagation of Victorian
    grassland flora were weighed to obtain mean seed mass for some further species,
    so that seed mass data were available for 126 of the 166 species (76%) used in
    the analysis.

  unit_in: .na
  trait_name: soil_seedbank
  entity_type: species

  basis_of_value: expert_score
  replicates: .na
  methods: Data on the ability of seeds of each species to form a persistent soil
    seed bank were obtained from published studies of Australian grasslands or grassy
    woodlands. Because a number of these studies only recorded species present in
    the soil seed bank, a conservative interpretation of the data was used by which
    the seed bank of a species was only recorded as present or absent if specifically
    reported (i.e. non-reporting was not interpreted as absence). Where data from
    a number of authors were conflicting, the most common determination was used.
    Soil seed bank information was obtained for 99 of the 166 species (60%).

questions:
  contributor: Would it be appropriate to include Tremont_1994 and McIntyre_1995 as
    secondary references on this dataset? We don't currently have either in AusTraits.
  question2: In the data.csv file you'll see I've added a column that indicates which
    seed mass values are duplicates and the study with the duplicate. There is clearly
    a lot of overlap with all the datasets we have from John Morgan's lab. Is it a
    reasonable assumption that all these duplicates do represent the same observation?
    We also have lots of Angela Moles' datasets - it is odd that none are explicitly
    showing up as duplicates, but probably because we have raw values from her. I'll
    check that separately.
