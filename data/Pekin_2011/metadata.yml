      description: We chose a single landform unit (Collis, sensu Churchward et al. (1988)) at the southern extent of southwest Australia as our study area (Fig. 1) in order to ensure a consistent species pool across our study sites. The Collis landform displays yellow duplex soils on upland, nonwaterlogged terrain, and is dominated by jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata Donn ex Sm.) and marri (Corymbia calophylla Lindl.) trees in the overstorey and a dense shrub layer in the understorey (see Pekin et al. in press for details on floristics). Sixteen study sites with variable fire histories were selected for conducting floral surveys within this area (Fig. 1). The recent fire history (1972-2004) of each site was obtained from a database of digitized fire boundaries produced by the Western Australian Department of Environment and Conservation (DEC) (Hamilton et al. 2009). While the study sites had a mixed history of prescribed and wild fires, all sites were burnt by either a prescribed burn in late 2002 or a large wildfire, which burned through much of the study area in early 2003, and were not burned again prior to the time of floral surveys; hence, the last fire had occurred in the same fire season and the time since last fire was the same for all sites at the time of sampling (see Pekin et al. in press for details on fire history across the sites). In southwest Australia, the conservative interval between lethal fires has been suggested at twice the juvenile period of the slowest maturing obligate seeder (Burrows & Wardell-Johnson 2003), which corresponds to ~6 years in this ecosystem (Burrows et al. 2008). Consequently, sites for this study were selected to represent either two consecutive short fire intervals of up to 5 years (SS); two consecutive long fire intervals of 11 years or longer (LL); or mixed fire interval lengths (M) (Hamilton et al. 2009). The climate of southwest Australia is mediterranean, where most of the precipitation falls during winter and there is an extended drought over summer. Hence, even small changes in mean annual precipitation in this environment can strongly affect water stress for plants, and the regional distribution of plant species and vegetation types is primarily a function of water availability (Beard, 1983). Annual rainfall near the coast is ~1200mm but decreases sharply towards the northeast (Bureau of Meteorology 2008) with distance inland, even though the landscape is relatively flat. We obtained interpolated climatic data for the location of each of our sites for the past ~35 years (1970 to 2008) from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (2008). Local mean annual precipitation (P) was adjusted for elevation using BIOCLIM (Nix 1986), and mean annual potential evapotranspiration (PET) was calculated from an existing database of gridded climate variables (Jeffrey et al. 2001). Site aridity was quantified with an aridity index (AI = PET/P) and used as an indicator of moisture availability (Pekin et al. 2009). Our study area displays a relatively sharp gradient of increasing rainfall from ~850mmannually in the northeast to ~1100mmin the southwest across a distance of ~25km (Fig. 1). Thus, the aridity index across our sites is likely to reflect a significant variation in the availability of moisture for plants over the summer drought season.
  sampling_strategy: 'Floral surveys were conducted in the spring of 2007 from 4 to 26 October. A 30x30-m plot was established at each of the 16 sites. The abundance of each vascular plant species within each plot was estimated using the following classes: 1, 2-10, 11-50, 51-100, 101-500, or 4500 individuals. From these observations, two species composition matrices (presence/absence and abundance) were created with species as columns and sites as rows. The species abundance matrix used an integer code from 0 to 500, with each code corresponding to the mean abundance value of each abundance class, indicating the approximate abundance of each species at a given site. A ‘0’ was used to indicate an absence and a ‘1’ to indicate presence of a species at each site in the presence/absence matrix.'

  methods: Regeneration strategies were assigned according to the dominant method for regenerating after fire as either from (1) fleshy, underground storage organ (including bulbs, corms, rhizomes and tubers), (2) woody rootstock/lignotuber, or (3) seed, which was derived from the database developed by Burrows et al. (2008). Seeders included both obligate seeders as well as those species that primarily regenerate from seed but may also have the potential to resprout. Although the dominant tree species, E. marginata and C. calophylla, in our study sites often regenerate from seed, they can survive and resprout epicormically even after intense fires that result in full canopy scorch (Bell & Koch 1980). Hence, they were excluded from regeneration strategy classification because their ability to survive fires with their above-ground biomass intact is likely to make them insensitive to a depletion of their seed banks.
- var_in: Root structure
  unit_in: .na
  trait_name: root_structure
  value_type: expert opinion
  replicates: .na
  methods: Root structure classification was made either according to the known mycorrhizal root association of each species, or according to specialized non-mycorrhizal root types (Brundrett 2008); i.e. each species was classified as ectomycorrhizal, arbuscular mycorrhizal, orchid mycorrhizal, ericoid mycorrhizal, proteoid root or other non-mycorrhizal. Some species were variably described in the literature as both arbuscular mycorrhizal and nonmycorrhizal; where such conflicts arose, the species were classified as arbuscular mycorrhizal since they have the potential to form the association. Other non-mycorrhizal root species included rushes and sedges that are known for having capillaroid, dauciform or sand-binding roots, as well as a few carnivorous and parasitic plant species which are known not to form associations with mycorrhizal fungi (Brundrett & Abbott 1991; Brundrett 2008).

  methods: Classification for N-fixing ability was made either as fixer or non-fixer; all leguminous species formerly in the families Papilionaceae Giseke and Mimosaceae R.Br. (now both Fabaceae Lindl.), as well as one cycad species (Macrozamia riedlei Gaudich.) were classified as N-fixing.
