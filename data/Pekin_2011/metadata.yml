  description: Longevity, regeneration and mycorrhiza data for 125 species
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: Floral surveys were conducted in the spring of 2007 from 4 to
    26 October. A 30x30-m plot was established at each of the 16 sites. The abundance
    of each vascular plant species within each plot was estimated using the following
    classes- 1, 2-10, 11-50, 51-100, 101-500, or 4500 individuals. From these observations,
    two species composition matrices (presence/absence and abundance) were created
    with species as columns and sites as rows. The species abundance matrix used an
    integer code from 0 to 500, with each code corresponding to the mean abundance
    value of each abundance class, indicating the approximate abundance of each species
    at a given site. A '0' was used to indicate an absence and a '1' to indicate presence
    of a species at each site in the presence/absence matrix.

    description: Near the town of Walpole, WA. We chose a single landform unit (Collis, sensu Churchward et al.
      (1988)) at the southern extent of southwest Australia as our study area (Fig.
      1) in order to ensure a consistent species pool across our study sites. The
      Collis landform displays yellow duplex soils on upland, nonwaterlogged terrain,
      and is dominated by jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata Donn ex Sm.) and marri (Corymbia
      calophylla Lindl.) trees in the overstorey and a dense shrub layer in the understorey
      (see Pekin et al. in press for details on floristics). Sixteen study sites with
      variable fire histories were selected for conducting floral surveys within this
      area (Fig. 1). The recent fire history (1972-2004) of each site was obtained
      from a database of digitized fire boundaries produced by the Western Australian
      Department of Environment and Conservation (DEC) (Hamilton et al. 2009). While
      the study sites had a mixed history of prescribed and wild fires, all sites
      were burnt by either a prescribed burn in late 2002 or a large wildfire, which
      burned through much of the study area in early 2003, and were not burned again
      prior to the time of floral surveys; hence, the last fire had occurred in the
      same fire season and the time since last fire was the same for all sites at
      the time of sampling (see Pekin et al. in press for details on fire history
      across the sites). In southwest Australia, the conservative interval between
      lethal fires has been suggested at twice the juvenile period of the slowest
      maturing obligate seeder (Burrows & Wardell-Johnson 2003), which corresponds
      to ~6 years in this ecosystem (Burrows et al. 2008). Consequently, sites for
      this study were selected to represent either two consecutive short fire intervals
      of up to 5 years (SS); two consecutive long fire intervals of 11 years or longer
      (LL); or mixed fire interval lengths (M) (Hamilton et al. 2009). The climate
      of southwest Australia is mediterranean, where most of the precipitation falls
      during winter and there is an extended drought over summer. Hence, even small
      changes in mean annual precipitation in this environment can strongly affect
      water stress for plants, and the regional distribution of plant species and
      vegetation types is primarily a function of water availability (Beard, 1983).
      Annual rainfall near the coast is ~1200mm but decreases sharply towards the
      northeast (Bureau of Meteorology 2008) with distance inland, even though the
      landscape is relatively flat. We obtained interpolated climatic data for the
      location of each of our sites for the past ~35 years (1970 to 2008) from the
      Australian Bureau of Meteorology (2008). Local mean annual precipitation (P)
      was adjusted for elevation using BIOCLIM (Nix 1986), and mean annual potential
      evapotranspiration (PET) was calculated from an existing database of gridded
      climate variables (Jeffrey et al. 2001). Site aridity was quantified with an
      aridity index (AI = PET/P) and used as an indicator of moisture availability
      (Pekin et al. 2009). Our study area displays a relatively sharp gradient of
      increasing rainfall from ~850mmannually in the northeast to ~1100mmin the southwest
      across a distance of ~25km (Fig. 1). Thus, the aridity index across our sites
      is likely to reflect a significant variation in the availability of moisture
      for plants over the summer drought season.

traits:
- var_in: longevity
  unit_in: .na
  trait_name: life_history
  value_type: expert_mean
  replicates: .na
  methods: The life cycle of each species was defined as perennial or annual.
- var_in: Regeneration strategy
  unit_in: .na
  trait_name: regen_strategy
  value_type: expert_mean
  replicates: .na
  methods: Regeneration strategies were assigned according to the dominant method
    for regenerating after fire as either from (1) fleshy, underground storage organ
    (including bulbs, corms, rhizomes and tubers), (2) woody rootstock/lignotuber,
    or (3) seed, which was derived from the database developed by Burrows et al. (2008).
    Seeders included both obligate seeders as well as those species that primarily
    regenerate from seed but may also have the potential to resprout. Although the
    dominant tree species, E. marginata and C. calophylla, in our study sites often
    regenerate from seed, they can survive and resprout epicormically even after intense
    fires that result in full canopy scorch (Bell & Koch 1980). Hence, they were excluded
    from regeneration strategy classification because their ability to survive fires
    with their above-ground biomass intact is likely to make them insensitive to a
    depletion of their seed banks.
- var_in: Root structure
  unit_in: .na
  trait_name: root_structure
  value_type: expert_mean
  replicates: .na
  methods: Root structure classification was made either according to the known mycorrhizal
    root association of each species, or according to specialized non-mycorrhizal
    root types (Brundrett 2008); i.e. each species was classified as ectomycorrhizal,
    arbuscular mycorrhizal, orchid mycorrhizal, ericoid mycorrhizal, proteoid root
    or other non-mycorrhizal. Some species were variably described in the literature
    as both arbuscular mycorrhizal and nonmycorrhizal; where such conflicts arose,
    the species were classified as arbuscular mycorrhizal since they have the potential
    to form the association. Other non-mycorrhizal root species included rushes and
    sedges that are known for having capillaroid, dauciform or sand-binding roots,
    as well as a few carnivorous and parasitic plant species which are known not to
    form associations with mycorrhizal fungi (Brundrett & Abbott 1991; Brundrett 2008).
- var_in: N_fixer
  unit_in: .na
  trait_name: nitrogen_fixing
  value_type: expert_mean
  replicates: .na
  methods: Classification for N-fixing ability was made either as fixer or non-fixer;
    all leguminous species formerly in the families Papilionaceae Giseke and Mimosaceae
    R.Br. (now both Fabaceae Lindl.), as well as one cycad species (Macrozamia riedlei
    Gaudich.) were classified as N-fixing.
