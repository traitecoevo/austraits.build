  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: 'Sampling strategy for worldwide paper: Leaf trait data were
    compiled from both published and unpublished sources. A data set was considered
    suitable provided it contained data for at least two of the leaf traits for at
    least four co-occurring species. Highly artificial vegetation types such as forestry
    plantations and crop fields were not included. Only site-based data sets were
    used so that we could reasonably attach climate data. The total data set (Supplementary
    Information) represented 175 sites and contained 2,548 species–site combinations,
    consisting of 2,021 species, with 350 occurring at more than one site.'

questions:
  contributor: The referenced manuscript is a worldwide compilation, but
    this is ostensibly data from a single site that is part of the broader data set.
    Do you have a brief description of the sampling strategy used to collect the data
    and how the individual trait data were collected?
