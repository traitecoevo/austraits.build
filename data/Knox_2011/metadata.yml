  description: SLA and height data for 28 species from Knox (2011)
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: This research was conducted in the montane WSF and DSF of eastern
    Australia that are juxtaposed on metasedimentary and leucogranite lithologies
    that have soils of contrasting nutrient status (Table 1). The focal area for our
    study was a World Heritage area (Gibraltar Range–Washpool National Park) on the
    eastern slopes of a tableland at an altitude of 950 m with a mean annual rainfall
    of ca. 1800 mm that is not strongly seasonal. Fire is the main disturbance with
    crown fires at intervals of 10–50 years (Clarke et al. 2009). Environmental data
    for replicated plots among forest types were collected 5 years after fire and
    are summarized in Table 1. These plots are either in or adjacent to the locations
    of plots where resprouting data were collected. Both forest types are dominated
    by eucalypts that all have stem resprouts and are not top killed; they have a
    open canopy cover (\50% cover). The understorey of both forests consists of a
    dense species-rich shrub and small tree layer of varying height and fire response
    (Clarke et al. 2005, 2009). The WSF forms a midstratum (ca. 10 m height) after
    about 10 years of regrowth following crown fire. This mid-stratum in these forests
    closes after ca. 20 years following fire but remains open (\30% cover) for at
    least 5 years. Of those species that resprout after fire, nearly all are top killed
    in high-intensity fires, but they vary in sprouting vigour. During October 2002,
    a series of large landscapescale fires burnt most (ca. 12,000 ha) of the Gibraltar
    Range–Washpool National Park complex. Changing fire weather (low to extreme) produced
    a range of fire severities (degree of plant combustion) in both WSF and DSF (methods
    see Kumar et al. 2008). High and low fire severity sampling sites were selected
    from a fire severity map (Kumar et al. 2008), oblique aerial photographs and ground
    surveys. Sites were sampled from an area of ca. 3000 ha of high-severity burn
    and ca. 5000 ha of lower-severity burn (Kumar et al. 2008).

traits:
- var_in: Fire response
  unit_in: .na
  trait_name: fire_response
  value_type: expert_mean
  replicates: .na
  methods: At 5 years post-fire, the resprouting ability of 27 shrub and small tree
    species was measured across the two forest types and fire severities. Two sample
    areas (patches) were selected in each fire severity area based on ease of access;
    these areas were spaced at least 2 km from each other. Understorey species in
    the Fabaceae, Rutaceae, Myrtaceae, Lauraceae and Proteaceae were sampled in both
    the DSF and WSF (with the exception of Lauraceae where species could only be found
    in the WSF) (Table 2). Species were classified as post-fire resprouters or were
    non-sprouters (Table 2). For each species in the resprouter category, 40 individuals
    were measured in the low fire severity and 40 individuals measured in high fire
    severity areas stratified across two patches. To avoid size sampling bias, all
    individuals encountered within a patch were measured from a fixed starting point.
    The tallest resprouting stem height, diameter of the largest resprouting stem
    and number of resprouting basal stems were assessed on each individual. This information
    was then used to estimate post-fire vigour from the volume of the largest stem
    = ((diameter of tallest)/2)2 9 resprouting height). Resprouting species were then
    classified into strong or weak resprouters in response to fire severity. Species
    that had significantly lower volume and number of stems in the high-severity area
    were classified as weak resprouters and vice versa.
- var_in: SLA (cm2 g?1)
  unit_in: cm2/g
  trait_name: specific_leaf_area
  value_type: site_mean
  replicates: 5
  methods: Five fully expanded sun leaves without pathogen and herbivore damage were
    sampled from each plant by cutting the stems so that sun leaves could be obtained.
    The leaf area of each leaf was measured using a leaf area meter (Delta T Area
    Meter). The leaves were then dried in an oven at 80°C until they had a constant
    dry mass (48–96 h). SLA was calculated as the one-sided area of a fresh leaf divided
    by its dry mass.
- var_in: height (m)
  unit_in: m
  trait_name: plant_height
  value_type: expert_mean
  replicates: .na
  methods: Data on the maximum height or 'potential height' of the target species
    were collated from the literature and from field measurements.
- var_in: Bark thickness (mm)
  unit_in: mm
  trait_name: bark_thickness
  value_type: site_mean
  replicates: 5
  methods: A 10-cm length of stem was collected from all individuals at about one-third
    of the stem height. The bark (defined as all material external to the xylem) was
    removed. Bark area was then determined using a leaf area meter (Delta T Area Meter)
    and oven-dried for 48 h at 80°C. Bark mass per unit area was calculated as bark
    area/bark dry weight. Five random measurements of bark thickness were made on
    the dried bark material using calipers to provide a mean value for each individual.
- var_in: Stem density (g cm?3)
  unit_in: mg/mm3
  trait_name: wood_density
  value_type: site_mean
  replicates: 5
  methods: The stem volume, after bark removal, was determined by submerging fresh
    stem material in distilled water in a beaker on a tared balance. The change in
    mass was converted to a volume by the formula, displacement weight (mg)/0.998
    (mg mm-3), where 0.998 mg is the density of water at 20°C. Stems were then oven-dried
    for 48–96 h at 80°C to a constant weight and weighed to determine dry mass and
    then used to calculate stem oven dry specific gravity (oven dry mass/volume) which
    we refer to as 'wood density'. We found little difference in dry and fresh volumes
    of stems, hence the use of fresh stem volume.

  methods: A 10-cm length of stem was collected from all individuals at about one-third

    area/bark dry weight. Five random measurements of bark thickness were made on
    the dried bark material using calipers to provide a mean value for each individual.

  contributor: Do you have approximate Latitude and Longitude for the study
    sites? A single value for the entire study would be fine, as it would allow users
    to plot Washpool NP on a map.
