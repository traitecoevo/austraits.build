  description: A study assessing the extent to which fire persistence traits can be
    used to predict vegetation responses to fire regime changes in fire-prone arid
    and savanna landscape settings. Data is a compilation of traits for taxa in the
    Northern Territory Herbarium database, based on various published and unpublished
    sources.
  basis_of_record: literature
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: Our study region (11-26° S, 129-138° E) extends from the tropical
    north of Australia, with strongly seasonal, annually reliable summer monsoonal
    rainfall (MAR > 2000 mm), to the arid south, with slightly summer-dominant, decadally
    unreliable rainfall (MAR c. 200 mm). ^p Fire response attributes ^p Initially,
    1873 woody plant taxa in the Northern Territory Herbarium database (accessed November
    2009) were categorized for their response to burning ('fire response'), time to
    first seed, and seedbank longevity.

    description: Our study region (11-26°S, 129-138°E) extends from the tropical north
      of Australia, with strongly seasonal, annually reliable summer monsoonal rainfall
      (MAR > 2000 mm), to the arid south, with slightly summer-dominant, decadally
      unreliable rainfall (MAR c. 200 mm). This climatic gradient supports mostly
      annually to biennially burnt savanna vegetation in the north, to sparse, infrequently
      burnt vegetation in the south (Russell-Smith et al., 2007). The terrain is mostly
      flat to undulating, interspersed with remnant low hills and ranges, comprising
      mostly ancient, weathered and typically infertile land surfaces overlain in
      the south by extensive Late Tertiary aeolian dunefields. Despite the relative
      uniformity of climatic and landscape surfaces at broad regional scales, vegetation
      discontinuities may be locally abrupt, (1) associated with changes in edaphic
      conditions (e.g. savanna woodlands on freely draining sandy sediments giving
      way to tussock grasslands on clay plains), or (2) as modified by fire regimes
      (e.g. sharp boundaries in the absence of substrate discontinuities between monsoon
      rain forests and savanna in the north, and Acacia-dominated shrublands and Triodia-dominated
      hummock grasslands in semi-arid to arid settings in the south). Vegetation over
      the whole region has not been significantly modified by contemporary land use,
      which predominantly comprises extensive rangeland beef pastoralism.

  methods: ^p Fire response attributes ^p Initially, 1873 woody plant taxa in the
    Northern Territory Herbarium database (accessed November 2009) were categorized
    for their response to burning ('fire response'), time to first seed, and seedbank
    longevity. Long-lived seeders and resprouters are referred to here as those taxa
    that take at least 4 years until production of first seed. Initial time to first
    seeding categorization comprised of ≤ 1 year, 2-3 years, 4-5 years, 6-10 years,
    > 10 years. The database assembled for analysis comprised 1500 taxa attributed
    for all three traits (Appendix S1 in Supporting Information). Species traits were
    designated with reference to published literature and unpublished databases (New
    South Wales Fire Response Database, R.A. Bradstock, University of Wollongong,
    unpublished data; Northern Territory Ecological Response Database, J. Russell-Smith
    et al., unpublished data). Relevant published observations for sclerophyll taxa,
    while relatively scant, include Lacey & Whelan (1976), Setterfield (1997), Russell-Smith
    et al. (1998, 2010), Yates & Russell-Smith (2003), Russell-Smith & Setterfield
    (2006), Latz (2007), Wright & Clarke (2007, 2009). More comprehensive accounts
    are available for rain forest taxa (Bowman, 1991; Russell-Smith & Lee, 1992; Russell-Smith
    & Lucas, 1994; Russell-Smith, 1996; Russell-Smith et al., 1998; Russell-Smith
    & Setterfield, 2006). The assembled database of attributes was thoroughly assessed
    and revised (over 6 years) by expert plant ecologists, including three contributing
    authors (J.R.-S., C.B., K.B.). At the outset, we acknowledge that populations
    of various taxa may exhibit some degree of variability (both genetic and environmental)
    with respect to fire response, time to first seeding, and seedbank longevity traits
    (Vivian et al., 2010). While time to first seeding is often observed to vary under
    different environmental circumstances (e.g. more rapid maturation on mesic sites),
    our interest here is essentially between those taxa exhibiting typically short
    and longer (> 3 years) maturation periods.

    Northern Territory Herbarium database (accessed November 2009) were categorized
    for their response to burning ('fire response'), time to first seed, and seedbank
    longevity. Taxa included woody gymnosperms, monocotyledons (Arecaceae, and a small
    number of other woody rain forest taxa), and dicotyledons excluding arborescent
    mistletoes (Loranthaceae, Viscaceae - all seeders). Fire response categories comprised
    seeders, resprouters and facultative resprouters, where the latter refers to taxa
    that, following burning, behave as resprouters but also produce abundant germinants.
    Seeder taxa were defined as those where adults are typically killed after 100%
    scorch (sensuGill & Bradstock, 1992) by fires of at least moderate intensity (c.
    1000-2500 kW m-1, sensuRussell-Smith & Edwards, 2006). For all analyses, we omitted
    facultative resprouter taxa (seven species), taxa commonly observed to exhibit
    separate populations with seeder and resprouter traits (eight species), and exotic
    species. Nomenclature follows Short et al. (2011). The database assembled for
    analysis comprised 1500 taxa attributed for all three traits (Appendix S1 in Supporting
    Information). Species traits were designated with reference to published literature

    (both genetic and environmental) with respect to fire response, time to first
    seeding, and seedbank longevity traits (Vivian et al., 2010). For fire response,
    our observations and those of others (Vesk & Westoby, 2004; Clarke et al., 2005)
    indicate that application of a resprouter-seeder dichotomy is generally appropriate,
    at least for individuals experiencing fires of canopy-scorching or stem-killing
    severity.

    with respect to fire response, time to first seeding, and seedbank longevity traits
    (Vivian et al., 2010). Given the inherent small-scale patchiness of most savanna
    and arid-zone fires (e.g. Williams et al., 2003), we distinguish primarily between
    seeds that maintain viability for up to one growing season, and those that maintain
    viability for longer periods (e.g. dormant soil- and canopy-borne seedbanks).
    Our definition of seedbank persistence thus differs from that of Pausas et al.
    (2004) and Pausas & Bradstock (2007), who describe seedbank-persistent taxa as
    those whose seeds survive 100% scorch by fire.
