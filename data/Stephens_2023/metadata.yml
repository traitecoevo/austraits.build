  description: Study that models the evolution of pollination across angiosperms and
    quantify the timing and environmental associations of pollination shifts.
  basis_of_record: literature
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: "Scoring pollination mode ^p Pollination system or syndrome was
    scored for 1201 species across 434 plant families contained in the angiosperm
    phylogeny of Ramírez-Barahona et al. (2020). Where possible pollination was scored
    at species level (n = 1025), cross-checked against what is known of pollination
    in that genus and family, especially from the Kubitzki series (Kubitzki et al.,
    1993-2018). Where no information was available for a particular species they were
    scored at genus (n = 131), or family (n = 4) level. We obtained pollination data
    for 1160 of 1201 taxa, using the best available evidence to score the pollination
    system (n = 432) or syndrome (n = 728) for each taxon. Where possible, explicit
    studies of pollination ecology in a taxon's native range were preferred (n = 239),
    especially if these involved explicit tests for the occurrence of wind pollination
    (45 of these). Where these data were not available, we used records of floral
    visitation in combination with an interpretation of species floral syndrome (n
    = 193). ^p Where no field observations had been recorded, we interpreted species
    floral syndrome sensu Faegri & van der Pijl (1979) (n = 728). Although pollination
    syndromes can be inaccurate at fine taxonomic levels (Ollerton et al., 2009; van
    der Niet, 2021), they are effective predictors of the broad pollination groups
    used here (Rosas-Guerrero et al., 2014; Dellinger, 2020), especially wind pollination
    which has a well-defined suite of traits (Friedman & Barrett, 2008). Floral syndrome
    was interpreted from species descriptions, illustrations and images from various
    sources, including iNaturalist and eFloras (eFloras, 2022; iNaturalist, 2022),
    and informed by pollination syndrome data from trait databases including TRY (Kattge
    et al., 2020), BiolFlor (Kühn et al., 2004), and AusTraits (Falster et al., 2021).
    Full references are available in Supporting Information. ^p Floral syndrome was
    scored by considering all available evidence. To separate wind from animal pollinated
    flowers we assessed traits in Table 1 of Friedman & Barrett (2009) and pollen
    as described in Hu et al. (2008), particularly perianth size and colour, gynoecium
    size and shape, pollen and floral rewards (Table 1). To separate insect from vertebrate
    pollination syndromes we considered floral size and the robustness of floral parts,
    nectar quantity and the accessibility of floral rewards to different pollinators
    (e.g. the presence of poricidal anthers which only release pollen when vibrated
    by bees in buzz-pollinated flowers (Pritchard & Vallejo-Marín, 2020), Table 1).
    Water pollination was considered in the rare cases where plants had an aquatic
    habit and flowered near or under water (Ackerman, 2000). ^p Flowers were scored
    as polymorphic where there was evidence for more than one pollination mode, or
    where they were pollinated by animals but it was unclear whether this was vertebrate
    or insect pollination (n = 76). Where there was no evidence that pollination via
    external vectors occurred (in clonal or autogamous species) or no information
    was available these species were left as missing data (n = 41). Our final dataset
    included pollination information for 1160 of the 1201 species in 433 families
    (all except Hoplestigmataceae) in the Ramírez-Barahona et al. (2020) angiosperm
    tree. Fully referenced data are available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7592528."
  original_file: original file is the data.csv file - no reformatting required
  notes:  The data are structured such that taxa with multiple different pollination modes (e.g. birds and bees) have multiple lines per species (i.e. one for `bird`, one for `bee`) rather than `bird bee`.
