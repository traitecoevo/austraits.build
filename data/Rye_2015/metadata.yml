  methods: Measurements were recorded from dry specimens using the largest leaves
    available and taking care to measure other organs only when they appeared to be
    mature and sufficiently well pressed. For leaves, the words 'in outline' are used
    in the descriptions to indicate the shape of the blade from top (rather than from
    side) view.

questions:
  contributor: Are the plant height measurements, plant growth form classifications,
    and flowering time data from herbarium specimems or your own field observations?
