  description: A study exploring the impact of canopy position on leaf respiration
    (R) and associated traits in tree and shrub species growing in a lowland tropical
    rainforest in Far North Queensland, Australia.
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: 'Study site The study was carried out at the Daintree Rainforest
    Observatory (16 deg 07''S, 145 deg 27''E; 40 m above sea level) located in a lowland
    tropical wet forest ~140 km north of Cairns in Far North Queensland, Australia.
    A 48.5-m tall industrial crane (Liebherr 91 EC) established on the site provided
    access to the canopy of about one hectare of the rainforest. The annual precipitation
    is ~5440 mm; however, rainfall is highly seasonal with over 70% received between
    December and April. The mean annual temperature is 24.3 deg C. The soil is an
    acidic, dystrophic, brown dermosol (Isbell 1996) with many (20-50%) cobbles and
    stones throughout the profile. The soil is developed in colluvium from the metamorphic
    and granitic mountains to the west, and supports a complex mesophyll vine forest
    (Tracey 1982) with irregular canopy height (25-35 m) in which dominant canopy
    trees belong to the members of the Proteaceae, Meliaceae, Sapindaceae, Apocynaceae,
    Lauraceae and Myrtaceae families. The canopy closure of the site is reasonably
    typical of seasonal tropical rainforests with a leaf area index of 3.9 (Kalacska
    et al. 2005). Species selection Twelve evergreen dominant canopy tree species
    (Table 1) were selected from a variety of families in order to make comparisons
    of upper and lower canopy foliage. In addition, 10 understory species were selected
    to compare with the overstory trees where possible. The understory species were
    made up of four shadeadapted species [Atractocarpus hirtus (F.Muell.) Puttock,
    Bowenia spectabilis Hook. ex Hook.f., Cryptocarya laevigata Blume and Linospadix
    minor (W.Hill) Burret], four ''suppressed'' species that have the potential to
    become canopy dominants [Cordyline cannifolia R.Br., Darlingia darlingiana (F.Muell.)
    L.A.S.Johnson, Licuala ramsayi (F.Muell.) Domin and Syzygium monospermum Craven]
    and two other species, Tetracera nordtiana F.Muell.-a vine that is found near
    the ground as well having the potential to grow at the top of the canopy-thus,
    in our case the sampled plants might be considered suppressed, and Pseuduvaria
    froggattii (F.Muell.) Jessup-a small tree that can grow to 8 m, and as such will
    typically be found growing in the shade of taller trees-thus, it is difficult
    to conclude for this species if the individuals of this species at near ground
    level were ''suppressed''. None of the trees sampled were bearing fruits during
    the sampling period. However, several of the overstory species were at various
    stages of flowering (Dr W. Edwards, James Cook Univ., Cairns, personal communication):
    Acmena graveolens (F.M.Bailey) L.S.Sm-late flowering; Cardwellia sublimis F.Muell.-mid-flowering;
    Cryptocarya mackinnoniana F.Muell.-early flowering; Dysoxylum papuanum (Merr.
    & L.M.Perry) Mabb.-early flowering; Gillbeea adenopetala F.Muell.-early flowering;
    Myristica globosa Warb.-nothing; and Rockinghamia angustifolia (Benth.) Airy Shaw-mid-flowering.
    There were no flowers in Castanospermum australe A.Cunn & C.Fraser ex Hook, Elaeocarpus
    grandis F.Muell., Endiandra leptodendron B.Hyland, Xanthophyllum octandrum (F.Muell.)
    Domin or Ficus destruens F.Muell. ex C.T.White. No data are available on Gillbeea
    whypallana Rozefelds & Pellow or Ficus variegata Blume or for most of the understory
    species, with the exception of Licuala ramsayi (early flowering), P. froggattii
    (no flowers) and S. monospermum (no flowers). In those species where flowering
    is likely, it is possible that the carbohydrate profile of sampled leaves may
    have been affected by the increased demand for photosynthate in the reproductive
    tissue. Measurements were made on four replicate trees from each species, one
    replicate in each of the SE, NE, SW and NW quadrants of the area reached by the
    55-m-long crane jib. Measurements of the overstory trees were made at two positions
    in the canopy: north-facing sun-exposed leaves at the top of the canopy (hereafter
    referred to as ''upper canopy'' leaves) and south-facing leaves from deep in the
    canopy (hereafter referred to as ''lower canopy'' leaves). For the lower canopy
    leaves these were sampled from as low in the canopy as possible (3-5 m above the
    ground surface), where average irradiance on a horizontal surface in the late
    morning was 117 umol photons m-2 s-1 [measured using the external quantum sensor
    on an infra-red gas analysis (IRGA) system] (LICOR 6400XT, LI-COR, Inc., Lincoln,
    NE, USA). Equivalent average irradiance in the understory was 11 umol photons
    m-2 s-1, while at the top of the canopy the values were up to 2400 umol photons
    m-2 s-1.'

    11 am and 1 pm at 28 deg C using the crane facility. For both upper and lower
    canopy leaves, light-saturated photosynthesis (hereafter termed Asat) was first
    measured with the following settings: 1800 umol m-2 s-1 photosynthetic photon
    flux density (PPFD), relative humidity (RH) of 60-70%, 400 ppm CO2; photosynthesis
    was measured when CO2 concentrations in the sample IRGA had stabilized (typically
    within 10 min of exposure to 1800 umol m-2 s-1 PPFD). Thereafter, RD was measured
    after allowing at least 30 mins of darkness before measurements commenced. Measurements
    were made using fully expanded, newly mature leaves still attached to the plant
    at both positions in the canopy; although we do not have definitive data on the
    age of the sampled leaves, all are likely to be <1 year. Note, we cannot rule
    out photoinhibition of photosynthesis in lower canopy and understory leaves; however,
    in no case did we observe declines in rates of Asat during the stabilization period.

    with two IRGA systems incorporating CO2 control and 6 cm2 chambers, each with
    a red-blue light source (6400-02B). All measurements were made during the period
    of 2-24 September 2010. All in situ gas exchange measurements were made between
    11 am and 1 pm at 28 deg C using the crane facility. For both upper and lower
    canopy leaves, light-saturated photosynthesis (hereafter termed Asat) was first
    measured with the following settings: 1800 umol m-2 s-1 photosynthetic photon
    flux density (PPFD), relative humidity (RH) of 60-70%, 400 ppm CO2; photosynthesis
    was measured when CO2 concentrations in the sample IRGA had stabilized (typically
    within 10 min of exposure to 1800 umol m-2 s-1 PPFD). Thereafter, RD was measured
    after allowing at least 30 mins of darkness before measurements commenced. Measurements
    were made using fully expanded, newly mature leaves still attached to the plant
    at both positions in the canopy; although we do not have definitive data on the
    age of the sampled leaves, all are likely to be <1 year. Note, we cannot rule
    out photoinhibition of photosynthesis in lower canopy and understory leaves; however,
    in no case did we observe declines in rates of Asat during the stabilization period.
    Additional details recorded by the Licor 6400 are present in the data.csv file,
    including PAR, leaf temperature, CO2 concentration in the cuvette and relative
    humidity.'
