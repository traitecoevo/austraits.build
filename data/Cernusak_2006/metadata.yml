  description: Measurements of stem CO2 efflux and leaf gas exchange in a tropical
    savanna ecosystem in northern Australia, and assessed the impact of fire on these
    processes.
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: The stem CO2 efflux was initially measured at two locations,
    each of which was nested within a 3 km 2 plot. One plot was to be burned, while
    the other was to serve as an unburned control. At each location, the stem CO2
    efflux rates were measured on six individuals of each of the following tree species,
    E. miniata, E. tetrodonta, E. chlorostachys and C. bleeseri . The trees were selected
    to be broadly representative of the range of overstory stem diameters typically
    found in these savanna woodlands; diameters at 1.4 m height ranged from approximately
    10-60 cm on the measured trees. The stem CO 2 efflux measurements commenced on
    the control plot in June 2004. The treated plot was burned from 31 June to 1 July
    2004. The measurements commenced on the burned plot following the fire, but only
    using trees that suffered some degree of crown scorch. On 6 August 2004, the control
    plot was burned by an unplanned fire, despite preventative management. Therefore,
    a new location was selected for measuring the stem CO 2 efflux in unburned trees.
    In a testament to the fire-prone nature of the north-Australian savanna landscape,
    this new location also burned in an unplanned fire in October 2004. However, this
    fire was of a very low intensity and resulted in minimal scorching of the overstory
    canopy (< 5%); we therefore considered that these trees continued to be representatives
    of unburned trees following this fire event.

  methods: Stem CO2 efflux chambers were constructed from 1 L plastic food-storage
    containers (Klip It, Sistema Plastics, Auckland, New Zealand). The bottom of each
    container was cut away, allowing it to be sealed to the surface of a tree stem.
    A tubing was fitted to one chamber lid, providing an inlet and an outlet, and
    the seal on the lid was reinforced with closed-cell foam gasket material. The
    lid could then be sealed to the body of a container mounted on a tree stem by
    two locking clips. The bodies of the containers were sealed to tree stems with
    a silicon sealant, and remained in place between stem CO2 efflux measurements.
    We checked the chambers for leaks by exhaling near the seals and monitoring the
    CO2 concentration inside the chambers (Shibistova et al. 2002). The chamber volumes
    were determined following the method of Edwards & Hanson (1996); the mean chamber
    volume was 793 +/-  20 mL (mean +/- 1 SD). The mean total system volume including
    the infrared gas analyser (IRGA) was 958 +/- 21 mL (mean +/- 1 SD). Each chamber
    covered an area of 150 cm 2 of stem surface. Thermocouples were inserted to approximately
    1 cm depth in the stem sapwood of the sample trees. The chambers were placed near
    1.4-m stem height, and were located randomly with respect to aspect. The efflux
    of CO2 from each stem was measured with a closed-system, portable IRGA (LI-6200,
    Li-Cor, Lincoln, NE, USA). Soda lime was used to scrub the CO2 concentration inside
    the closed system to below the ambient concentration before each measurement.
    The concentration was then allowed to increase to about 15 u mol mol - 1 below
    the ambient concentration, at which time three successive measurements of the
    time taken for a 10 umol mol - 1 change in CO2 concentration were logged. All
    flow through the IRGA was directed first through a magnesium perchlorate desiccant
    trap to remove water vapour, thereby disposing of the need for a band-broadening
    correction (Hooper et al. 2002). The CO2 efflux rate was calculated as recommended
    by Hooper et al. (2002), using their eqn 13. The stem CO2 efflux was measured
    in the original set of control trees on 16-22 June and again on 15-20 July 2004.
    It was measured in the second set of control trees on 10- 21 September and 21-22
    October 2004, and on 18 January 2005. The burned trees were measured on 13-19
    July, 3-7 September and 19-20 October 2004, and on 17 January 2005. During each
    measurement period, the stem CO2 efflux was measured five to seven times on each
    tree from pre-dawn to late afternoon, in order to cover the full diurnal range
    of stem temperatures and CO2 efflux rates. An exception was in the January measurements,
    when each tree was measured only once near midday. In November 2004, a core was
    removed from each of the original control trees for the determination of sapwood
    depth, sapwood volume beneath the CO2 efflux chamber and sapwood density. Dendrometer
    bands (Agricultural Electronics Corp., Tucson, AZ, USA) were fitted to each of
    the trees measured for stem CO2 efflux in January; the stem growth was recorded
    over a 9 d period beginning the day after the CO2 efflux measurements. Of the
    48 dendrometer bands installed initially, 14 were found to have seized in the
    wetseason conditions; these trees were excluded from the analyses of stem growth.

  unit_in: umolCO2/m2/s
  trait_name: photosynthetic_rate_per_area_saturated
  value_type: individual_mean
  replicates: 4-12
  methods: Photosynthesis was measured on 12-15 October 2004 on what had been called
    previously the control plot, which burned approximately 9 weeks earlier on 6 August
    2004. This fire resulted in a nearly comprehensive scorch of the overstory canopy,
    and measurements were thus made on leaves that flushed subsequent to the fire
    event. Measurements were also made on unburned trees in an adjacent patch of open-forest
    savanna. Three trees each of E. miniata and E. tetrodonta were sampled at each
    location. On each tree, light-saturated photosynthesis (incident PFD > 1000 umol
    m-2 s-1) was measured on 6-10 mature, fully expanded leaves and on 6-10 expanding
    leaves. The expanding leaves had one-sided areas of approximately 10-30 cm2. The
    mature leaves had one-sided areas of approximately 50-70 cm2. Gas-exchange measurements
    were made with an LI-6400 portable photosynthesis system (Li-Cor). Canopy access
    was obtained with a 16 m elevated work platform, and measurements were made on
    overstory trees at heights ranging from 8 to 15 m. The flow rate through the LI-6400
    leaf chamber was 500 umol s-1. No attempt was made to control the vapour pressure
    within the cuvette, which therefore varied depending on the transpiration rate
    of the sample leaf. The leaves were sealed in the chamber for 3-5 min before gas-exchange
    data were logged. This was assumed long enough for the leaf temperature to acclimate
    to conditions within the cuvette, and short enough to avoid a significant alteration
    of stomatal conductance.

  trait_name: leaf_dark_respiration_per_area
  value_type: individual_mean
  replicates: 6-8
  methods: Dark respiration was measured on the leaves from one E. miniata and one
    E. tetrodonta tree at both the burned and unburned locations. The branches were
    excised, lowered to the ground and darkened for at least 30 min prior to measurement.
    Dark-respiration measurements were thus made during daylight hours. For each branch,
    six to eight mature and six to eight expanding leaves were measured.

  methods: The leaves were stripped from each branch and the fresh weight (FW) was
    determined. A subsample was then dried to constant weight at 75 deg C to determine
    the ratio of FW to dry weight (DW). The leaf DWs were converted to leaf areas
    using site-specific measurements of specific leaf area for E. miniata and E. tetrodonta
    (Chen 2002); the values were 6.0 and 5.3 m 2 kg-1, respectively. These values
    agree well with other published measurements of specific leaf area for these two
    species in the high rainfall zone of the Northern Territory (Schulze et al. 1998;
    Eamus et al. 1999a; Miller 2002; Prior, Eamus & Bowman 2003).

  methods: In order to gain insight into the distribution of sapwood in the branches
    of E. miniata and E. tetrodonta, we made measurements of the ratio of sapwood
    cross-sectional area to subtending leaf area (i.e. Huber value). The Huber value
    measurements were made in January 2005; the diameters of sampled branches ranged
    from 3.5 to 9.6 cm. The sapwood/heartwood boundary of each branch was identified
    visually based on a distinct colour change between the two. The leaves were stripped
    from each branch and the fresh weight (FW) was determined. A subsample was then
    dried to constant weight at 75 deg C to determine the ratio of FW to dry weight
    (DW). The leaf DWs were converted to leaf areas using site-specific measurements
