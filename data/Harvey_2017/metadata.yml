  description: An investigation of patterns of reproduction in south-western Australian
    kwongan and woodland after prescribed fires with a 30-year longitudinal study,
    with the aim of identifying appropriate fire intervals.
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: Experimental fires ^p Two areas of kwongan and mixed Allocasuarina
    huegeliana and Eucalyptus wandoo woodland vegetation were burnt at the end of
    the summer dry season, in April 1985 and March 1990. The 1985 fire in a 44-ha
    area of kwongan and woodland (previously burnt in 1960) was of moderate intensity,
    hot in patches, and resulted in near-complete burning of the target area. The
    1990 fire, in an area of 108 ha (previously burnt in 1965), was of moderate to
    high intensity. It burnt through most of the kwongan at a rate of 1100mh-1, through
    Allocasuarina woodlands in a continuous front with flame height reaching 2m and
    at a rate of 200mh-1. In Eucalyptus woodland, the fire slowed down to 100mh-1
    because of lower levels of ground cover and litter and reduced exposure to wind.
    The canopy of the Eucalyptus woodland and some of the Allocasuarina woodland remained
    unburnt; there were occasional unburnt mature Allocasuarina plants in areas where
    the fire had been of low intensity, but the shrub and herb layers were mostly
    or completely burnt. ^p Sampling strategy ^p To understand post-fire vegetation
    recovery and dynamics, 21 100-m2 circular plots (14 in woodland and seven in kwongan)
    were established in the spring of 1983, before the 1985 autumn fire, and resampled
    in the spring of 1985, 1986, 1987, 1988, 1990, 1992, 1995, 2000 and 2015. Similarly,
    45 100-m2 circular plots (29 in woodland and 16 in kwongan) established in the
    spring of 1988, before the 1990 autumn fire, were resampled in the spring of 1990,
    1991, 1992, 1994, 1997 and 2000. Within each plot, the fire-response (resprouter
    versus non-resprouter) of each species was determined together with the reproductive
    status of post-fire recruits for non-resprouters and post-fire resprouts for resprouters.
