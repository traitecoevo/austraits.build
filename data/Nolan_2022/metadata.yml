  description: A study to further our understanding of the role of physiological mechanisms
    and plant functional 19 traits in driving spatiotemporal variations in live fuel
    moisture content.
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: We produced pressure-volume curves and monitored temporal dynamics
    in LFMC and Psi-leaf in fou rspecies within the Cumberland Plain SuperSite of
    Australia's Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Network. A detailed site description
    can be found in Griebel et al. (2020). Briefly, the site is located in a mature
    woodland 50 km west of Sydney, Australia (Fig. 1a), on a flat floodplain of the
    Nepean-Hawkesbury River. The long-term mean annual rainfall is 800 mm (1881-2018
    period, BOM station 067105, <5km from the study site) and mid-afternoon temperature
    ranges between 17°C in winter and 29°C in summer. Eucalyptus moluccana and Eucalyptus
    fibrosa dominate the canopy, with an average height of 25 m, while Melaleuca decora
    trees of approximately 5-12 m height grow in the subcanopy as well as an overstory
    tree in melaleuca-dominated areas (Griebel et al., 2020). The sclerophyllous understorey
    layer is dominated by up to 3 m tall Bursaria spinosa shrubs which cooccur with
    the eucalypt and melaleuca trees. ^p In addition, we measured maximum LFMC in
    the dominant over-storey species at seven additional locations along a climatic
    gradient (Fig. 1). There was a total of 16 species, with all but one belonging
    to the Eucalyptus genus, or the related genus Angophora. The one additional species
    not belonging to these genera was a gymnosperm Callitris glaucophylla (Table 2).
    For this species, leaves are scale like on terminal terete branches. We sampled
    these terminal branches. Vegetation types sampled included floodplain and subalpine
    woodlands, as well as dry and wet sclerophyll forests (Table 2).

  methods: For each of the 16 species measured along a climatic gradient (Fig. 1,
    Table 2), we collected 3 leaves from each of 5 trees. Samples were hydrated for
    3 hours (following Arndt et al., 2015), before leaf fresh mass, leaf area and
    leaf thickness were measured following standard procedures (PerezHarguindeguy
    et al., 2013). Leaves were then oven-dried at 105°C for 48 hours before dry mass
    was measured. We calculated the following leaf-level traits, (i) maximum LFMC,
    (ii) leaf mass per area (LMA), (iii) specific leaf area (SLA), (iv) leaf density,
    and (v) leaf dry matter content (LDMC), see Table 1 for trait formulations.

  methods: Pressure-volume curves were performed following standard methods 164 (Sack
    et al., 2011; Turner, 1981; Tyree and Hammel, 1972) on two shoots from each of
    five replicate plants for each of the four study species at the Cumberland Plain
    SuperSite. For the two eucalypt species we sampled leaves only, whereas for M.
    decora and B. spinosa we sampled stems and leaves since the leaves of these species
    are very small (<0.5 cm length, compared with >8 cm length for the eucalypts).
    Measurements were undertaken in December 2018. Shoots were collected at pre-dawn
    and rehydrated until Psi-leaf was > -0.1 MPa (~2 hours). Following rehydration,
    shoots were dehydrated on a bench and Psi-leaf and leaf mass were measured periodically.
    We used a Scholander-type pressure chamber for Psi-leaf measurements. Then we
    generated standard pressure-volume curves plots of -1/Psi-leaf as a function of
    relative water content (Sack et al., 2011).
