  description: We ask whether correlations among above-ground and below-ground plant
    traits conform with predictions from resource-economic spectrum theory; and if
    root functional traits vary along a small-scale hydrologic gradient in the same
    manner as above-ground functional traits
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: The site is within the study area of Letten et al.(2015) on a
    local soil moisture gradient, which marks a transition between two vegetation
    classes known as Sydney Coastal Heaths on drier soils and Coastal Heath Swamps
    on wetter soils (Keith 2004). We established eighteen 10- by 10-m plots across
    the hydrological gradient within our target vegetation community.The four above-ground
    traits measured were leaf size (mm2), specific leaf area (SLA; m2 kg-1), plant
    height (m) and leaf dry-matter content (LDMC; mg g-1) following (Pérez-Harguindeguy
    et al. 2013). These traits were chosen based on connection to key functions (Díaz
    et al. 2016; Garnier et al. 2016). For each species, these traits were measured
    on three individuals randomly selected from each of the quadrats, sampling at
    least three leaves on each individual for leaf traits. The four fine root traits
    measured were root branching intensity (RBI; tips cm-1), specific root length
    (SRL; m g-1), root tissue density (RTD; mg mm-3) and root dry-matter content (RDMC;
    mg g-1). These traits were chosen to enable comparison of results to those of
    Kramer-Walter et al (2016) which explored variation in fine root traits across
    soil fertility gradients. At each of our quadrats, we measured these four fine
    root traits on up to three randomly selected individuals of each target species
    present in the plot, amounting to a total of 490 root samples.

  methods: Measured on the first and second order roots less than 0.2mm in width. RDMC was calculated as dry mass/ root volume (mg g-1). Root volume was determined using a pycnometer, with the difference between the pycnometer with and without 
    roots plus the mass of the fine roots divided by the density of the water equalling the volume of the roots. Dry root sample placed in a paper envelope and dried over 48hrs at 60c in a drying oven. Mass measured on a balance to 3 dp (mg)
