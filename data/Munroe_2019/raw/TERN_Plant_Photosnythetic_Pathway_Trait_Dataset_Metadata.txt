Methods for Photosynthetic Pathway Assignment 

#############################################

The TERN Plant Photosynthetic Pathway Trait Databset includes species detected at TERN Ecosystem Surveillance plots
using the TERN Ausplots Rangelands method. AusPlots Rangelands protocols are detailed in the TERN Ausplots Rangelands manual. 
The most relevant protocols are detailed here. TERN plots (1 ha, 100 x 100 m) are permanently established sites located in a 
homogenous area of terrestrial vegetation. There are currently over 700 plots in Australia. 
Ground observers recorded the presence of all species within each plot. Tissue samples of each plant species were collected 
for carbon stable isotope analysis. Voucher specimens are sent to specialised herbaria 
across Australia for identification to the lowest possible taxonomic level. 
For more information on TERN and our survey methodology, visit www.tern.org.

Species recorded at each plot were assigned a photosynthetic pathway using a combination of 
- information from existing plant trait databases
- published literature
- carbon stable isotope analysis performed by TERN using TERN tissue samples

Species with a carbon stable isotope value of <-19 were designated C3
Species with a carbon stable isotope value of =>-19 were designated C4

If species-specific information was not available from the literature and no tissue sample was available, 
species were assigned a photosynthetic pathway if they belonged to well-established C3 or C4 lineages (e.g. Acacia sp, Eucalyptus sp)

Dataset Values

#############################################

#Genus_Species: Species identification as determined by herbaria. Names have been validated using the Australian Plant Name Index (APNI)
Note that species names may have changed since the original identification.

#Family: Family for each species. Families have been validated using the APNI
However, family designations may have changed since the original identification.

#The photosynthetic pathway assignments are distributed across three columns;

- Photosynthetic.pathway (confirmed using data from literature or TERN stable isotope analysis): the species-specific photosynthetic pathway has been 
  confirmed using TERN isotope analysis or was identified in the literature 

- Photosyntehtic.pathway (inferred from lineage): the species-specific photosynthetic pathway was inferred based on their lineage (usually genus). 
  While we are confident in these assignments, it should be should noted that some genera are known to contain both C3 and C4 species 
  and we encourage users to review our assessments prior to incorporating them into their own analysis.

- Photosynthetic.pathway (combined): This is the combination of the two other Photosynthetic.pathway columns.
 
The possible pathways are C3, C4, CAM, C3-C4, C3-CAM, C4-CAM, or U (unknown). 

#Source: References or sources used for photosynthetic pathway assignments. 
- "TERN SIA" indicates TERN plant samples were used for carbon isotope analysis to determine the photosynthetic pathway.
-  "TRY" indicates the photosynthetic pathway was assigned based on information available from the TRY Plant Trait Database
-  All other references are from the literature (available as a seperate spreadsheet)

#Justification for assessment based on lineage: If the photosynthetic pathway was inferred based on lineage, we have provided a short 
 justification, in conjunction with our sources, to support our photosynthetic pathway assignment.
 
#Notes: any additional notes on this species that are relevant to the photosynthetic pathway assignment,
       for example, conflicting findings in the literature.
