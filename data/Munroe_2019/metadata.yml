  description: TERN Plant Photosynthetic Pathway Trait Dataset
  collection_type: literature
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: The TERN Plant Photosynthetic Pathway Trait Databset includes
    species detected at TERN Ecosystem Surveillance plots using the TERN Ausplots
    Rangelands method. AusPlots Rangelands protocols are detailed in the TERN Ausplots
    Rangelands manual. The most relevant protocols are detailed here. TERN plots (1
    ha, 100 x 100 m) are permanently established sites located in a homogenous area
    of terrestrial vegetation. There are currently over 700 plots in Australia. Ground
    observers recorded the presence of all species within each plot. Tissue samples
    of each plant species were collected for carbon stable isotope analysis. Voucher
    specimens are sent to specialised herbaria across Australia for identification
    to the lowest possible taxonomic level. For more information on TERN and our survey
    methodology, visit www.tern.org.

  methods: Species recorded at each plot were assigned a photosynthetic pathway using
    a combination of information from existing plant trait databases, published literature,
    and carbon stable isotope analysis performed by TERN using TERN tissue samples.
    Species with a carbon stable isotope value of <-19 were designated C3. Species
    with a carbon stable isotope value of =>-19 were designated C4. If species-specific
    information was not available from the literature and no tissue sample was available,
    species were assigned a photosynthetic pathway if they belonged to well-established
    C3 or C4 lineages (e.g. Acacia sp, Eucalyptus sp). There are additional columns
    in the data.csv file providing information about the data source. References or
    sources used for photosynthetic pathway assignments. 'TERN SIA' indicates TERN
    plant samples were used for carbon isotope analysis to determine the photosynthetic
    pathway. 'TRY' indicates the photosynthetic pathway was assigned based on information
    available from the TRY Plant Trait Databas. All other references are from the
    literature (available as a seperate spreadsheet in the raw data folder).
