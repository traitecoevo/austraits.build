Control of the late emergents before seed formation will prevent fresh seeds being added to the existing seed bank.

Mature plants are drought resistant. Dense infestations provide cover for rabbits and create a fire hazard. Additional information. Origin. South Africa, Yemen. History of use/introduction. Most likely first introduced to Australia in hay. Garden escape. Suggested method of management and control. Dig out small infestations. Slash in winter and/or spray with 1% glyphosate + penetrant in spring to autumn. Follow up treatment until regrowth ceases. Follow-up seedling control. Use unplanned fire events to effectively control any regrowth. Read the manufacturers' labels and material safety data sheets before using herbicides.
