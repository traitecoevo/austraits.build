  description: This pilot study investigated the feasibility of using TERN (Australia's
    national land ecosystem observatory) data to measure a single morphological trait,
    specific leaf area. The study was restricted to Eucalyptus spp. and aimed to inform
    future sampling strategy for SLA.
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: The first component of the study was the measurement of leaves
    from voucher specimens. We located 30 Eucalyptus vouchers exclusively from South
    Australian plots (figure 1) and took 5 leaves from each specimen to be dried and
    measured for leaf area and mass. The second component was the collection and measurement
    of fresh leaf samples. We collected 5 leaves from 5 individuals for 3 species
    growing at Waite Conservation Reserve in Adelaide, South Australia. The leaves
    were mounted, scanned and measured as before. They were then dried and weighed
    with the same microbalance to measure leaf area shrinkage between fresh and dry
    leaves and leaf SLA for dry and fresh leaves.

  methods: This is the one-sided area of the dry leaf. The leaves were mounted onto
    sheets of paper, placed into a plant press and dried in an oven for 24 hours at
    70C, and scanned with a flatbed scanner. Leaf area was measured from the scans
    using ImageJ software.

  methods: This is the mass of the dry leaf. The mounted leaves were placed into a
    plant press and dried in an oven for 24 hours at 70C. Each leaf was individually
    weighed using a 0.1mg microbalance. The leaves collected from Waite Conservation
    Reserve in Adelaide, South Australia were dried in an oven for 72 hours at 70C
    and weighed with the same microbalance.

  method_context: dry leaf measurement
  methods: SLA here is measured with the dry area and dry mass of the leaf. The leaves
    were mounted onto sheets of paper and scanned with a flatbed scanner. Leaf area
    was measured from the scans using ImageJ software. The mounted leaves were placed
    into a plant press and dried in an oven for 24 hours at 70C. Each leaf was individually
    weighed using a 0.1mg microbalance. For the leaves from Waite Conservation Reserve
    in Adelaide, South Australia, the leaves were dried in an oven for 72 hours at
    70C and weighed with the same microbalance. The dried leaves were scanned and
    measured for leaf area as before. SLA was obtained for each leaf using the formula...
    dry area / dry mass.

  trait_name: leaf_area
  entity_type: individual

  methods: This is fresh leaf area. The leaves were mounted onto sheets of paper,
    scanned with a flatbed scanner and measured using ImageJ software.

  method_context: fresh leaf measurement
  methods: SLA here is calculated with fresh leaf area and dry leaf mass. The leaves
    were mounted onto sheets of paper, scanned with a flatbed scanner and measured
    using ImageJ software. They were then dried in an oven for 72 hours at 70C and
    weighed with a 0.1mg microbalance. Fresh SLA was obtained for each leaf using
    the formula... fresh area / dry mass.

  methods: The leaves were mounted onto sheets of paper, scanned with a flatbed scanner
    and measured for leaf area using ImageJ software. They were then dried in an oven
    for 72 hours at 70C. The dried leaves were scanned and measured again so that
    leaf area shrinkage between fresh and dry leaves could be estimated. Shrinkage
    percentage was obtained using the formula... ((fresh area - dry area) / fresh
    area) * 100.
