  description: A study in extremely phosphorus (P)-impoverished soils in south-western
    Australia to explore how leaf P concentrations and foliar P allocation of Proteaceae
    and coexisting dominant plant families vary between seasons and habitats.
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: 2.1. Study site and species selection ^p Field work for this
    study was conducted at two sites in Alison Baird Reserve (32°1'19''S 15°58'52''E).
    The climate in the study area is Mediterranean, with warm dry summers (December
    to February) and cool wet winters (June to August) (Gentilli, 1972). Rainfall
    mostly occurs from late May to early September. The mean annual rainfall (1989-2020)
    is 804.3 mm according to Gosnells City weather station (32°3'S, 115.58'48″E) (Australian
    Government Bureau of Meteorology, 2022). The site on top of a Bassendean sand
    dune (BD) has soil that is moist in winter, but never waterlogged due to its elevation
    and well-drained sandy composition, and dry in summer, while the West flat (WF)
    site has a five-meters lower elevation where water accumulates and waterlogs plant
    in winter, but is dry in summer (Gao et al., 2020) (Fig. 1) Waterlogging at WF
    usually occurs intermittently from July to early September when rainfall is more
    abundant during the rainy season. The soils at both sites are characteristic of
    old climatically-buffered infertile landscapes (OCBILs) (Hopper, 2009; Hopper
    et al., 2016) which belong to the most P-impoverished soils globally (Leopold
    and Zhong, 2019). The mean annual maximum temperature is 25.6 °C, while the mean
    monthly highest and lowest temperature are 33 °C (January) and 18.7 °C (July),
    respectively (Australian Government Bureau of Meteorology, 2022). ^p The target
    species were Proteaceae, Fabaceae and Myrtaceae, which are three dominant native
    plant families in south-western Australia, including the reserve. Three species
    from each family were selected from each site (Table S1). In general, plants on
    the Bassendean dune have deeper roots than plants in the flat area, as shown by
    analysis of stable isotopes of soil water and xylem sap (Gao et al., 2020). All
    targeted species are evergreen; Proteaceae produce new leaves in spring, while
    Fabaceae and Myrtaceae produce new leaves all year round, providing water is adequate
    for leaf growth. ^p 2.2. Plant and soil collection ^p Fieldwork was conducted
    at the end of winter (September 2019) before soil inundation ceased, and at the
    end of summer (early April 2019 and March 2020), before there were substantial
    autumn/winter rain events. Leaf sample collection was conducted between 9 am and
    11.30 am on sunny days in both seasons. Mature most-recently fully-expanded leaves
    with no visible damage were sampled from five individuals of each species (Fig.
    1). Targeted plants did not have significant shading within their canopies, and
    leaves were collected from around the sun-exposed canopy of the plants. Samples
    were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen at harvest. At each WF and BD site, six replicates
    of soil samples evenly distributed around the study site were collected (Fig.
    1). Each replicate comprised three pooled subsamples (20 cm deep) that were taken
    about one meter apart.

    Scanner, Epson, Los Alamitos, USA) to determine their leaf area (WinRHIZO, Regent
    Instruments, Québec City, Canada), then dried at 70-80 °C for 72 h until constant
    weight. Leaf mass per area was calculated by dividing oven-dried leaf mass by
    leaf area.

    °C, then with 1 mL of 32 % HCl at 130 °C. Deionised water was added to adjust
    the final volume to 10 mL before determining P.

    25 mg freeze-dried leaf samples by homogenising in ice-cold 1 % (v/v) acetic acid
    (Precellys 24 Homogeniser, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA) and special
    care was taken to keep the samples and solutions cold. The homogenate was clarified
    twice by centrifugation at 21,000 xg for 15 min at 4 °C (Yan et al., 2019). The
    extracts were treated with acid-washed activated charcoal to remove interfering
    substances (Dayrell et al., 2022). The P concentration in the final extracts was
    determined colorimetrically using a malachite green-based method (Motomizu et
    al., 1983).Aliquots of 50 mg of freeze-dried ground leaf samples were used to
    determine P allocation to nucleic acids, phospholipids, small P-containing metabolites
    and residual P using the method of Yan et al. (2019), adapted from Hidaka and
    Kitayama (2013). Fractions were separated based on differential solubility in
    various solvents. Metabolic P, which contains Metabolite P and Pi, was highly
    water-soluble material. Lipid P was chloroform-soluble material. Nucleic acid
    P was insoluble in 5 % trichloroacetic acid but soluble in 2.5 % trichloroacetic
    acid at 95 °C. Residual P was material that was not soluble in either 5 % or 2.5
    % trichloroacetic acid.

    P was insoluble in 5 % trichloroacetic acid but soluble in 2.5 % trichloroacetic
    acid at 95 °C. Residual P was material that was not soluble in either 5 % or 2.5
    % trichloroacetic acid.

  methods: Leaf sample collection was conducted between 9 am and 11.30 am on sunny
    days in both seasons. Mature most-recently fully-expanded leaves with no visible
    damage were sampled from five individuals of each species (Fig. 1). Targeted plants
    did not have significant shading within their canopies, and leaves were collected
    from around the sun-exposed canopy of the plants. Samples were snap-frozen in
    liquid nitrogen at harvest. At each WF and BD site, six replicates of soil samples
    evenly distributed around the study site were collected (Fig. 1). Each replicate
    comprised three pooled subsamples (20 cm deep) that were taken about one meter
    apart. Leaf samples were freeze-dried for seven days (VirTis Bench Top freeze
    dryer, SP Scientific, New York, USA) then ground to a fine powder (Geno Grinder,
    Spex SamplePrep, Metuchen, NJ, USA). Inorganic phosphate (Pi) was extracted from
    25 mg freeze-dried leaf samples by homogenising in ice-cold 1 % (v/v) acetic acid
    (Precellys 24 Homogeniser, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA) and special
    care was taken to keep the samples and solutions cold. The homogenate was clarified
    twice by centrifugation at 21,000 xg for 15 min at 4 °C (Yan et al., 2019). The
    extracts were treated with acid-washed activated charcoal to remove interfering
    substances (Dayrell et al., 2022). The P concentration in the final extracts was
    determined colorimetrically using a malachite green-based method (Motomizu et
    al., 1983).Aliquots of 50 mg of freeze-dried ground leaf samples were used to
    determine P allocation to nucleic acids, phospholipids, small P-containing metabolites
    and residual P using the method of Yan et al. (2019), adapted from Hidaka and
    Kitayama (2013). Fractions were separated based on differential solubility in
    various solvents. Metabolic P, which contains Metabolite P and Pi, was highly
    water-soluble material. Lipid P was chloroform-soluble material. Nucleic acid
    P was insoluble in 5 % trichloroacetic acid but soluble in 2.5 % trichloroacetic
    acid at 95 °C. Residual P was material that was not soluble in either 5 % or 2.5
    % trichloroacetic acid.

  trait_name: water_potential_predawn
  entity_type: individual
  value_type: raw
  basis_of_value: measurement
  replicates: 1
  methods: The pre-dawn leaf water potential of individual plants was measured using
    a PMS Model 1000 Pressure Chamber (PMS Instrument Company, Corvallis, OR, USA).
    Leaves or leafy twigs were cut, immediately placed in plastic zip bags and transferred
    to the pressure chamber for measurement. All measurements were done on cloudless
    mornings before sunrise both at the end of winter (September 2019) and at the
    end of summer (early April 2019 and March 2020).
