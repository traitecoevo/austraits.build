  description: Using LMA, leaf Delta13C, and leaf N measurements on complete species
    assemblages sampled at sites on a north-south transect from tropical to temperate
    Australia, we tested the prediction that Rubisco capacity should be directly proportional
    to irradiance but should decrease with increases in ci:ca and temperature.
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: Our analyses are based on 442 leaf measurements representing
    all species found in a 100m x 100m plot at each of 27 sites on a broad north-south
    transect across Australia. We performed a regression analysis to test the relationships
    of Narea with mean annual temperature (MAT), irradiance, plant trait leaf mass
    per area (LMA), ci:ca ratio, and N-fixation capacity. We also fitted a statistical
    model in which Narea was treated as the sum of a metabolic component proportional
    to predicted (optimal) photosynthetic capacity at standard temperature (based
    on temperature, irradiance, and ci:ca ratio) and a structural component proportional
    to LMA. Finally, we carried out a trait gradient analysis in order to quantify
    the contributions of environment vs. species identity to variation in Narea, ci:ca
    ratio, and LMA.
