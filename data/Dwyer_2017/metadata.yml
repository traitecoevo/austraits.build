  description: Trade-offs maintain diversity and structure communities along environmental
    gradients. Theory indicates that if covariance among functional traits sets a
    limit on the number of viable trait combinations in a given environment, then
    communities with strong multidimensional trait constraints should exhibit low
    species diversity. We tested this prediction in winter annual plant assemblages
    along an aridity gradient using multilevel structural equation modelling. Univariate
    and multivariate functional diversity measures were poorly explained by aridity,
    and were surprisingly poor predictors of community richness. By contrast, the
    covariance between maximum height and seed mass strengthened along the aridity
    gradient, and was strongly associated with richness declines. Community richness
    had a positive effect on local neighbourhood richness, indicating that climate
    effects on trait covariance indirectly influence diversity at local scales. We
    present clear empirical evidence that declines in species richness along gradients
    of environmental stress can be due to increasing constraints on multidimensional
    phenotypes.
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: We selected 12 bushland remnants that spanned > 3 deg latitude
    across the wheatbelt. Average daily temperatures during the winter-spring growing
    season (June-October) vary from 16 deg C in the south to 19 deg C in the north.
    Mean annual precipitation varies from 295 mm in the east to 400 mm in the west.
    Remnants varied from 60 ha patches dominated by York gum-jam woodlands, to much
    larger reserves (> 3000 ha) that included discrete patches of York gum-jam woodlands
    within a mosaic of other ecosystem types that generally do not support diverse
    winter annual communities. In each remnant, three 15 x 15 m2 sites were established
    in native-dominated herbaceous vegetation within York gum-jam woodland habitat
    (Fig. 3). Sites were at least 80 m apart and were systematically placed to capture
    different levels of average woody canopy cover. In addition, all sites were more
    than 100 m from woodland edges with no obvious signs of anthropogenic disturbance
    or nutrient enrichment from adjacent agricultural land uses. Under the naturally
    low soil nutrient conditions examined in this study, local-scale richness continues
    to increase with total herbaceous plant cover (Fig. S2). Thus, herbaceous production
    is rarely high enough, even in the wettest communities, for richness to decline
    due to light competition (e.g. Hautier et al. 2009). Within each site, herbaceous
    assemblages were sampled in 15 randomly located quadrats (0.3 x 0.3 m2). The identity
    and abundance (counts of individuals) of all species were recorded and the tallest
    individual of each species was collected and pressed in the field. In each quadrat
    we also collected data on woody (tree and shrub) canopy cover, soil hardness,
    coarse woody debris (CWD), sclerophyll litter cover,soil pH and soil nutrients
    (plant-available N, P and K).
  original_file: species.in.quadrat.scale.data.csv and quadrat.scale.data.csv
  notes: For the trait values, within each species duplicate values are eliminated
    as these were always instances when the same trait value (usually for seed mass)
    was given for species at different sites (remnants). The code used to search for
    duplicates keeps the value at the first remnant in the data.csv file; therefore
    for seed mass, which site coordinates are associated with the species' seed mass
    value are arbitrary.

  methods: At the end of the growing season we revisited a number of remnants to collect
    bulk seed from as many species as possible. Due to the size of the study region
    and variation in reproductive phenology within and between species, it was not
    possible to collect seed from all species in all remnants. Nonetheless, seed was
    collected from at least one remnant for the vast majority of species, representing
    93% of species occurrences in the overall dataset. For some species that were
    not seeding at the time of collection we sourced published mean estimates (Arditti
    & Ghani 2000; Moles et al. 2004 and the studies cited therein) or applied genus-level
    means, resulting in overall coverage of 96% of species occurrences. Seed mass
    was measured as the average of 100 seeds from bulk collections, excluding seeds
    with obvious damage or deformities. Dispersules were removed, seeds were oven
    dried at 60 deg C for 72 hours and weighed using a microbalance (Sartorius AG,
    Goettingen, Germany).

  methods: SLA was measured in the laboratory on field-pressed specimens collected
    in each quadrat during the survey. Leaves were rehydrated following Perez-Harguindeguy
    et al. (2013) prior to digital area measurement. Each leaf was then oven dried
    at 60 deg C for 72 hours and weighed using a microbalance (Sartorius AG, Goettingen,
    Germany). For a few species there is only a single unique value for the species,
    but most species have unique values for each remnant (site). (Note from author,
    it makes sense that these values are among the highest in AusTraits, because they
    are all herbaceous (mostly annual) species and the methodology used may slightly
    increase SLA values.)
