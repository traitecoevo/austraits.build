  description: A lab study to determine how traits of 12 species of Western Australian
    Proteaceae affect the likelihood of seedling herbivory in the field.
  basis_of_record: lab
  life_stage: seedling
  sampling_strategy: Collection of plant material ^p Seeds were collected from two
    locations in Western Australia in April 1999. Fruits (cones or follicles) of Banksia
    prionotes (nomenclature follows McCarthy (1999), Banksia leptophylla, Hakea trifurcata,
    Hakea psilorrhyncha, Dryandra sessilis ssp. cygnorum and Dryandra carlinoides
    were collected from sites near Eneabba (29"32'S, 115"19'), 300 km north of Perth.
    Fruits of Banksia boxten, Banksia coccinia, Hakea lasiantha, Hakea cuculiata,
    Dryandra sessilis ssp. sessilis and Dryandra mucronulata were collected from sites
    near the Waychinicup National Park, 50 km east of Albany (34"38'S, 118"45'E).
    In order to extract the seeds, follicles were burned for approximately 30 s until
    they split open. Fruits were then immersed in water before being placed in direct
    sunlight and dried until the seeds fell out. ^p Serotiny and establishment success
    ^p In order to quantify differences in the ability of our matched congeners to
    germinate and establish in the absence of fire, we attempted to age the populations
    from which seeds were collected. These populations were aged in vegetation unburned
    for at least 15 years. All individuals along a 5-m-wide transect were aged until
    100 plants were encountered. Plant age was estimated by counting the number of
    branch junctions from the highest point of the plant to its base, one junction
    representing a single year (Lamont 1985). Seedling characteristics and herbivore
    attack. Those seedling characteristics thought to significantly influence the
    likelihood of herbivore attack under field conditions (Hanley 1998) were quantified
    in 28-day-old seedlings of each of the 12 experimental species. These characteristics
    included aspects of chemical defence (cotyledon phenolic and cyanide content),
    cotyledon nutrient content (percentage nitrogen), sclerophylly (cotyledon thickness
    and SLA), and seedling size (cotyledon area). ^p Chemical defence ^p Three hundred
    seeds of each of the 12 experimental species were germinated in Petri dishes in
    a dark incubator set at 15C. Immediately following germination (10-14 days), seedlings
    were transferred to 7x7-cm square pots containing a 4:1 sand:peat compost mixture.
    Nine seedlings of the same species were planted into each pot in a 3x3 array,
    such that each seedling was 2 cm from its nearest neighbours. There were ten pot
    replicates for each species. When the seedlings were exactly 28 days old, all
    shoots within each pot were harvested and dried in an oven for 48 h at 50C. The
    relatively low drying temperature reduces the risk of denaturing carbon-based
    secondary metabolites (Hagerman 1988). Following drying, the plant material was
    ground using a pestle and mortar. Each pot of nine seedlings represented a single
    replicate (individual seedlings being too small to accurately test for phenolics).
    Total phenols were extracted from 50 mg ground leaf material added to 7.5 ml distilled
    water boiled for 2 h. The extract was centrifuged at 3,000 r.p.m. for 15 min and
    a 1-ml sample removed and added to 7.5 ml distilled water. To this, 1 ml Folin-Denis
    reagent and 0.5 ml sodium carbonate were added and samples left to stand for 15
    min before a final centrifuge treatment at 3,000 r.p.m. for 15 min. The absorbance
    of each sample was read at 760 nm and plotted against a standard curve produced
    from a similar analysis of tannic acid.

  methods: Cyanogenic glycosides have also been recorded in the Proteaceae (Lamont
    1993). In order to determine whether cyanide was important in our experimental
    species, we conducted a simple qualitative test (Lamont 1993). One 28-day-old
    seedling (about 0.1 g freshly harvested plant material) was placed in a 10-ml
    screw-top vial and crushed with a metal rod. Three drops of deionised water and
    three drops of 0.1% glucosidase (Emulsin, Sigma) were then added. Feigl-Anger
    test paper was cut into strips 60 mm long and 5 mm wide and suspended just above
    the mixture in each vial via the cap. Samples were left for 2 h at room temperature,
    the presence of cyanide indicated by the test paper turning blue. Cyanide tests
    were replicated 10 times for each species.

  methods: Changed units, because values 10x higher than any others in AusTraits. If units indicating in manuscript are correct, then values aren't comparable; Percentage leaf nitrogen was determined on a three-channel autoanalyser
    system, using a modified Kjeldahl digestion method (Anonymous 1977). Samples were
    taken from the same plants used in the phenolic test and were prepared in a similar
    way. About 0.1 g dried and milled shoot material was digested in a 6 ml mixture
    of sulphuric acid and 6% salicylic acid overnight (Ekpete and Cornfield 1964).
    This mixture was boiled at 350C for 20 min, allowed to cool and 2 ml hydrogen
    peroxide added. The process was repeated 3 times until the samples became clear,
    after which a final heat treatment at 350C for 30 min was applied (Yuen and Pollard
    1954). Nitrogen was colorimetrically determined by indophenol blue (Searle 1984)

    placed mid-way across the long axis of a single cotyledon. Cotyledon area was
    determined by measuring the area of a single cotyledon using an image analyser
    (Delta-T Devices, Cambridge). The same cotyledons were oven dried at 80?C overnight
    and dry weight biomass determined. SLA was calculated by dividing cotyledon area
    by dry weight. The process was repeated for ten individuals of each species.
