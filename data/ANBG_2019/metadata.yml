  sampling_strategy: The Australian National Botanic Gardens' National Seed Bank is
    building a collection of native seed for conservation and research. The seed bank
    is home to a large and ever-increasing collection of Australian native seeds,
    and in particular holds significant collections from the Australian alpine bioregion,
    endangered grassland and grassy-woodland communities of South-Eastern Australia,
    and Parks Australia's Commonwealth terrestrial reserves. The National Seed Bank
    is an integral part of the ex situ collections of the Gardens and holds both short
    and long term collections. Short term seed collections are used for research and
    to support the living collections and nursery with stock of native plant species
    for display, while long term conservation collections are stored to assist in
    safeguarding Australian native plants. Seed collection sites are selected primarily
    for conservation outcomes and therefore often based on the presence of threatened
    species, threatened ecological communities, or significant taxa. Generally seeds
    are collected at a site from a population of 20-30 adult, reproductive plants,
    if available. A small proportion of seed is taken from as many parent plants as
    possible and generally stored as a population collection for a species, from a
    location, at a point in time. There are exceptions, for example some endangered
    species, where samples may be stored as maternal lines instead of population samples.
    The provenance of all wild collected seed (and occasionally cultivated seed) is
    comprehensively recorded and voucher specimens of the species are catalogued in
    the Australian National Herbarium.
  original_file: 4 files in raw data folder
  notes: There are a few species whose seed masses are almost certainly incorrect.
    They've been compared to other AusTraits entries. These values have been manually
    adjusted in AusTraits, 15-02-2022, E Wenk

  methods: 'Thousand seed weight is a measure of the average mass of one thousand
    seeds. Two methods have been historically employed to obtain this data. Basic
    method: Exactly 1000 seeds are separated from the collection as a whole and then
    weighed to give an amount in grams, to 4 decimal places. Replicate method: up
    to 5 replicates of an exact number of seeds (e.g. 25, 50, 100) are weighed; the
    average seed weight is calculated and used to estimate the weight of 1000 seeds
    (in grams to 4 decimal places).; additional data including sample size for each
    observation in raw data files'

- var_in: Width
  unit_in: um
  trait_name: seed_width
  entity_type: population
  value_type: mean
  basis_of_value: measurement
  methods: Calibrated group digital images of 20-30 seeds enable measurements of size
    with calculations of average size and variation among seeds (standard deviation).
    Measurements of seeddimensions width (at widest point) and length (longest point)
    are made concurrently with seed imaging. Measurements are made along straight
    lines and at the maximum extent of each dimension; as opposed to following curvature
    of the seeds or making measurements between precise parts of plant anatomy. These
    gross measurements provide a measure of mean seed size per accession which can
    demonstrate variation within an accession, variation within a species, or can
    be used for comparison across taxonomically diverse groups. Images of special
    features may also be captured if a certain feature is not clearly visible from
    the representative seed or the group image. ^p As a general rule, the current
    gross measurements cover those parts of the dispersal unit derived from the seed
    itself (e.g. wing, aril) but not any parts derived from the flower (e.g. pappus,
    peduncle). Sometimes this distinction is not easy to make, particularly in the
    case of grass 'seed'. Grass seed collections can vary from a seed/caryopsis that
    has been cleaned of any awns/glumes/parts of the spikelet to a dispersal unit
    that still bears firmly attached glumes/palea/lemma and any associated awns. The
    gross measurements may or may not include any of these anatomical parts depending
    on the species, ease of detachment of parts and the level of processing that the
    collection has undergone. ^p The digital images are also annotated with other
    morphological trait data such as overall shape, appendages present, and texture
    of the seed or fruit surface. It should be noted that these descriptive terms
    relate to the seed collection as stored (after drying), and therefore may differ
    from those of the dispersal unit as it is first released from the plant (especially
    in the case of fleshy fruits).
