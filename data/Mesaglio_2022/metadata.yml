  description: A comprehensive biodiversity survey of Wategora Reserve and Everley
    Park along Duck River in western Sydney from 2020 to 2022, spanning an area of
    approximately 25 ha.
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: From 2020-2022 I surveyed Wategora Reserve, and the riparian
    vegetation adjacent to Everley Park directly south of the reserve, recording a
    total of 1930 species. The total survey area was ~0.25 km2 (~25 ha), stretching
    ~1.3 km from north to south, and ~350 m at its widest point. Located in western
    Sydney, New South Wales, the survey area spans the suburbs of Chester Hill, South
    Granville and Auburn, and is under the jurisdiction of Cumberland Council. It
    is in a highly urbanised area, and is surrounded by sporting fields, a golf course,
    and industrial estates and commercial properties. Relative to the previous three
    years, rainfall was very high during my survey - in the six day period from 19-24
    March 2021, 293.9 mm of rain fell. In some parts of Sydney, the first three months
    of 2022 saw ~1200 mm of rainfall, with rainfall already exceeding 2000 mm for
    2022 by October 6th. I conducted surveys during all possible weather conditions,
    including during and immediately after heavy rain. During my survey, I uploaded
    all of my observations as records to the biodiversity citizen science platform
    iNaturalist (see Mesaglio and Callaghan 2021). Because my survey was designed
    to be comprehensive, I did not run any quadrats, transects, etc., but rather continuously
    surveyed the entire reserve ad nauseum. Most of the species I recorded were observed
    through simple active searching, but I also set up a UV lamp and moth sheet during
    many of my night surveys to survey insects. I endeavoured to survey as non-destructively
    as possible, but I did collect some insect specimens to send to experts for identification.
    I also collected a number of plant specimens and deposited them at the NSW Herbarium,
    some for identification and others for their value as vouchers.

  methods: I have provided flowering times for as many native species as possible,
    up until mid-December 2021. For any listed native species without this information,
    I did not observe them flowering during the survey. I also did not provide flowering
    times for any of the listed grass species and some other graminoids, as I did
    not consistently monitor these groups after initially finding each species. Most
    of my reported flowering times are comprehensive, however, times for some species
    may not reflect the entire window due to e.g., having first observed that species
    after it had already started flowering. I refer to flowering for a number of species
    as 'starting again in [date in late 2021]'; these species were still flowering
    when I finished the 'official' period of my survey in mid-December 2021. I noted
    several flowering times for 2022 for species that I only found during this year,
    but otherwise did not list flowering times for 2022 here due to conducting far
    fewer and more inconsistent (timewise) surveys during this year compared to 2021.
