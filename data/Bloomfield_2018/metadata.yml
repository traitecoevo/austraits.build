  description: A field study of leaf trait variation at seven sites spanning a range
    of climates and latitudes across the Australian continent; 80 native plant species
    were included. We measured key traits associated with leaf structure, chemistry
    and metabolism during the favourable and unfavourable growing seasons.
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: 'Our seven study sites are a subset of the Terrestrial Ecosystem
    Research Network (TERN) SuperSites (www.supersites.net.au) (Karan et al., 2016).
    The site locations and key descriptors of dominant vegetation and soil type are
    presented in Table 1. The sites were chosen, from the existing network, to provide
    a wide range in vegetation and environmental conditions, with an emphasis on rainfall
    and temperature variability (Figure S2). Depending on the type of analysis attempted,
    we made use of climate data from a variety of sources. Each SuperSite is equipped
    with a flux tower (TERN OzFlux network) that records a common suite of meteorological
    data (Beringer et al., 2016). Our initial visits preceded the installation of
    the standard OzFlux system at three sites; in those instances, we used the ANUClimate
    model (Hutchinson et al., 2009) and data from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology''s
    nearest weather station. Long-term climate data for each site were obtained from
    interpolated values (covering the period 1970-2012) produced at 0.01deg spatial
    resolution by the TERN eMAST facility (Ecosystem Modelling and Scaling Infrastructure).
    We performed spatial analyses to assemble the seven sites across a matrix of bioclimatic
    indices that emphasized patterns of seasonality in rainfall and temperature (data
    not shown). The degree of similarity among the sites was interpreted using an
    unrooted (phylogenetic-type) tree. Based on the branching observed, we have assigned
    the sites to three clusters: ''arid'' comprising Alice Mulga, Calperum Mallee
    and Great Western Woodlands; ''Temperate'' comprising Cumberland Plain and Warra;
    ''Tropical'' comprising Daintree and Robson Creek. With the exception of Alice
    Mulga, each site was visited on two occasions. The timing of the visits was designed,
    within logistical constraints, to provide the widest possible seasonal contrast.
    The prevailing climate conditions leading up to each campaign are provided in
    Table S1 (Supporting Information). Each visit to a site was designated as either
    the ''Favourable'' or ''Unfavourable'' season based on a local assessment of growing
    conditions. Our study focused on the impact of seasonal contrasts (i.e. subannual)
    on leaf metabolic traits and so the monthly scale has been adopted here to present
    corresponding time-averaged climate conditions, on the basis that 30 days is likely
    to provide sufficient time for acclimation to occur within pre-existing leaves
    of long-lived broadleaved species (Zaragoza-Castells et al., 2008). Overall, Repeat
    measurements of the same plants at two time points in a year: summer or wet season
    and winter or dry season. For the Alice Mulga site we have only one visit, in
    the dry season. Trees and shrubs were selected to include common species that
    provided sufficient replication within the plot (ideally n = 5) and also to provide
    a range of leaf morphology.'

  notes: The data collected in the dry season at Daintree are also in AusTraits are
    part of Weerasinghe_2014. The data are present in both data.csv files, but only
    read into AusTraits through Weerasinghe_2014. In this file, each of the relevant
    columns has been duplicated and in one, the Weerasinghe values have been replaced
    with 'NA'.

  trait_name: photosynthetic_rate_per_area_saturated
  value_type: raw_value
  replicates: 1
  methods: At each visit, we chose young, fully developed leaves from two sun exposed
    branches of each selected tree. Leaf gas exchange measurements were concentrated
    in the morning. Sun exposed branches were excised and the cut end of the branches
    immediately placed in a bucket and then recut under water to re-establish the
    xylem water column. For each leaf, approximately light-saturated (1500 umol photons
    m-2 s-1) measures of net photosynthesis were taken at ambient CO2 concentration,
    400 umol mol-1 (ppm) (A400) and then at 1500 ppm (A1500). The leaf was next wrapped
    in aluminium foil for 30 minutes before respiration in darkness (Rdark) was measured,
    still at 400 ppm CO2. Air flow was held constant and a constant chamber block
    temperature was adopted, set marginally (ca. deg C) higher than expected morning
    air temperatures to counter the effect of transpirational cooling and to ensure
    leaf and ambient air temperatures were similar.

    400 umol mol-1 (ppm) (A400) and then at 1500 ppm (A1500). The leaf was next wrapped
    in aluminium foil for 30 minutes before respiration in darkness (Rdark) was measured,
    still at 400 ppm CO2. Air flow was held constant and a constant chamber block
    temperature was adopted, set marginally (ca. deg C) higher than expected morning
    air temperatures to counter the effect of transpirational cooling and to ensure
    leaf and ambient air temperatures were similar.

  methods: At each visit, we chose young, fully developed leaves from two sun exposed
    branches of each selected tree. Leaf gas exchange measurements were concentrated
    in the morning. Sun exposed branches were excised and the cut end of the branches
    immediately placed in a bucket and then recut under water to re-establish the
    xylem water column. For each leaf, approximately light-saturated (1500 umol photons
    m-2 s-1) measures of net photosynthesis were taken at ambient CO2 concentration,
    400 umol mol-1 (ppm) (A400) and then at 1500 ppm (A1500). The leaf was next wrapped

    was hot-digested in acid-peroxide before colorimetric analysis using a flow injection
    system (QuikChem 8500, Lachat Instruments, Loveland, Colorado, USA).
