  description: Study investigating variation in key hydraulic and carbon economy traits
    of 12 woody species in Australia across a broad climatic gradient, using a common
    garden approach.
  basis_of_record: captive_cultivated
  life_stage: sapling
  sampling_strategy: Plant material and experimental design ^p Twelve dominant tree
    species, representing five major woody vegetation types in NSW, Australia, were
    chosen for the present study (Table 1). Species vary markedly in climate-of-origin,
    with mean annual temperature (MAT) ranging from 10 to 20.5 °C and mean annual
    precipitation (MAP) ranging from 188 to 1,125 mm. Aridity index (AI), calculated
    as the ratio of MAP and potential evaporation, varies between 0.1 (most arid)
    for Acacia aneura and 1.1 (least arid) for Eucalyptus viminalis. Differences in
    climate-of-origin across species reflect differences in their native geographical
    distribution range (Figure S1). Rainforest and wet sclerophyll forest species
    are distributed along the eastern coastline of Australia, with the distribution
    of E. viminalis extending south to Tasmania. Semiarid woodland species occur in
    the drier inland areas, and A. aneura (mulga) has the widest distribution range
    of the 12 species, occurring across much of outback Australia. Seeds were obtained
    from Mount Annan Botanic Garden (Mount Annan, NSW, Australia, Table S2) and sown
    in forestry tubes in a sunlit polytunnel provided by Greening Australia (Richmond,
    NSW, Australia). On March 15, 2016, when seedlings were approximately 15 cm tall,
    plants were moved to the polytunnel facility of Western Sydney University (33o33'S,
    150o44'E, Richmond, NSW, Australia) and transplanted into 25-L bags filled with
    roughly 20 kg of loamy sand soil. The bags were isolated from the ground by palettes
    to prevent roots spreading beyond the pots. Each species was represented by 24
    individuals, with the exception of Eucalyptus populnea and Eucalyptus macrorhyncha,
    which were represented by 17 and 18 individuals, respectively. All plants were
    fertilized 3 days after transplanting with soluble fertilizer and fertilized fortnightly
    until May 2016. Thereafter, plants were provided with commercial controlled release
    fertilizer (Osmocote, All purpose, Scotts, Australia) to ensure that they were
    not nutrient limited. All plants were watered for 10 min every other day using
    an irrigation system to maintain soil water content at field capacity. A randomized
    block design was adopted to minimize climatic variation in the polytunnel, which
    was divided into six blocks. Three or four plants of each species were randomly
    allocated to each block. Four individuals of each species were assigned to a well-watered
    treatment and were watered daily over the experimental period. The remaining individuals
    were assigned to a drought treatment. The unbalanced allocation of individuals
    to treatments enabled drought plants to be destructively sampled across a range
    of xylem water potentials during soil drying. Due to differences in growth rate
    between species, the drought treatment was applied separately to three groups
    of three to five species at different time periods. The drought treatment was
    implemented by withholding irrigation during two drought cycles. In the first
    drought cycle, plants were dried until leaves were visually wilting. Thereafter,
    irrigation resumed, and plants were watered daily for 10 days to allow full recovery.
    In the second drought cycle, irrigation was discontinued, and the plants were
    allowed to dry down. During this phase, leaf gas exchange characteristics and
    corresponding leaf water potential (Psi leaf, MPa) were measured periodically
    until positive net photosynthesis (Amax, umol m-2 s-1) was no longer detectable.
    Photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD, umol m-2 s-1), air temperature (Tair,
    °C), and relative humidity (RH, %) were monitored in the polytunnel at 1.5 m height
    using a temperature/humidity probe (HMP60-L, Campbell Scientific Inc., Logan,
    UT, USA) and PPFD sensor (Decagon Devices Inc., Pullman, WA, USA) and were logged
    every 15 min with a data-logger (CR300, Campdell Scientific Inc.). Mean daily
    PPFD during the experimental period (i.e., December 2017 to May 2017) was 6.24
    mol day-1. Average Tair and RH were 20.2 °C and 65%, respectively.

  methods: Stem vulnerability curves ^p Stem vulnerability curves were constructed
    for each species by slowly dehydrating whole plants in 25-L pots (Martorell, Diaz-Espejo,
    Medrano, Ball, & Choat, 2014; Sperry, Donnelly, & Tyree, 1988). Stem samples were
    prepared for hydraulic measurement following Wheeler, Huggett, Tofte, Rockwell,
    and Holbrook (2013) and Torres-Ruiz et al. (2015). Excising stem segments under
    high xylem tension may allow air bubbles to enter the stem xylem even if performed
    under water, consequently leading to an overestimation of the level of embolism.
    To avoid this "cutting" artefact, stem samples were rehydrated for at least 2
    hr before sample preparation by placing plants in darkness with the cut surface
    submerged in water. Xylem tension was considered sufficiently relaxed when Psi
    leaf was higher than -1 MPa; thereafter, a 10- to 15-cm stem segment was targeted
    for xylem hydraulic conductivity measurements. Side branches were removed, and
    the cut surfaces sealed with parafilm, if necessary. The first cut was made to
    the upstream end of the branch, at least 30 cm from the targeted segment, and
    then left to rehydrate for 10 min. Subsequent cuts were made at approximately
    2-min intervals, alternating between upstream and downstream ends of the segment.
    Once the desired stem length was achieved, the sample was labelled and connected
    to a pressure head (0.002 MPa) generated gravitationally, and the initial flow
    rate (Kinitial) was measured using a digital liquid flow meter (Liqui-Flow L10,
    Bronkhorst High-Tech BV, Ruurlo, Gelderland, The Netherlands) connected to flow
    analysis programs FlowDDE and FlowPlot (Version 4.69 and 3.34, respectively, Bronkhorst,
    FlowWare, http://downloads.bronhorst.com). Thereafter, the stem segment was attached
    to a water tank filled with 2-mmol KCL solution. The segment was flushed with
    a pressure of 200 kPa for at least 30 min to remove any embolism and then connected
    again to the flow meter to measure final flowrate (Kfinal). Kfinal was normalized
    by the pressure gradient, sapwood area, and stem length to obtain initial and
    final xylem-specific hydraulic conductivity (Ks, kg m-1 s-1 MPa-1). Percentage
    loss of xylem conductivity (%) was calculated as percentage loss of xylem conductivity
    = (1 - Kinitial/Kfinal) x 100. Stem vulnerability curves were fitted using the
    Weibull function, and key traits (i.e., P12, P50, P88; Table 2) were statistically
    tested by comparing bootstrap confidence intervals.

  methods: Gas exchange measurements ^p Gas exchange measurements were conducted on
    recent, fully expanded leaves. During drought stress, the healthiest fully expanded
    leaf on each individual plant was chosen. Leaf gas exchange was measured using
    a portable infrared gas analyser (Model 6400XT, Li-Cor, Lincoln, NE, USA) equipped
    with the red-blue LED light source (6400-02B) and external CO2 injector. Leaf
    net carbon assimilation rate (An), stomatal conductance (gs, mol m-2 s-1), and
    leaf transpiration rate (E, mmol m-2 s-1) were measured by placing the leaf into
    a 2 x 3 cm cuvette supplied with saturating light (1,500 umol m-2 s-1) and ambient
    CO2 concentration (420 umol mol-1). Parameters were logged when readings were
    visually stable (total coefficient of variation < 1), which was typically achieved
    within 5 min. During these measurements, cuvette temperature was maintained at
    25 °C, flow rate was set at 500 ml min-1, and RH in the cuvette was maintained
    between 60% and 70%. A leakage correction was applied on Li-Cor 6400XT data according
    to the manual, assuming a constant ambient CO2 concentration (420 umol mol-1).
    Immediately after each gas exchange measurement, leaves were excised and placed
    in a zip-lock bag humidified with moist paper towel and transported to the lab
    in an ice-filled container for Psi leaf measurements. Psi leaf was measured using
    a Scholander-type pressure chamber (PMS Instruments, Corvalis, OR, USA). Stomatal
    conductance was plotted against leaf water potential and fitted with a weighted
    polynomial regression to extract Pgs50 and Pgs90 (Table 2). All curve fittings
    were performed using R with the fitplc package (Duursma & Choat, 2017).

  methods: Hydraulic capacitance ^p Whole branch hydraulic capacitance (Cbranch) was
    measured on well-watered plants using the bench dehydration method. The aboveground
    portion of the plant was excised at predawn (when xylem tension was minimal),
    covered by an opaque plastic bag, and transported to the lab where branch FW and
    Psi leaf were immediately measured. Samples were allowed to slowly dehydrate under
    lab conditions, during which time Psi stem and branch fresh mass were regularly
    measured. Before each measurement, the branch was placed into a sealed plastic
    bag for roughly 1 hr to ensure equilibration between Psi leaf and Psi stem. Afterwards,
    branch samples were oven dried at 70 °C until mass was constant. Branch RWC (RWCbranch,
    %) at each measurement period was calculated and plotted against Psi stem. Cbranch
    was estimated as the slope of the second linear portion of the water release curve,
    expressed as DeltaRWC/DeltaPsi  (RWC MPa-1).

  methods: Pressure volume analysis ^p For each species, one leaf per well-watered
    plant was collected for leaf pressure volume (PV) determination; for species with
    reduced leaf petioles, a terminal shoot was used instead. Leaves were excised
    under water in the early morning and transported to the lab with the petiole kept
    under water. Samples were placed in opaque plastic bags for up to 3 hr to ensure
    maximum rehydration. Leaf PV curves were generated following Maréchaux et al.
    (2015). Briefly, Psi leaf was measured using the Scholander pressure chamber,
    and fresh weight (FW) was measured with a digital balance (weighed to 0.1 mg).
    Then, leaves were bench dried with Psi leaf, and FW measured periodically. Finally,
    leaves were oven dried at 70 °C for at least 48 hr to obtain dry weight. Leaf
    PV traits were estimated as described by Lenz, Wright, and Westoby (2006). The
    inverse of leaf water potential (1/Psi leaf) was plotted against leaf relative
    water content (RWCleaf, %) to facilitate calculation. Leaf TLP (MPa) was taken
    as the point where the line became non-linear.

    a pressure of 200 kPa for at least 30 min to remove any embolism and then connected
    again to the flow meter to measure final flowrate (Kfinal). Kfinal was normalized
    by the pressure gradient, sapwood area, and stem length to obtain initial and
    final xylem-specific hydraulic conductivity (Ks, kg m-1 s-1 MPa-1).

  methods: Maximum carbon assimilation rate under well-watered conditions; Gas exchange
    measurements ^p Gas exchange measurements were conducted on recent, fully expanded
    leaves. During drought stress, the healthiest fully expanded leaf on each individual
    plant was chosen. Leaf gas exchange was measured using a portable infrared gas
    analyser (Model 6400XT, Li-Cor, Lincoln, NE, USA) equipped with the red-blue LED
    light source (6400-02B) and external CO2 injector. Leaf net carbon assimilation
    rate (An), stomatal conductance (gs, mol m-2 s-1), and leaf transpiration rate
    (E, mmol m-2 s-1) were measured by placing the leaf into a 2 x 3 cm cuvette supplied
    with saturating light (1,500 umol m-2 s-1) and ambient CO2 concentration (420
    umol mol-1). Parameters were logged when readings were visually stable (total
    coefficient of variation < 1), which was typically achieved within 5 min. During
    these measurements, cuvette temperature was maintained at 25 °C, flow rate was
    set at 500 ml min-1, and RH in the cuvette was maintained between 60% and 70%.
    A leakage correction was applied on Li-Cor 6400XT data according to the manual,
    assuming a constant ambient CO2 concentration (420 umol mol-1).

    each gas exchange measurement, leaves were excised and placed in a zip-lock bag
    humidified with moist paper towel and transported to the lab in an ice-filled
    container for Psi leaf measurements. Psi leaf was measured using a Scholander-type
    pressure chamber (PMS Instruments, Corvalis, OR, USA).

  methods: An approximately 4-cm-long segment was collected from the basal region
    of the stem. Bark was carefully removed with a razor blade, and sapwood fresh
    volume was determined using the water displacement method (Markesteijn et al.,
    2011). Then all samples were oven dried at 70°C for 48 hr to constant mass and
    then weighed. Specific leaf area (m2 kg-1) was calculated as the ratio of leaf
    area to dry mass. WD was calculated as the ratio of dry mass to fresh volume (g
    cm-3).

  methods: Following stem hydraulic measurements, plants were separated into leaves
    and stems. Leaf samples were further divided according to leaf position relative
    to the stem segment used for hydraulic measurement. A representative subsample
    of fresh leaves was collected from four per plants per species, and leaf area
    was measured using a leaf area meter (LI-3100A, Li-Cor Inc., USA). In addition,
    an approximately 4-cm-long segment was collected from the basal region of the
    stem. Bark was carefully removed with a razor blade, and sapwood fresh volume
    was determined using the water displacement method (Markesteijn et al., 2011).

  methods: Plant height (H, cm) and basal diameter (D, mm) were measured monthly from
    May to November 2016. Basal diameter was measured at 3 cm above soil level. A
    stem volume index was calculated as H x D2 (cm3), and a volume index growth rate
    (VIGR, cm3 day-1) was calculated as the incremental increase in stem volume between
    measurement periods divided by the number of days between measurements.
