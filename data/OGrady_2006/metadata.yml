  description: The principal aim of this study was to examine spatial and temporal
    patterns of water use in two riparian tree species, Melaleuca argentea W. Fitzg.
    and Corymbia bella Hill and Johnson, along the Daly River in northern Australia.

  sampling_strategy: Site description ^p The Daly River is one of the Northern Territory's
    largest perennial rivers, with a catchment area of about 52,577 km 2 (Figure 1).
    The river is a significant biological, cultural and economic resource. Climate
    within the Daly River region is dominated by a distinct monsoonal wet season occurring
    from October to April followed by a prolonged dry season with little or no rainfall.
    Annual rainfall varies spatially within the catchment and ranges between 1000
    and 1300 mm. Pan evaporation rates are high throughout the year, as are temperatures.
    Climatic variables for Wooliana, about 55 km downstream of the Douglas and Daly
    river confluence, are shown in Figure 2. ^p Catchment discharge is highly variable,
    reflecting the variable annual rainfall patterns within the region. Furthermore,
    there is strong connectivity between surface water and groundwater. As a result,
    groundwater levels vary annually and are principally a function of the amount
    of rainfall in the preceding wet seasons (P. Jolly, Northern Territory Department
    of Lands, Planning and Environment, unpublished data). During the wet season,
    a large proportion of water entering the river is derived from rainfall and surface
    runoff dominates river flow. However, during the dry season, base flow within
    the river is dominated by groundwater discharge from underlying lime-stone aquifers
    (Faulkes 1998) ^p Riparian vegetation along the Daly River varies in width from
    a single line of trees to dense, closed forests along the levee banks and it contains
    many species typical of closed-monsoon forests (Faulkes 1998). Riverbanks are
    steep and rise in a series of terraces from the river. Melaleuca argentea and
    Melaleuca leucadendra L. trees occur on the lower river banks. Behind the strip
    of Melaleuca trees, closed-monsoon forest communities dominate river terraces.
    Open-forest communities occur along the levee banks (about 20 m above river base
    flow) and tend to be dominated by Corymbia bella; however, other species commonly
    found in savanna woodlands also occur. Faulkes (1998) has mapped in detail the
    cross-sectional vegetation profiles within all major rivers and tributaries in
    the Daly River catchment. All plant water use and leaf water potential measurements
    were conducted at three sites along the Daly River, (1) Dorisvale crossing; (2)
    downstream from Oolloo crossing; and (3) at the confluence of the Douglas and
    Daly Rivers (Figure 1). These river sites were chosen to characterize spatial
    variability in tree water use along the river and because they could be accessed
    for most of the year, including the wet season when much of this remote river
    system is inaccessible.

  entity_type: population

  basis_of_value: measurement

  methods: On each sampling date, leaf water potential was measured on three leaves
    from each of four trees per species at all sites. Measurements of leaf water potential
    were conducted in July-August 2000 (dry season), September-October 2000 (end of
    dry season) and in May 2001 (beginning of dry season). Measurements commenced
    predawn and were thereafter conduct ed at about hourly intervals until midday.
    Leaves were harvested from trees for which tree water use was being concurrently
    estimated. Harvested leaves were immediately placed in humid bags that were sealed
    and stored in a dark, insulated container to ensure that leaves were not rapidly
    transpiring during measurement (Turner and Long 1980). All measurements were made
    within 30 min of collection with a Scholander type pressure chamber (Soil Moisture
    Equipment Corporation, Santa Barbara, CA). Although it would have been preferable
    to measure water potentials on covered or shaded leaves (Meinzer et al. 2001,
    David et al. 2004), the canopies of these species are quite sparse and so selecting
    shaded leaves that were not actively transpiring was not feasible. In addition,
    canopy heights and steep riverbanks severely restricted access to the canopy.

  methods: Tree water use was examined in each of four C. bella and M. argentea trees
    at each site (Figure 1). Sampling was conducted during the dry season (July-August
    2000), at the end of the dry season (September-October 2000) and at the beginning
    of the next dry season (May 2001). Tree water use was estimated with commercially
    available sap flow loggers (Greenspan Sap flow, Greenspan Technology Warwick QLD,
    Australia). Sap velocity was measured radially across the sapwood at four points.
    A 1.8-s heat pulse was fired at 15-min intervals over a 5-day period in each tree
    at each site during each of the sampling periods. Heat pulse velocity was converted
    to sap velocity following Edwards and Warwick (1984). Swanson and Whitfield (1981)
    solutions were used to correct heat pulse velocity for the effects of wounding
    (wound diameter = 3.1 mm). Sapwood area was determined by taking cores from each
    tree, and sapwood was distinguished from heartwood on the basis of a distinct
    colour change. These cores were used for determination of the volumetric wood
    and water contents of each sampled tree. Sap velocity was scaled to tree water
    use by the weighted averages technique (Hatton et al. 1990). For each tree, diameter
    at 1.3 m was recorded and bark thickness and depth of sapwood were also recorded.
    ^p Comparisons between water use expressed on a sapwood area basis and leaf water
    potential were made by taking the mean of 15-min fluxes from before and after
    the time leaves were sampled for leaf water potential. The slope of the relationship
    between water use and leaf water potential was used as an estimate of hydraulic
    conductance, expressed in units of kg s-1 m-2 MPa-1 to facilitate comparison with
    previously reported values of hydraulic conductance. We also used the relationship
    between sap flow and leaf water potential to predict the leaf water potential
    at zero flow (Bucci et al. 2004, O'Grady et al. 2006).
