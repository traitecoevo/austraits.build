  description: A study exploring how traits associated with PPUE, photosynthetic nitrogen
    (N)-use efficiency (PNUE) and leaf respiration might converge along the  chronosequence,
    and whether Proteaceae and non-Proteaceae species differ in leaf traits associated
    with nutrient use.
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: We focused on three sites, representing three of the chronosequence
    stages as defined in previous papers on the Jurien Bay chronosequence (Laliberte
    et al., 2012; Turner et al., 2018). Stage 1 refers to the progressive phase of
    very young dunes, where plant growth is limited by N; stage 3 represents the retrogressive
    phase of intermediate-aged dunes, where plant productivity is co-limited by N
    and P; while stage 4 represents old dunes, where P is the main macronutrient limiting
    plant productivity (Laliberte et al., 2012). At each chronosequence stage, seven
    to 10 species were sampled that were common enough to allow sufficient replication
    (Table 1). At each chronosequence stage, we sought to include a range of species
    with contrasting LMA values to enable testing of relationships between leaf structure
    and function.

  methods: Leaf material from the gas exchange, LMA, FMA, and DMC measurements was
    used to analyse leaf nutrients. All leaf samples were ovendried (70 deg C, 48
    hr) and finely ground in a vertical ball-mill grinder and analysed for tissue
    [N] and [P] using Kjeldahl acid digests (Allen, Grimshaw, Parkinson, & Quarmby,
    1974) and a LaChat QuikChem 8500 Series 2 Flow Injection Analysis System (LaChat
    Instruments, Wisconsin, USA). Leaf [P] obtained via initial nutrient analysis
    were inconsistent due to analytical issues, without sufficient original leaf material
    left for a reanalysis. To address the absence of leaf [P] data from the 2011 samples,
    and also to calculate nutrient-resorption efficiency and proficiency values, mature
    and senesced leaves were collected from each individual plant in February 2015;
    these samples were collected from the same sites where the 2011 gas exchange measurements
    were taken. Leaf [P] is remarkably invariant from year to year along the Jurien
    Bay chronosequence (Table S1, Figure S1), and very similar to values obtained
    before on similar sites in this severely P-impoverished region (Denton et al.,
    2007; Sulpice et al., 2014; Wright et al., 2004). The temporal stability and location-specific
    nature of leaf [P] data justified sampling leaf P in February, 2015, and relating
    these values to gas exchange data from November, 2011. At each site, five healthy
    mature individuals were selected for most of the 2011 sampled species. As was
    the case in 2011, mature leaves were undamaged, fully expanded, and sun-exposed,
    from the youngest, fully matured cohort. Senesced leaves were identified as being
    yellow or brown and detached easily from the plant. Where possible, senesced leaves
    were collected directly from the plant by gently shaking the plant and collection
    of fallen leaves; alternatively, where this was not possible, senesced leaves
    were collected directly from recently fallen litter beneath the plant. Senesced
    leaves collected from this litter showed no visible degradation, and because they
    had likely fallen over summer, they had not been exposed to any significant rain
    between litter fall and collection. We therefore assume a minimal loss of nutrients
    through leaching or decomposition, although some photodegradation may have occurred
    (Austin & Vivanco, 2006; Gliksman et al., 2016). A total of 180 leaf samples (mature
    and senesced) were collected for nutrient analysis in 2015; both sets of leaves
    were oven-dried (70 deg C, 48 hr) and finely ground in a vertical ball-mill grinder
    using plastic vials and yttriastabilized zirconia ceramic beads. A subsample was
    acid digested using concentrated HNO3:HClO4 (3:1) and the leaf [P] determined
    colourimetrically using malachite green method (Motomizu, Wakimoto, & Toei, 1983).

  methods: We quantified light-saturated net rates of leaf photosynthesis, under both
    ambient and saturating CO2 concentrations (Asat and Amax, respectively) after
    which dark respiration was measured (Rd). Leaf-level gas exchange measurements
    were made with an infrared gas analysis system (LI-COR 6400XT; LI-COR Inc., Lincoln
    NE, USA), incorporating CO2 control and a 6 cm2 chamber, with a red-blue light
    source (6400-02B). All measurements were made from 11 to 17 November 2011, towards
    the end of the rainy season in this Mediterranean environment. All in situ gas
    exchange measurements were made between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. at a block temperature
    of 28 deg C. Light-saturated photosynthesis (A) was measured at 1,800 umol m-2
    s-1 photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) at a relative humidity of 60%-70%.
    Measurements of A were first made at an atmospheric CO2 concentration of 400 umol/mol
    CO2 (Asat); thereafter A was measured at elevated CO2 of 1,500 umol/ mol CO2 (Amax);
    finally, leaf respiration in darkness (Rd) was measured after allowing at least
    30 min of darkness before measurements commenced. Asat, Amax and Rd were subsequently
    expressed on leaf area (Asat,a, Amax,a and Rd,a), mass (Asat,m, Amax,m and Rd,m),
    nitrogen (PNUEsat, PNUEmax and Rd,N) and phosphorus (PPUEsat, PPUEmax and Rd,P)
    bases. Measurements were made using undamaged, fully expanded, youngest fully

    were made with an infrared gas analysis system (LI-COR 6400XT; LI-COR Inc., Lincoln
    NE, USA), incorporating CO2 control and a 6 cm2 chamber, with a red-blue light
    source (6400-02B). All measurements were made from 11 to 17 November 2011, towards
    the end of the rainy season in this Mediterranean environment. All in situ gas
    exchange measurements were made between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. at a block temperature
    of 28 deg C. Light-saturated photosynthesis (A) was measured at 1,800 umol m-2
    s-1 photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) at a relative humidity of 60%-70%.
    Measurements of A were first made at an atmospheric CO2 concentration of 400 umol/mol
    CO2 (Asat); thereafter A was measured at elevated CO2 of 1,500 umol/ mol CO2 (Amax);
    finally, leaf respiration in darkness (Rd) was measured after allowing at least
    30 min of darkness before measurements commenced. Asat, Amax and Rd were subsequently
    expressed on leaf area (Asat,a, Amax,a and Rd,a), mass (Asat,m, Amax,m and Rd,m),
    nitrogen (PNUEsat, PNUEmax and Rd,N) and phosphorus (PPUEsat, PPUEmax and Rd,P)
    bases. Measurements were made using undamaged, fully expanded, youngest fully
    mature and sun-exposed leaves, still attached to the plant.

  methods: Leaf material from the gas exchange, LMA, FMA, and DMC measurements was
    used to analyse leaf nutrients. All leaf samples were ovendried (70 deg C, 48
    hr) and finely ground in a vertical ball-mill grinder and analysed for tissue
    [N] and [P] using Kjeldahl acid digests (Allen, Grimshaw, Parkinson, & Quarmby,
    1974) and a LaChat QuikChem 8500 Series 2 Flow Injection Analysis System (LaChat
    Instruments, Wisconsin, USA). Leaf [P] obtained via initial nutrient analysis
    were inconsistent due to analytical issues, without sufficient original leaf material
    left for a reanalysis. To address the absence of leaf [P] data from the 2011 samples,
    and also to calculate nutrient-resorption efficiency and proficiency values, mature
    and senesced leaves were collected from each individual plant in February 2015;
    these samples were collected from the same sites where the 2011 gas exchange measurements
    were taken. Leaf [P] is remarkably invariant from year to year along the Jurien
    Bay chronosequence (Table S1, Figure S1), and very similar to values obtained
    before on similar sites in this severely P-impoverished region (Denton et al.,
    2007; Sulpice et al., 2014; Wright et al., 2004). The temporal stability and location-specific
    nature of leaf [P] data justified sampling leaf P in February, 2015, and relating
    these values to gas exchange data from November, 2011. At each site, five healthy
    mature individuals were selected for most of the 2011 sampled species. As was
    the case in 2011, mature leaves were undamaged, fully expanded, and sun-exposed,
    from the youngest, fully matured cohort. Senesced leaves were identified as being
    yellow or brown and detached easily from the plant. Where possible, senesced leaves
    were collected directly from the plant by gently shaking the plant and collection
    of fallen leaves; alternatively, where this was not possible, senesced leaves
    were collected directly from recently fallen litter beneath the plant. Senesced
    leaves collected from this litter showed no visible degradation, and because they
    had likely fallen over summer, they had not been exposed to any significant rain
    between litter fall and collection. We therefore assume a minimal loss of nutrients
    through leaching or decomposition, although some photodegradation may have occurred
    (Austin & Vivanco, 2006; Gliksman et al., 2016). A total of 180 leaf samples (mature
    and senesced) were collected for nutrient analysis in 2015; both sets of leaves
    were oven-dried (70 deg C, 48 hr) and finely ground in a vertical ball-mill grinder
    using plastic vials and yttriastabilized zirconia ceramic beads. A subsample was
    acid digested using concentrated HNO3:HClO4 (3:1) and the leaf [P] determined
    colourimetrically using malachite green method (Motomizu, Wakimoto, & Toei, 1983).
