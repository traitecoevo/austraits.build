  description: trait data from field campaigns by Erica Williams in Westoby lab from Mt Wellington
    and Sea Acres NP
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: The Mount Wellington study site was located in south-eastern
    Tasmania, approximately 15km from Hobart (1245 m a.s.l.). The study site was on
    soil derived from Jurassic dolerite and the vegetation was representative of the
    dominant vegetation of alpine and sub-alpine Mt. Wellington. The Mt Wellington
    summit plateau has had relatively frequent fires and the study site was almost
    certainly completely burnt in 1967. ^p Species details, From Sea Acres Nature
    Reserve (SA), 15 species from nine families were sampled during August and September
    2003. From Mt Wellington (MW), 17 species from eight families were sampled during
    December 2003. From each site, three individuals per species were sampled (see
    Table 1 for species details). Understorey shrubs were sampled from ground level
    while tall shrubs and small trees were sampled from the canopy boardwalk (SA only).
    Species were sampled only when at least 60% of maximum height was reached; mean
    species average heights ranged from 3 (Citriobatus pauciflorus) - 14 m (Ficus
    fraseri) at SA and from prostrate shrubs to small trees (Eucalyptus coccifera;
    3m) at MW. ^p Sampling strategy, Approximately 1m of branching sequence was cut
    from each individual and divided up into 5-6 segments, with approximately equal
    side branches on each segment. At each cut, the long and short diameters of sapwood
    (underneath the bark) were measured. Biomass was separated into main stem and
    side branches and transferred into pre-labelled paper bags. Bags were refrigerated
    until transferred to a drying oven. Samples were dried at 60C for approximately
    one week. Leaves and trigs were manually separated and weighed. Dry masses from
    successive segments were added to give cumulative biomass distal to each diameter
    as per Pickup (in prep). Cumulative leaf mass and cumulative stem mass was calculated
    for the main stem and for the main plus side branches.

  methods: From each branching sequence, 6 sun leaves were collected and stored in
    plastic bags, following Cornelissen manual. The adaxial surface of the leaves
    were scanned and mean leaf area (mm2) calculated using Delta T Scan software.
    Leaves were then oven dried for 2 days at 60C and Specific Leaf Area calculated
    as leaf area/fresh weight.

  methods: From each branching sequence, a 4-6 cm segment of wood was cut at 1m. Samples
    were placed in plastic bags and were refrigerated until processed. After removing
    the bark, long and short diameter and segment length were measured. The segment
    was then submerged in a water-filled measuring cylinder on a balance using a pin
    and a piece of cotton. Samples were then oven dried at 60C for four days and weighed.
    Stem density was calculated as dry mass/fresh volume conductive tissue (bark excluded).
