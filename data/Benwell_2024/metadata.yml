  description: A study that aimed to examine rates of seedling recruitment and resprouting in functional and phytogeographic components of wet sclerophyll forest (WSRf), and adjacent open forest (OF) and rock outcrop shrubland (RO).
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: Study site and vegetation ^p The Nightcap Range (28.58S, 153.37E; Fig. 1) has an elevation of 200-900 m and a mean annual rainfall of 1800-2500 mm. Soils are brown podzols of low to medium fertility formed on rhyolite, with smaller areas of higher fertility, red-brown krasnozem on intermediate to basic volcanics (Stevens 1976; Australian Government 1992). The major vegetation formations in the order of extent are wet sclerophyll forest, dry sclerophyll forest, rainforest and rock outcrop shrubland (FCNSW 1989). High rainfall and a warm subtropical climate promote rainforest development, whereas low-nutrient substrates favour sclerophyll vegetation (Beadle 1954; Adam 1992). In the Nightcap Range, the rainforest flora occurs both in rainforest, a closed canopy formation and extensively in wet sclerophyll-rainforest (WSRf) as an understorey below a very tall, open forest canopy of myrtaceous brush box (Lophostemon confertus), turpentine (Syncarpia glomulifera), blackbutt (Eucalyptus pilularis), flooded gum (Eucalyptus grandis), tallowwood (Eucalyptus microcorys), pink bloodwood (Corymbia intermedia) and at high-elevation New England blackbutt (Eucalyptus campanulata). Accumulation of sclerophyll litter produced by the upper stratum of WSRf may increase bushfire penetration, but this is counteracted by the mesophytic understorey flora and microclimate, which dampen fire spread and intensity. Drier sclerophyll forest dominated mainly by blackbutt, and patches of rock outcrop shrubland cover the ridge lines and most of the northern flanks of the range. ^p 2019 bushfire and fire history ^p Extremely dry conditions developed in eastern NSW and south-eastern Queensland in 2019 because of a positive Indian Ocean Dipole and Sudden Stratospheric Warming above Antarctica (BOM 2019). The forest fire-danger index in the Richmond-Tweed region was the highest on record and spring rainfall one of the lowest. Lightening ignited the Nightcap Range fire in November 2019, which was fanned by moderate, 40-50 km/h NW winds and 5% relative humidity (M. Wiseman, NPWS, pers. comm.). ^p Major fires in the Nightcap Range before 2019 occurred in 1968 and 1926, a fire interval of 40-50 years. The drier northern slopes of the range were also burnt in the 1990s (M. Wiseman, NPWS, pers. comm.). Rainfall data for Mullumbimby near the base of the range show that annual rainfall fell well below average and vegetation was dry enough for bushfire at intervals of 4-25 years between 1898 and 1988, although fire frequency at a specific location will be lower because of several factors. By carbon dating soil charcoal layers in the Nightcap Range, Turner (1984) estimated the frequency of intense fire in brush box forest at 325-380 years and in blackbutt at 280 years. Of eight major wildfires in 3000 years, only one fire approximately 1100 years ago penetrated rainforest. Wildfire appears to be part of the Nightcap Range environment, although fires recur under a low-frequency fire regime. ^p Survey design ^p Species fire responses after the 2019 fire were sampled in 45 plots, 36 in WSRf, four in drier open forest and five in rock outcrop shrubland, which included rock pavement and fringing woodland (Benwell 2007). The sampling focused on WSRf, because primary interest was in how rainforest and sclerophyll floristic components in this vegetation type responded to fire. To compare fire impact and species responses in different habitats, samples were also taken from adjacent drier OF and RO. The higher plot number in WSRf aimed to maximise the number of species captured and reduce the standard error of sampled resprouting and seedling recruitment traits as far as practicable, given limited time and resources. ^p Sites carrying a well-developed rainforest understorey were selected in WSF (i.e. WSRf), where the 6-15+ m high mid-stratum of rainforest trees, shrubs, palms and vines had been burnt, scorched or defoliated. Sites were stratified to include lower to mid-slopes of varying aspect and most were on rhyolite geology and brown podzolic soil, with a few on small areas of red-brown soil on intermediate volcanics. Plots were at elevations of 250 m to 600 m asl (Fig. 1). More lightly burnt WSF and true rainforest with a closed canopy and without sclerophyll emergents were not sampled because fire damage was either very light or absent, the fire extinguishing on the rainforest edge or a short distance inside. ^p Data collection ^p Stem mortality and resprouting were recorded in 20 m x 6 m plots and seedling recruitment in five 1 m x 1 m subplots. The height, diameter at breast height and species of all live and dead stems in plots were recorded and each stem was assigned to one of the following three regenerative classes, (1) stem 100% defoliated, plant resprouting, (2) stem dead (defoliated, plant not resprouting) and (3) foliage crown unburnt and intact, lower trunk with or without visible scorching. Presence of minor basal resprouts on individuals in (3) was also recorded. 'Defoliated' meant all foliage was dead, either scorched and still attached to the stem, shed as litter, or combusted by the fire. The mode of resprouting of live stems was recorded as basal, epicormic or root sucker. Because the fire reached only moderate intensity in WSRf, dead stems assumed to be alive and 'green' when burnt were left standing in a mummified state, and, combined with live stems, provided a record of approximate forest structure at the time of fire. Dead stems were identified to species from dead leaves still attached to stems, bark texture, stem blaze and smell, stem form and branching architecture. Unidentified stems were recorded as unknowns. Stem data were recorded by plot quarter to facilitate relocating individuals 2 years after fire. Vines and herbaceous perennials resprouting in plots were recorded as present and notes were made on the mode of resprouting and relative abundance. ^p Seedling recruitment was recorded in five 1 m x 1 m subplots placed 4 m apart along the centre line of each plot. Seedlings were identified from their cotyledons and first true leaves and counts of each species recorded along with identification features. Seedlings of unidentified species were given a temporary name, collected outside plots and grown-on in a nursery for identification. Monocots without obvious cotyledons and several dicots were excavated to confirm that they were seedlings and not small resprouts from roots, rhizomes, or corms. Marker stakes were installed at the corners of each subplot. Plots and seedling subplots were recorded 6-12 months and 18-24 months after fire. In Year 2, stems recorded in Year 1 were identified using species, height, diameter, regeneration mode and plot quarter data and re-recorded. Species identification was checked and any additional mortalities, late resprouts (usually small plants), number of root suckers and condition of epicormic resprouts were noted. Counts of seedlings and the maximum seedling height of each species were recorded in each sub-plot.

  methods: successional stage; Fire responses in WSRf described in terms of seedling recruitment and resprouting traits were examined in broad functional-phytogeographical components of the WSRf flora, including primary fire response (OSR, FR, OR), growth-form (herbaceous, woody), preferred habitat (mesophytic/rainforest vs sclerophytic/open forest) and successional niche (early successional vs late successional, on the basis of information on species ecology in PlantNet (Royal Botanic Gardens, Sydney), Harden et al. 2006, 2007 and Floyd 2008). A functional group identifies a group of species that share an aspect of species ecology that usually has some adaptive significance (Miller and Murphy 2017; Kearney et al. 2021). A species assigned to rainforest habitat shows best development in rainforest habitat. It may also be found in sclerophyll habitat, but is generally smaller in number and stature. Early successional species are those that are more prominent in the initial stages of wet sclerophyll-rainforest succession and included some long-lived species. Late successional or mature phase species are those prominent in later stages of this succession. Nearly all sclerophyll species were classed early successional in the context of rainforest succession (see Supplementary data S1).
