  description: These data provide observed and interpolated functional trait values
    for 1220 Tasmanian plant species.
  collection_type: literature
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: We collated functional trait data (maximum height, maximum leaf
    length, maximum leaf width, mean seed mass) for as many of the target 1220 Tasmanian
    plant species as possible. Data on leaf length and width were collated for the
    smallest lamina for compound leaves & ferns, with length and width for all species
    combined to calculate a single 'leaf area' trait, by assuming elliptically shaped
    leaves for every species. Trait data were collated from a variety of published
    and online sources and some limited field collected data. Where trait information
    could not be obtained for recorded species, we estimated species traits by applying
    the mean value across all species in the nearest taxonomic group (i.e. genus,
    family).
  original_file: Tasmanian_plant_trait_data.csv
  notes: The custom R code filters out interpolated values, as identified in the submitted
    data file. The custom R code also filters out values known to be sourced from
    herbarium databases already in AusTraits. In particular, seed mass values that
    are identical to those in Kew_2019_1 are filtered out. Plant height values that
    are identical to those in Barlow_1981, CPBR_2002, GrassBase_2014, RBGSYD_2014,
    SAH_2014, TMAG_2009, and WAH_1998 have been removed. Harden 2000 and Maslin and
    Tame 2001 are not included as secondary references, because AusTraits includes
    references that supercede these.

  methods: We collated functional trait data (maximum height, maximum leaf length,
    maximum leaf width, mean seed mass) for as many of the target 1220 Tasmanian plant
    species as possible. Trait data were collated from a variety of published material
    (Reid et al. 1999, Harden 2000, Jordan 2001, Maslin and Tame 2001, McGlone et
    al. 2010), and field collection by the authors. Where trait information could
    not be obtained for recorded species, we estimated species traits by applying
    the mean value across all species in the nearest taxonomic group (i.e. genus,

  methods: Data on leaf length and width were collated for the smallest lamina for
    compound leaves and ferns, with length and width for all species combined to calculate
    a single 'leaf area' trait, by assuming elliptically shaped leaves for every species.
    Trait data were collated from a variety of published material (Reid et al. 1999,
    Harden 2000, Jordan 2001, Maslin and Tame 2001, McGlone et al. 2010), and field
    collection by the authors. No values for leaf area were a priori filtered during
    data input by AusTraits as there was minimal overlap with species x value combinations
    already in AusTraits. These interpolated values have been filtered out of AusTraits.

    seed mass values that are identical to those in Kew_2019_1 are filtered out. Although
    Jordan_2001 is in AusTraits and a source for this study, there is no overlap,
    because Jordan recorded seed width and length, not actual seed mass.
