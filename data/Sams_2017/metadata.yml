  description: A compiled database to test the hypothesis that regional species pool, system productivity, climate and landscape structure are important drivers of forest reassembly outcomes.
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: "Between 2012 and 2014, we surveyed Australian tropical and subtropical rain forest in six locations, spanning 13 deg of latitude (17-30 deg S, c. 1,500 km; Figure 1). Australian subtropical and tropical rain forests have many plant taxa with shared evolutionary and biogeographical histories (Kooyman, Zanne et al., 2013), and fire is not a typical disturbance in this ecosystem type, even after land clearing (Bowman, 2000). The six study locations differed extensively in annual rainfall, seasonality and daily to annual temperatures, and occurred in locations with limited covariation among these climate variables (correspond to letters in Figure 1; Supporting Information Appendix Table A1; see 'Climate variables' below). To ensure sites were as comparable as possible, however, we held the following characteristics constant: general forest type, disturbance levels and parent soil type. One of the most common substrates to support Australian rain forests are tertiary basalt soils (Adam, 1994). We included only rain forests on basalt substrates because of the relatively consistent geological history of these soils and the rarity with which basalt-based Australian rain forests extend their boundaries to adjacent lower-nutrient soil types. Although soils inevitably varied somewhat among sites, there was also no evidence of systematic variance in the soils in primary and secondary rain forest plots (data not shown). Australia's relatively recent and well-documented land-use history makes it much easier to find patches of regrowing forest of similar ages and history in close proximity to remnants of unlogged forest than in most tropical regions of the world. We selected secondary rain forest sites that were all known to have been cleared 50-60 years before our surveys, minimizing variation in regrowth age. Previous studies have shown that canopy and understorey components of forest communities often exhibit different responses to land-use change (Chazdon, Careaga, Webb, & Vargas, 2003; Mayfield et al., 2013), probably attributable to the distinct environments found in these forest strata (Van Den Berg, Chazdon, & Correa, 2012). We expected trait recovery trajectories of the canopy and understorey to differ, and thus, we collected and analysed data for the canopy and understorey strata of our forests, separately. In each location, we sampled six 20 m x 20 m plots, three in 'primary' rain forest with no history of human land use and three 'secondary' regrowth plots (clear felled 50-60 years before the study) left to regenerate with little or no secondary disturbance (e.g., grazing, burning) before abandonment. Primary and secondary rain forest plots within locations were all within 2 km of each other. Land-use history and age of secondary rain forests were identified using aerial photographs, expert knowledge and historical data. To determine species abundance and diversity in the canopy of each plot, we counted and identified all stems with diameter at breast height (DBH) >=10 cm. For understorey, we counted and identified to species all stems with DBH between 1 and 10 cm in a single 10m 3 10 m subplot nested within each 20 m x 20 m plot. Data from the Border Ranges National Park (Location E in Figure 1) were originally collected for a different study (using the same methods detailed above) and did not include data on understorey plants. This location was thus excluded from understorey analyses. In total, 235 species and 1,806 stems were counted and identified across all six locations (36 total plots)."

  notes: I have compared your data with Kooyman_2011 (also in AusTraits), Cooper_2013 (Cooper & Cooper; also in AusTraits), and Metcalfe_2009 (also in AusTraits). This has led me to filter out most fruit dimension, seed dimension, and plant height values. I've only kept those unique to AusTraits. I will eventually also compare the wood density values to those in Zanne_2009 and remove duplicates.

  value_type: expert_mean
  replicates: .na
  methods: Only 24 records overlap with Kooyman_2011 (species and value), so no filtering done for this variable. Species mean wood density values for tropical tree species were obtained from a database curated by DJ Metcalfe and consisted of measured densities for 168 species from CSIROs permanent rainforest plots (Bradford et al., 2014) and estimated densities for nine species. Measured densities were compiled from field sampling (density determined after Heinrichs & Lassen, 1970), or conversion of air-dry data from Cause et al. (1989), Hyland (1983), or Hyland (1989). Estimated densities for nine further species were given as mean values of congeners or confamilials in existing CSIRO wood density databases. Wood density species mean estimates for adults of subtropical species were obtained from RM Kooyman's database consisting of values extracted from published sources, and where necessary converted from dry weight (kg m3) to basic density (Chave et al., 2009). Further description can be found in Kooyman et al. (2013).
