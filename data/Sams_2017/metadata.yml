  description: A compiled database to test the hypothesis that regional species pool,
    system productivity, climate and landscape structure are important drivers of
    forest reassembly outcomes.

  sampling_strategy: 'Between 2012 and 2014, we surveyed Australian tropical and subtropical
    rain forest in six locations, spanning 13 deg of latitude (17-30 deg S, c. 1,500
    km; Figure 1). Australian subtropical and tropical rain forests have many plant
    taxa with shared evolutionary and biogeographical histories (Kooyman, Zanne et
    al., 2013), and fire is not a typical disturbance in this ecosystem type, even
    after land clearing (Bowman, 2000). The six study locations differed extensively
    in annual rainfall, seasonality and daily to annual temperatures, and occurred
    in locations with limited covariation among these climate variables (correspond
    to letters in Figure 1; Supporting Information Appendix Table A1; see ''Climate
    variables'' below). To ensure sites were as comparable as possible, however, we
    held the following characteristics constant: general forest type, disturbance
    levels and parent soil type. One of the most common substrates to support Australian
    rain forests are tertiary basalt soils (Adam, 1994). We included only rain forests
    on basalt substrates because of the relatively consistent geological history of
    these soils and the rarity with which basalt-based Australian rain forests extend
    their boundaries to adjacent lower-nutrient soil types. Although soils inevitably
    varied somewhat among sites, there was also no evidence of systematic variance
    in the soils in primary and secondary rain forest plots (data not shown). Australia''s
    relatively recent and well-documented land-use history makes it much easier to
    find patches of regrowing forest of similar ages and history in close proximity
    to remnants of unlogged forest than in most tropical regions of the world. We
    selected secondary rain forest sites that were all known to have been cleared
    50-60 years before our surveys, minimizing variation in regrowth age. Previous
    studies have shown that canopy and understorey components of forest communities
    often exhibit different responses to land-use change (Chazdon, Careaga, Webb,
    & Vargas, 2003; Mayfield et al., 2013), probably attributable to the distinct
    environments found in these forest strata (Van Den Berg, Chazdon, & Correa, 2012).
    We expected trait recovery trajectories of the canopy and understorey to differ,
    and thus, we collected and analysed data for the canopy and understorey strata
    of our forests, separately. In each location, we sampled six 20 m x 20 m plots,
    three in ''primary'' rain forest with no history of human land use and three ''secondary''
    regrowth plots (clear felled 50-60 years before the study) left to regenerate
    with little or no secondary disturbance (e.g., grazing, burning) before abandonment.
    Primary and secondary rain forest plots within locations were all within 2 km
    of each other. Land-use history and age of secondary rain forests were identified
    using aerial photographs, expert knowledge and historical data. To determine species
    abundance and diversity in the canopy of each plot, we counted and identified
    all stems with diameter at breast height (DBH) >=10 cm. For understorey, we counted
    and identified to species all stems with DBH between 1 and 10 cm in a single 10m
    3 10 m subplot nested within each 20 m x 20 m plot. Data from the Border Ranges
    National Park (Location E in Figure 1) were originally collected for a different
    study (using the same methods detailed above) and did not include data on understorey
    plants. This location was thus excluded from understorey analyses. In total, 235
    species and 1,806 stems were counted and identified across all six locations (36
    total plots).'

  notes: I have compared your data with Kooyman_2011 (also in AusTraits), Cooper_2013
    (Cooper & Cooper; also in AusTraits), and Metcalfe_2009 (also in AusTraits). This
    has led me to filter out most fruit dimension, seed dimension, and plant height
    values. I've only kept those unique to AusTraits. I will eventually also compare
    the wood density values to those in Zanne_2009 and remove duplicates. This data
    set includes vegetation surveys across mulitple quadats at each of the listed
    sites. This data remains in the raw data files, but is not in AusTraits. Because
    trait values are a single species mean. Most of these values are linked to a specific
    site, however 19 species' values are multi-site means with leaves collected at
    2-3 locations. For these, in most cases leaves were sampled at two close by locations
    (Quinkin and Wooroonoran NP the most common pair, followed by Dorrigo NP and Bunya
    NP); for these pairs, the lat/lon coordinates for Quinkin and Bunya NP were always
    assigned to the value. For samples collected across three sites, the lat/lon for
    the "middle" site (by location) was chosen. For the few samples collected across
    two disparate sites, one site's lat/lon were arbitrarily chosen. The actual collection
    sites for all species are recorded in the data.csv file.

    methods: Species mean wood (stem) density values for tropical tree species were
    obtained from a database curated by DJ Metcalfe and consisted of measured densities
    for 168 species from CSIROs permanent rainforest plots (Bradford et al., 2014)
    and estimated densities for nine species. Measured densities were compiled from
    field sampling (density determined after Heinrichs & Lassen, 1970), or conversion
    of air-dry data from Cause et al. (1989), Hyland (1983), or Hyland (1989). Estimated
    densities for nine further species were given as mean values of congeners or confamilials
    in existing CSIRO wood density databases. Wood density species mean estimates
    for adults of subtropical species were obtained from RM Kooyman''s database consisting
    of values extracted from published sources, and where necessary converted from
    dry weight (kg m3) to basic density (Chave et al., 2009). Further description
    can be found in Kooyman et al. (2013).'
