  description: The study generated a dated phylogeny for the iconic Australian genus
    Banksia, and reconstructed the evolutionary/chronological position of five putatively
    fire-related traits.
  basis_of_record: literature field
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: Five traits, and their opposing states (which we also term traits,
    consistent with the tradition in ecology), that appear to give a selective advantage
    in the presence of fire were investigated, resprouting (fire-tolerant/avoiding),
    clonality (fire-avoiding), serotiny (fire-dependent), and retention of dead florets
    and retention of dead leaves (fire-enhancing). Traits for all Banksia taxa, five
    Dryandra species and the outgroup were collated from the literature (Taylor &
    Hopper, 1988; George, 1996; Collins et al., 2008; Western Australian Herbarium,
    2009) and our own fieldwork (dead leaf retention has not been recognized previously).
    Study species were first categorized according to their whole-plant response to
    fire, that is, resprouting or its opposing state, fire-killed. Clonality may be
    viewed as the ultimate whole-plant adaptation to fire [most vulnerable to being
    burnt (ground-hugging), best protected budbank (soil), least seed production,
    survives the most fire-cycles]. Consequently, growth form was partitioned into
    clonal (vegetative reproduction via rhizomes or root suckers after fire, minimal
    seed production) and nonclonal (no vegetative reproduction, recovery via epicormic
    and/or lignotuberous buds and/or seeds after fire) taxa.

  methods: Taxa were classified as either retaining at least some of their seeds in
    the cones for several years or more (serotinous; Lamont et al., 1991) or releasing
    all of their seeds at maturity (nonserotinous). Traits for all Banksia taxa, five
    Dryandra species and the outgroup were collated from the literature (Taylor &
    Hopper, 1988; George, 1996; Collins et al., 2008; Western Australian Herbarium,

  methods: Taxa were grouped into those that retained at least some of their dead
    florets around the mature fruits, those whose mantle of dead florets was so thick
    and dense that the fruits were concealed (the involucral bracts serve this purpose
    in Dryandra), and those that shed their spent florets immediately. Traits for
    all Banksia taxa, five Dryandra species and the outgroup were collated from the
    literature (Taylor & Hopper, 1988; George, 1996; Collins et al., 2008; Western
    Australian Herbarium, 2009) and our own fieldwork (dead leaf retention has not

  methods: Species were separated into those that retained at least some of their
