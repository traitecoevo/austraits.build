  description: Study investigating the fire-response traits of woody understorey and
    sub-canopy species in montane wet sclerophyll forest after high and low intensity
    fires.
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: adult, seedling (by trait)
  sampling_strategy: The area selected for study at Washpool National Park (hereafter
    WPNP) was in the recent western additions that were acquired by the New South
    Wales National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) in 1998 and had not been burnt
    for at least 50 years. The fires that occurred in November 2002 were high-intensity
    fires that burnt all vegetation strata in the sclerophyll forests and the understorey
    of the warm temperate rainforest. Mummel Gulf National Park (hereafter MGNP) lies
    approximately 60 km east of Walcha and was also gazetted as National Park in the
    late 1990s. The fire at MGNP was a back-burn, initiated by the NPWS to contain
    a grass fire from a neighbouring property in October of 2001. The fire was of
    low to moderate intensity and resulted in the complete burning of the understorey
    and ground layer, but with minimal canopy scorching. All study sites occurred
    at altitudes greater than 900 m on metasediment-derived soils. Prior to the fires,
    areas of wet sclerophyll forests within each park were surveyed for full floristic
    composition using 20 x 20 m quadrats (21 vegetation survey sites in total- WPNP,
    12 sites; MGNP, 9 sites). Vegetation in each quadrat was described in terms of
    the growth form, height and cover of dominant species in the ground storey, understorey
    and canopy strata. All species were recorded in each quadrat and their abundance
    estimated using Braun-Blanquet cover-abundance scale. For each survey quadrat
    geographical position, altitude, slope, local soil characteristics, physiography,
    evidence of fire and other disturbances were recorded. Responses of woody plant
    species to fire were recorded at four sites within burnt forest at WPNP and MGNP.
    At each of these sites two transects (20 x 2 m) were placed along each of three
    topographical positions - ridge, slope and gully. Topographical position accounted
    for differences in vegetation composition prior to fire and differences in fire
    intensity. Post-fire responses of adult plants were recorded along each transect
    in four categories- 1) killed by fire, 2) resprouting via root suckers, 3) resprouting
    via basal stem buds, and 4) resprouting via stem buds. The presence of post-fire
    seedling recruits was also recorded. In addition to these observations, post-fire
    responses of other woody species outside of transects (16 species) were recorded
    to gain a more comprehensive overview of fire-response traits of wet sclerophyll
    forest understorey species.

    Life history data (including growth form) were constructed using observations

  methods: To test for differences in persistence syndromes between rainforest and
    sclerophyll forest taxa growing in the same habitat, species were divided into
    three foliage types; sclerophyllous, coriaceous and mesophyllous. These categories
    were chosen as preliminary representatives of the different life-history syndromes
    of plant species in the wet sclerophyll ecotone. Rainforest taxa generally fell
    into the mesophyllous and coriaceous leaf types, while most sclerophyll forest
    taxa were classified as sclerophyllous.

    were placed along each of three topographical positions - ridge, slope and gully.
    Topographical position accounted for differences in vegetation composition prior
    to fire and differences in fire intensity. Post-fire responses of adult plants
    were recorded along each transect in four categories- 1) killed by fire, 2) resprouting
    via root suckers, 3) resprouting via basal stem buds, and 4) resprouting via stem
    buds. The presence of post-fire seedling recruits was also recorded. In addition
    to these observations, post-fire responses of other woody species outside of transects
    (16 species) were recorded to gain a more comprehensive overview of fire-response
    traits of wet sclerophyll forest understorey species. Plant species were allocated
    to one of five fire response syndromes based on categories defined by Gill and
    Bradstock (1992). Note that because of the low frequency of occurrence, species
    killed by fire were classified into one group regardless of seed bank type. An
    additional group was also formed with the combination of regeneration by root
    suckering (Category IV) and resprouting by basal stem buds (Category V).
