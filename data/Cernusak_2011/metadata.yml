  description: Leaf-level photosynthetic parameters of species in the closely related
    genera Eucalyptus and Corymbia were assessed along a strong rainfall gradient
    in northern Australia.
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: Leaf gas exchange measurements were made at six sites along a
    sub-continental rainfall gradient in northern Australia (Fig. 1). The sites covered
    a latitudinal range from approximately 12 deg S to 23 deg S, with corresponding
    MAP ranging from approximately 1700 mm to 300 mm (Table 1). Two canopy tree species
    characteristic of each site were selected for measurements. All of the selected
    species were from the genus Eucalyptus, or the closely related genus Corymbia
    (Table 1). Two individuals of each of the two species at each site were selected
    for measurements. A total of six leaves were sampled from each species at each
    site. Canopy access was achieved with a 16 m elevated work platform at the four
    more northerly sites, and with ladders or from the ground at the two more southerly
    sites where trees were shorter.

    Leaf gas exchange.xls (full light response and A-Ci curve data) in raw data folder
    and GoogleDrive folder
  notes: The few duplicate values within this dataset, and with Schmidt_2003, Schulze_1998,
    and Schulze_2006_2 seem to all be random, independent values since many measurements
    for the same traits were made on the same species.

  methods: 'Values used are from the first step of the A-ci curve, where CO2 was approximately
    400 ppm and PAR 1200 umol m-2 s-1. In detail, two portable photosynthesis systems
    (Li-6400, LiCor Inc., Lincoln, NE, USA) were used to measure the response of photosynthesis
    to intercellular CO2 concentration (A-ci curve) and to light (light response curve).
    The two systems were cross calibrated, and gave unbiased results with respect
    to each other. The measurement sequence for each sampled leaf started with the
    A-ci curve and then proceeded to the light response curve. The CO2 concentration
    (umol mol-1) entering the leaf gas exchange cuvette was altered in the following
    sequence: 400, 280, 230, 150, 70, 40, 230, 400, 640, 980, and 1200. A measurement
    of photosynthesis was logged approximately 2 min after each step change in CO2
    concentration entering the cuvette. Irradiance during the A-ci curve measurements
    was set at 2000 umol photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) m-2 s-1, supplied
    by an artificial light source (6400-02B LED, LiCor Inc.). At the conclusion of
    the A-ci curve, the light response curve was measured on the same leaf. The CO2
    concentration of air entering the cuvette was maintained at 1200 umol mol-1, and
    irradiance (umol PAR m-2 s-1) was altered in the following sequence: 2000, 1500,
    1000, 500, 200, 120, 70, 40, 20, and 0. A measurement of photosynthesis was logged
    approximately 2 min after each step change in irradiance. We endeavoured to maintain
    the leaf-to-air vapour pressure difference (D) and the leaf temperature (T) constant
    across sites and within a site for each sample leaf during A-ci and light response
    measurements. The target D was 2.5 kPa and the target T was 33 deg C. Mean site
    values (mean +/- 1 SD) for T during measurements ranged from 32.3 +/- 0.6  deg
    C at the Howard Springs site to 33.9 +/- 2.0  deg C at the Boulia site. Mean site
    values during measurements for D ranged from 2.1 +/- 0.2 kPa at the Howard Springs
    site to 3.1 +/- 0.7 kPa at the Boulia site. Measurements at all sites except the
    Boulia site took place between 2 and 15 September 2008. Measurements at the Boulia
    site took place between 5 and 8 December 2008. Precipitation at the Boulia site
    does not show as highly pronounced a seasonal variation as the more northerly
    sites. A cumulative precipitation of 56 mm was recorded at the Boulia Airport
    in the nine months preceding the measurement campaign (http://www.bom.gov.au/index.shtml).
    Gas exchange measurements were taken between 0800 h and 1700 h local time at each
