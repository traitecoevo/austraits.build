  description: Study investigating patterns of multiple leaf-scale traits, including
    foliar 13C isotope discrimination (D13C), rates of photosynthesis and foliar N
    concentration across eight sites spanning contrasting biomes, to understand shifts
    in functional trait values with climate.
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: The study accessed eight nodes of the Australian SuperSite Network
    across the continent. This Network (http://www.tern-supersites.net.au/) is a part
    of the Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Network (TERN), a federally funded initiative
    of the Australian government. Each SuperSite is a distinctly different type of
    ecosystem. Multiple data streams collected from these SuperSites provide a novel
    opportunity to combine and compare contrasting ecosystems across continental Australia.
    ^p Each site is comprised of a one hectare plot within the footprint of the eddy
    covariance flux tower located at each SuperSite. Within each hectare, replicated
    measurements were made on dominant and mostly broadleaf evergreen overstorey species
    that collectively accounted for ca 80% of the (aboveground) biomass of each site.
    Across all sites, a total of 55 plant species were sampled in the dryseason and
    44 species sampled in the wet-season (417 individual trees from 27 plant families).
    Identical measurements were made of foliar d13C on four to six selected individuals
    of each species, from which D13C was calculated. Variation in 16 additional leaf
    attributes (gas-exchange characteristics, structural and nutrient traits, see
    Table 2 for details) across the SuperSites and their relationships with D13C were
    also examined. ^p Leaf gas-exchange and additional leaf traits (Table 2) were
    measured on 407 individual plants across 80 species at each of the seven Supersites
    (Table 1), generally across winter and summer seasons or wet- and dry-seasons.
    Leaf gas-exchange was measured in the morning using a portable photosynthesis
    system (Li-Cor 6400; Li-Cor, Nebraska, USA) on upper canopy, fully expanded leaves
    on detached branches. Where there was evidence of an impact of detachment on gas
    exchange, replacement branches were sampled. ^p Mature, healthy, upper canopy,
    sunlit leaves were collected in the wet/dry or summer/winter seasons for analysis
    of d13C isotope composition.

  notes: The analyses for this study include many additional traits. Most of this
    data is in Bloomfield_2018. The only data analyses in this study, but not available
    is from Litchfield Savanna. Although we haven't made contact with the author,
    Owen Atkin and Keith Bloomfield confirmed the source of the other data and suggested
    Derek Eamus would have the additional data from Litchfield Savanna.
locations:
  Alice Mulga:
    site code: AMU
    longitude (deg): 133.2493
    latitude (deg): -22.2828
    precipitation, MAP (mm): 321.0
    temperature, MA (C): 22.4
    description: semi-arid tropical savanna
    notes: The semi-arid Alice Mulga SuperSite is located approximately 200 km north
      of Alice Springs, in the Northern Territory of Australia. The climate is characterized
      as having hot summers and warm winters. Mean annual rainfall is ~300 mm and
      is highly seasonal, mostly occurring in large rainfall events during summer.
      Vegetation is dominated by Mulga (Acacia aneura and related species) woodlands,
      occasionally with large areas of spinifex under sparse woodland of Corymbia
      and other Acacia species (Cleverly et al., 2016).
  Calperum Mallee:
    site code: CM
    longitude (deg): 140.6738
    latitude (deg): -34.0373
    precipitation, MAP (mm): 255.0
    temperature, MA (C): 17.3
    description: semi-arid woodland
    notes: The Calperum Mallee SuperSite is in the mallee semi-arid ecosystem located
      approximately 25 km north of Renmark in South Australia. The landscape is an
      extensive plain with undulating mallee woodland and riverine vegetation that
      fringes the River Murray and its anabranches. The vegetation is dominated by
      upper storey Eucalypt trees of four species (Eucalyptus dumosa, Eucalyptus incrassata,
      Eucalyptus oleosa and Eucalyptus socialis) (Meyer et al., 2015).
  Cumberland Plain:
    site code: CP
    longitude (deg): 150.7382
    latitude (deg): -33.619
    precipitation, MAP (mm): 900.0
    temperature, MA (C): 17.7
    description: temperate woodland
    notes: The Cumberland Plain is a sclerophyll Eucalyptus woodland west of Richmond
      in New South Wales. The soil is characterized by nutrient-poor alluvium from
      sandstone and shale bedrock in the Blue Mountains deposited by the Nepean River.
      Despite being nutrient poor, this SuperSite supports high regional biodiversity
      and endemic biota and is dominated by Eucalyptus fibrosa, E. moluccana and E.
      tereticornis in the overstorey. Mean annual precipitation of this site is 900
      mm (Table 1).
  FNQ Rainforest near Cape Tribulation:
    site code: CT
    longitude (deg): 145.45
    latitude (deg): -16.1
    precipitation, MAP (mm): 5700.0
    temperature, MA (C): 25.2
    description: lowland wet tropical rainforest
    notes: The FNQ Rainforest SuperSite is located in a tropical wet forest ~140 km
      north of Cairns in Far North Queensland. This SuperSite is structurally divided
      into two transects - a) the lowland rainforest based in the Daintree rainforest
      near Cape Tribulation (MAT = 25.2 °C, Ozflux site average MAP = 5700 mm) and
      b) the upland rainforest based around Robson Creek (MAT = 21 °C, MAP = 2140
      mm). Precipitation is highly seasonal with most occurring during summer (Weerasinghe
      et al., 2014). FNQ supports 10% of Australian flora despite of occurring in
      only 0.2% its landmass. Consequently a substantial number of the species in
      this study comes from this SuperSite. Data from two nodes of this SuperSite,
      i.e., Cape Tribulation and Robson Creek were collected and analysed independently
      in this study because of significantly different environmental clines (altitude,
      MAT and MAP) that exists in these two nodes of FNQ.
  Great Western Woodlands:
    site code: GWW
    longitude (deg): 120.6917
    latitude (deg): -30.264
    precipitation, MAP (mm): 273.0
    temperature, MA (C): 18.5
    description: temperate woodland
    notes: The Great Western Woodlands located in south-west Western Australia is
      the largest remaining intact semi-arid temperate woodland in the world. The
      vegetation comprises a 16-million hectare mosaic of mallee, scrub-heath and
      woodland and is locally determined by edaphic factors and influenced by historic
      disturbances (Gosper et al., 2013). Mean annual rainfall is ~250 mm with the
      highest-mean rainfall months in winter. Eucalyptus salubris constructs the dominant
      crown layer in association with other Eucalyptus species (E. salmonophloia,
      E. longicornis and E. moderata) (Gosper et al., 2013).
  Litchfield Savanna:
    site code: LF
    longitude (deg): 131.1461
    latitude (deg): -12.4853
    precipitation, MAP (mm): 1714.0
    temperature, MA (C): 27.8
    description: high rainfall tropical savanna
    notes: The Litchfield Savanna SuperSite is a ~1.5 km2 tropical savanna 70 km south
      of Darwin in northern Australia. This site is representative of the dominant
      ecosystem of that region. Climate of this site is typical of northern Australia
      with extremely seasonal and high rainfall and approximately 56% of this site
      is burnt annually (Murphy et al., 2010). However, in this study, data collected
      from Howard Springs (approximately 65 km north of Litchfield SuperSite; (Cernusak
      et al., 2011) have been used as a representative of this particular SuperSite.
      This approach is justified because both of these sites had very similar vegetation
      and climate conditions as well as frequency of occurrence of fire. The stand
      structure in these two sites are sufficiently similar as to not shift physiological
      properties at the leaf-scale given the species occurred in both sites largely
      overlap (Bowman et al., 2001; Hutley and Beringer, 2010; Murphy et al., 2010).
  FNQ Rainforest around Robson Creek:
    site code: RC
    longitude (deg): 145.6323
    latitude (deg): -17.1195
    precipitation, MAP (mm): 2140.0
    temperature, MA (C): 21.0
    description: upland wet tropical rainforest
    notes: The FNQ Rainforest SuperSite is located in a tropical wet forest ~140 km
      north of Cairns in Far North Queensland. This SuperSite is structurally divided
      into two transects - a) the lowland rainforest based in the Daintree rainforest
      near Cape Tribulation (MAT = 25.2 °C, Ozflux site average MAP = 5700 mm) and
      b) the upland rainforest based around Robson Creek (MAT = 21 °C, MAP = 2140
      mm). Precipitation is highly seasonal with most occurring during summer (Weerasinghe
      et al., 2014). FNQ supports 10% of Australian flora despite of occurring in
      only 0.2% its landmass. Consequently a substantial number of the species in
      this study comes from this SuperSite. Data from two nodes of this SuperSite,
      i.e., Cape Tribulation and Robson Creek were collected and analysed independently
      in this study because of significantly different environmental clines (altitude,
      MAT and MAP) that exists in these two nodes of FNQ.
  Warra Tall Eucalypt:
    site code: WR
    longitude (deg): 146.6512
    latitude (deg): -43.0888
    precipitation, MAP (mm): 1474.0
    temperature, MA (C): 10.1
    description: temperate wet forest
    notes: The Warra Tall Eucalypt SuperSite is a cool, wet temperate forest located
      in Tasmania. Vegetation is dominated by tall Eucalyptus obliqua occurring in
      a full range of successional stages from young regrowth forests to old-growth
      mixed forests (Hickey et al., 1999). Mean annual temperature at this site is
      the lowest (~10°C), with a mean annual precipitation of 1474 mm (Table 1).

  methods: Identical measurements were made of foliar d13C on four to six selected
    individuals of each species, from which D13C was calculated. Mature, healthy,
    upper canopy, sunlit leaves were collected in the wet/dry or summer/winter seasons
    and dried in an oven at 60°C for 5 days. After drying, each leaf sample was ground
    with a Retsch MM300 bead grinding mill (Verder Group, Netherlands) until finely
    and homogeneously ground. Between one and two milligrams of ground material was
    sub-sampled in 3.5 mm x 5 mm tin capsules for analysis of d13C giving three representative
    independent values per tree. All d13C analyses were performed using a Picarro
    G2121-i Analyser (Picarro, Santa Clara, CA, USA) for isotopic CO2 in the UTS TERG
    research laboratory. Atropine and Acetanilide were used as laboratory standard
    references and results were normalized with the international standards Sucrose
    (IAEA-CH-6, d13CVPDB = -10.45ppth), Cellulose (IAEA-CH-3, d13CVPDB = -24.72ppth)
    and Graphite (USGS24, d13CVPDB = -16.05ppth). d13C across all samples ranged from
    ca -25ppth to ca -37ppth with a measurement error (standard deviation) of 0.5ppth.
    Species-mean values (obtained from leaves sampled from four to six individuals)
    for the dominant overstorey species for each SuperSite were calculated for each
    trait to account for intraspecific variability. Discrimination was calculated
    from the isotopic ratio of 13C to 12C in leaves as per Farquhar and Richards (1984).
    Leaf intrinsic water-use efficiency (WUEi) was calculated using the species mean
    D13C based on a leaf-scale model of C3 photosynthetic isotope discrimination (Farquhar
    et al., 1989) (see manuscript for formula).
