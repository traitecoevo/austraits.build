CM,Calperum Mallee,"The Calperum Mallee SuperSite is in the mallee semi-arid ecosystem located approximately 25 km north of Renmark in South Australia. The landscape is an extensive plain with undulating mallee woodland and riverine vegetation that fringes the River Murray and its anabranches. The vegetation is dominated by upper storey Eucalypt trees of four species (Eucalyptus dumosa, Eucalyptus incrassata, Eucalyptus oleosa and Eucalyptus socialis) (Meyer et al., 2015). ",140.6738,-34.0373,255,17.3,semi-arid woodland
GWW,Great Western Woodlands,"The Great Western Woodlands located in south-west Western Australia is the largest remaining intact semi-arid temperate woodland in the world. The vegetation comprises a 16-million hectare mosaic of mallee, scrub–heath and woodland and is locally determined by edaphic factors and influenced by historic disturbances (Gosper et al., 2013). Mean annual rainfall is ~250 mm with the highest-mean rainfall months in winter. Eucalyptus salubris constructs the dominant crown layer in association with other Eucalyptus species (E. salmonophloia, E. longicornis and E. moderata) (Gosper et al., 2013).",120.6917,-30.264,273,18.5,temperate woodland
AMU,Alice Mulga,"The semi-arid Alice Mulga SuperSite is located approximately 200 km north of Alice Springs, in the Northern Territory of Australia. The climate is characterized as having hot summers and warm winters. Mean annual rainfall is ~300 mm and is highly seasonal, mostly occurring in large rainfall events during summer. Vegetation is dominated by Mulga (Acacia aneura and related species) woodlands, occasionally with large areas of spinifex under sparse woodland of Corymbia and other Acacia species (Cleverly et al., 2016). ",133.2493,-22.2828,321,22.4,semi-arid tropical savanna
CP,Cumberland Plain,"The Cumberland Plain is a sclerophyll Eucalyptus woodland west of Richmond in New South Wales. The soil is characterized by nutrient-poor alluvium from sandstone and shale bedrock in the Blue Mountains deposited by the Nepean River. Despite being nutrient poor, this SuperSite supports high regional biodiversity and endemic biota and is dominated by Eucalyptus fibrosa, E. moluccana and E. tereticornis in the overstorey. Mean annual precipitation of this site is 900 mm (Table 1).",150.7382,-33.619,900,17.7,temperate woodland
WR,Warra Tall Eucalypt,"The Warra Tall Eucalypt SuperSite is a cool, wet temperate forest located in Tasmania. Vegetation is dominated by tall Eucalyptus obliqua occurring in a full range of successional stages from young regrowth forests to old-growth mixed forests (Hickey et al., 1999). Mean annual temperature at this site is the lowest (~10°C), with a mean annual precipitation of 1474 mm (Table 1).",146.6512,-43.0888,1474,10.1,temperate wet forest
LF,Litchfield Savanna,"The Litchfield Savanna SuperSite is a ~1.5 km2 tropical savanna 70 km south of Darwin in northern Australia. This site is representative of the dominant ecosystem of that region. Climate of this site is typical of northern Australia with extremely seasonal and high rainfall and approximately 56% of this site is burnt annually (Murphy et al., 2010). However, in this study, data collected from Howard Springs (approximately 65 km north of Litchfield SuperSite; (Cernusak et al., 2011) have been used as a representative of this particular SuperSite. This approach is justified because both of these sites had very similar vegetation and climate conditions as well as frequency of occurrence of fire. The stand structure in these two sites are sufficiently similar as to not shift physiological properties at the leaf-scale given the species occurred in both sites largely overlap (Bowman et al., 2001; Hutley and Beringer, 2010; Murphy et al., 2010).

RC,FNQ Rainforest around Robson Creek,"The FNQ Rainforest SuperSite is located in a tropical wet forest ~140 km north of Cairns in Far North Queensland. This SuperSite is structurally divided into two transects – a) the lowland rainforest based in the Daintree rainforest near Cape Tribulation (MAT = 25.2 °C, Ozflux site average MAP = 5700 mm) and b) the upland rainforest based around Robson Creek (MAT = 21 °C, MAP = 2140 mm). Precipitation is highly seasonal with most occurring during summer (Weerasinghe et al., 2014). FNQ supports 10% of Australian flora despite of occurring in only 0.2% its landmass. Consequently a substantial number of the species in this study comes from this SuperSite. Data from two nodes of this SuperSite, i.e., Cape Tribulation and Robson Creek were collected and analysed independently in this study because of significantly different environmental clines (altitude, MAT and MAP) that exists in these two nodes of FNQ.",145.6323,-17.1195,2140,21,upland wet tropical rainforest
