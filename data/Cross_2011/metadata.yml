questions:
  contributors: Could you please provide both a site description (lat/long,
    any other physical data available or a brief description), sampling strategy,
    and basic methods used to measure your traits.
  question2: For six species, the seed weight is listed as 0 - does this indicate that seed weight it missing or is this a problem with significant figures having been rounded to zero at some point? I've currently made the assumption they are missing weights.
  question3: Is plant height the maximum species height at the site or simply the height of the individual measured? We are only considered "maximum height" to be a trait. "Plant height" is considered an allometric property and excluded.
  question4: Should John Morgan be included as a contributor, lab_leader, etc. on this study?
