questions:
  contributor: Could you please provide both a site description (lat/long,
    any other physical data available or a brief description), sampling strategy,
    and basic methods used to measure your traits. For six species, the seed weight is listed as 0 - does this indicate that seed weight it missing or is this a problem with significant figures having been rounded to zero at some point? In the data file the following traits are listed as headers, but have NA for all entries -- seed dispersal, growth form, LDMC (by weight and %) and leaf area. Do data exist for these traits?
