  description: The presence of ericoid endophytes was confirmed in hair roots of 14
    species of Epacridaceae native to the Mediterranean south-west of Western Australia.
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: Fourteen species of Epacridaceae were excavated monthly with
    an intact sod of soil between April and December from natural sites in south-west
    Western Australia (Table 1). At each harvest, 10-15 plants were sampled, their
    roots systems bulked and assessment made on the bulked sample.

  methods: Using a modification of a technique for observation of vesicular-arbuscular
    mycorrhiza in roots (M. Scheltema, personal communication), washed segments of
    the root system of Epacridaceae were stained in lactic-glycerol blue (lactic acid
    325 ml, glycerol 300 ml, water 400 ml and 0-65 g of trypan blue powder) overnight
    at 24 Â°C. The following day segments were transferred to lactic-glycerol (lactic
    acid 100 ml, glycerol 200 ml and water 100 ml) for destaining and storage. Infection
    was determined using a x60 dissecting microscope.
