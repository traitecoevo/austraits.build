  description: Functional adaptations of urban trees along a climatic gradient.
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: Sample collection and laboratory analyses were conducted at the
    end of the austral autumn in May and June 2019, respectively. This sampling time
    was during a severe, multi-year drought in eastern Australia, when rainfall was
    in the lowest 10% of historical records. Five trees of each species were measured
    at each of the four sites over three consecutive days. All traits were measured
    for individual trees using mature, fully-expanded canopy leaves. One healthy branch
    per tree (30-cm long) was sampled from the north side of the mid canopy of each
    tree and cut from the main bole. Excised samples were immediately placed on ice
    in an insulated foam box. Sites were selected based on (1) their availability
    of tree inventories with georeferenced data and (2) their location across a climatic
    (temperature and precipitation) gradient from the coast (cool and wet) to inland
    (warm and dry) in the west of the Greater Sydney region. Species were selected
    based on the following criteria- (1) mature, established trees (>five years after
    planting to ensure that trees were well established and subjected to local conditions
    and not under management actions [i.e. not watered, not mulched] according to
    councils' information); (2) species with >five records (i.e. individual trees)
    within each council to ensure adequate replication for sampling; and (3) contrasting
    native distributions based on mapped species geographic origins.

  unit_in: MPa
  trait_name: osmotic_potential
  value_type: raw_value
  replicates: 1
  methods: Turgor loss point and osmotic potential were measured as described by Bartlett

  methods: Individual leaf laminae were measured without petiole or rachis by scanning
    each leaf and using the software ImageJ (Version 1.52k).
- var_in: LDM (g)
  unit_in: g
  trait_name: leaf_dry_mass
  value_type: raw_value
  replicates: 1
  methods: Leaves were freeze-dried for 72 hours (h) and weighed to determine their
    dry mass

  unit_in: m2/kg
  trait_name: specific_leaf_area
  value_type: raw_value
  replicates: 1
