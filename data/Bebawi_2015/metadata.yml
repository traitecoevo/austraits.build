  sampling_strategy: Site description The experimental site (38m x 36 m) was located in the grounds of the Tropical Weeds Research Centre, Charters Towers, north Queensland (208090S, 1468260E; elevation 318 m). It was large enough for the longevity of up to 12 different seed lots of various weed species to be tested at any one time under the same treatment conditions. ^p The site was fenced to exclude livestock, rabbits and kangaroos. It had been previously cleared of woody vegetation and had a ground cover that comprised buffel grass [Cenchrus ciliaris L.], Indian couch [Bothrichloa pertusa (L.) A.Camus]; dark wiregrass (Aristida calycina R.Br.), purpletop chloris (Chloris inflata Link), Red Natal grass [Melinis repens (Willd.) Zizka], feathertop rhodes grass (Chloris virgata Sw.), sabi grass [Urochloa mosambicensis (Hack.) Dandy], budda pea (Aeschynomene indica L.) and siratro [Macroptilium atropurpureum (DC.) Urb.].  ^p Long-term mean annual rainfall for Charters Towers is 658mm with 76% of this occurring during the summer months (December-February) (BOM 2012). The mean maximum daily temperature ranges in summer between 32.68C and 34.88C and in winter (June-August) between 24.88C and 26.68C. Specific details on rainfall and ambient temperature at the field site during the study were measured using an on-site automatic weather station (Campbell Scientific, Logan, UT, USA).  ^p Seed collection  ^p An initial collection of ripe follicles of C. procera was undertaken in December 2008 from two locations, 43 km south-east (208130S, 1468380E) and 15 km north-west of Charters Towers (198590S, 1468300E). Follicles were placed in jackets of aluminium mosquito gauze (1m2) to dry for 2 weeks in a dry glasshouse before seeds were extracted and pooled. Six-hundred and forty subsamples of 50 seeds were then randomly selected and placed in bags of shade cloth (4 cm x 4 cm x 0.5 cm; 1.1mm x 2.4mm mesh size) to simplify seed retrieval while maximising soil/seed contact.  ^p A second seed collection of ripe follicles was undertaken in October 2011 from an infestation of C. procera located in the Gulf of Carpentaria Region (188130S, 1408380E), 820 kmnorth-west of Charters Towers. The same procedure as that used for the initial seed collection was followed for selection and containment of seed lots.  ^p Experimental design  ^p A factorial combination of 2 soil types x 2 pasture levels x 9 retrieval times x 4 seed burial depths was implemented in four blocks in a multiple split-plot design as described in the following paragraphs.  ^p The main plot treatments were established in March 2008 by digging eight trenches (1.0m wide x 0.5m deep x 36m long) 2m apart. The soil/landform into which the trenches were dug was heavy clay loam. The trenches were then grouped into four blocks, each comprising two neighbouring trenches. In each block, one trench was randomly filled with river loam and the other with clay soil that had been collected in the vicinity of Charters Towers. These soils arecommonsoil types in the vicinity of Charters Towers on which C. procera can occur.  ^p To establish the subplots, half of each trench (i.e. 18 m) was randomly allocated to be kept bare (i.e. pasture excluded) through physical removal of all vegetation whereas the other half was allowed to revegetate from the local seed bank and encroachment from the 2-m buffer strips. After 6 months (September 2008), the revegetated portions (i.e. pasture present) had a dense cover of pasture that was ~40-50 cm high.  ^p The pasture present and pasture excluded portions of each trench were divided into 12 1-m-long by 1-m-wide sections with a 50-cm buffer in between, to enable longevity testing of up to 12 seed lots of various weed species at any one time. For both the first and second seed lots of C. procera, subplots were implemented by first randomly selecting one of the 1-m-long sections in both the pasture present and pasture excluded portions of each trench. Within this 1-m-long x 1-m-wide section of trench, nine 12-15-cm-diameter cylindrical holes were dug to a depth of 30 cm using a manually operated auger. They were positioned so that there were three rows each containing three holes, equal distances apart. Each hole was randomly allocated one of nine retrieval dates. These holes were then filled with a cylindrical PVC pipe (11 cm in diameter 30 cm in height) containing seed bags that had been buried at the designated burial 240 The Rangeland Journal F. F. Bebawi et al.  ^p depths using the same soil within respective trenches. Seed lots randomly selected to be tested at time zero were not buried, but directly subjected to germination and viability testing. The PVC pipes were perforated at the base and also had four holes drilled on the sides to allow for drainage. Blotting paper was placed at the base and in the holes to prevent soil loss but allow free drainage. Pipes were systematically filled on site using ~6.5 kg of soil, with a bag of seeds placed at depths of 0, 2.5, 10 and 20 cm. The top of the PVC pipe was then covered with rabbit mesh wire to prevent loss of bags containing seeds placed on the soil surface (0 cm in depth). Sensors connected to two separate data loggers (DT85 model - Data Electronics Pty Ltd, Brisbane, Qld, Australia) were inserted at each burial depth in dummy PVC pipes that were buried at the head of each soil trench to monitor soil temperature (Type K steel encased thermocouples) and soil moisture (SM200) on an hourly basis.  ^p The first seed lot of C. procera was buried in March 2009 with retrievals designated to occur 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, 60 and 72 months after burial or until no viable seeds were recorded for two consecutive retrievals. The second seed lot was buried in January 2012, with retrievals designated to occur 3, 6, 12, 15, 18, 24, 36, 48 and 60 months after burial. On each retrieval date, one PVC pipe from each replicate of the 16 soil type-pasture cover plots was randomly retrieved. The bags containing buried seeds were then removed from the PVC pipes and washed gently to remove attached soil particles.

  methods: The experiment was conducted at the Tropical Weeds Research Centre between September 2006 and December 2008. A completely randomised design with six replications was used to grow single plants of C. procera and C. gigantea in plastic pots (40 cm in diameter +/- 40 cm in depth) filled with garden soil potting mix. Pots were regularly watered to field capacity. Seeds of both C. procera and C. gigantea were collected in August 2006 and came from pods near the Gregory River (Fig. 1) in the Gulf of Carpentaria (188570S, 1398270E). Three seeds of C. procera and C. gigantea were initially sown and seedlings were subsequently thinned 3 weeks after emergence to one plant per pot. Number of seeds per pod of C. procera and C. gigantea averaged 486 +/- 10.1 (n = 14) and 127 +/- 12.2 (n = 14), respectively. Plant height (cm) and basal diameter (mm) at flowering and seed production (when first swollen follicle was observed) were recorded for each plant, along with days to flowering and seed production

  methods: To determine 'germinability', remaining intact seeds were removed from the bags and placed in Petri dishes (9 cm diameter) containing two layers of 'Whatman No. 1' filter paper moistened with 10mL of distilled water. These dishes were then placed into a growth cabinet set at 308C/208C day/night with alternating 12 h of light and dark. Germinable seeds (identified by radicle emergence) were counted and removed daily for 14 days. Seeds that did not germinate were checked for dormancy using the tetrazolium method (Moore 1985). Seed viability (germinable + dormant) was expressed as a per cent of total seeds initially buried. At the 3-month retrieval, the number of seeds that germinated in the packets was also recorded by counting emerged seedlings. However, this was not possible in later retrievals due to disintegration of emerged seedlings.

  methods: Based on a dichotomous key, developed by Thompson et al. (1997) and which classifies seed longevity into three categories [transient (viable <=1 year), short-term persistent (viable 1-5 year) and long-term persistent (viable >=5 year)], our results suggest that C. procera has a short-term persistent seed bank depending on prevailing conditions. This is consistent with the earlier prediction of Long et al. (2008), who suggested that seeds would persist for between 1 and 3 years.
