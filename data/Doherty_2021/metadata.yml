  description: A study to address two questions, 1) what is the response to high severity
    fire of vascular plant species found in subalpine, montane and tablelands plant
    communities? 2) does high severity fire result in significant or permanent change
    to vascular plant species richness and plant community composition as compared
    to low severity fire in subalpine, montane and tablelands plant communities and
    does the recovery rate vary with severity?

  sampling_strategy: In the first spring after the 2003 fire, all but seven out of
    a potential 163 sites in the two study areas were resampled using the methods
    outlined in Section 3.3. For sampling from 2004 onwards, a subset of 52 sites
    were sampled until 2012. The responses of all vascular plant species in Brindabella
    and Burrinjuck based on the resampling data for the first two post-fire samples
    in 2003 and 2004 was recorded as part of the resampling after the fires. Additionally,
    targeted surveys were also undertaken after the 2003 fires outside of the monitoring
    sites in specific rocky outcrop habitats in the Brindabella study area - Waterfall
    Creek, Mt. Coree, Genges Trig - known to contain pre-fire populations of fire-killed
    plant species which are rare or threatened, uncommon, or of conservation significance
    (Figure 4.1). Observations on species responses were consolidated after two seasons
    post-fire (i.e. after the 2004 sample), to allow for any staggered germination
    or delayed resprouting responses that may have occurred. ^p Populations of Leptospermum
    micromyrtus on the west side of Mt. Coree (Figure 4.1) were surveyed in spring
    2013, 10 years post-fire. The original pre-fire populations of Leptospermum micromyrtus
    were dominated by a small number of very large individuals which were all killed
    in the 2003 fires. Ring counts on selected cut-through stems indicated that the
    stand established in approximately 1950. ^p The fire response of the vascular
    plant species across the study areas was summarised using the Gill and Bradstock
    (1992) seven category system to categorise the response of reproductively mature
    plants to 100% leaf scorch (see Table 4.1). The use of this proportion standardises
    the response to the extreme end of fire intensity where plants will either die
    or resprout via a variety of mechanisms. Assessing mature plants ensures that
    any variation in susceptibility when plants are immature and either cannot resprout
    or do not have an in situ seed bank, is avoided. For fire-killed species in the
    study areas, this immaturity risk (Keeley and Fotheringham, 2000), was evaluated,
    with a particular focus on rare plant species and also for those species which
    are important structural dominants whose loss would lead to major structural and
    ecosystem changes (Avolio et al., 2019; Fisher et al., 2009; Grime and Hillier,
    2000; Lunt et al., 2012). ^p Because high severity fire effects the upper canopy
    structure, which has implications for subsequent understorey dynamics (Specht
    and Morgan, 1981), the fire responses of dominant canopy species were evaluated
    across the range of vegetation types to define broad structural response types.
