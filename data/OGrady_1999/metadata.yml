  description: Study that used heat pulse technology to measure whole-tree transpiration
    rates on a daily and seasonal basis for the two dominant eucalypts at a site near
    Darwin, Australia.
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: Site description ^p The study site was located in an E. miniata--E.
    tetrodonta open forest (sensu Specht 1981) about 50 km south-east of Darwin (130째45'E,
    12째30'S), Australia. The site was chosen because of its close proximity to a series
    of nested piezometers, neutron moisture meter access tubes and a weather station
    that logged temperature, relative humidity, light, wind speed, and wind direction.
    Vegetation at the site is characterized by an open canopy (less than 50% cover)
    of evergreen eucalypt trees with a mean canopy height of about 15 m. Leaf area
    index was typically low (about 1.0) and mean basal area was 8--10 m2 ha-1. The
    understory consisted of semi-deciduous and deciduous small trees and a seasonally
    continuous cover of annual and, to a small extent, perennial grasses. Seasonal
    changes in overstory leaf area index were small; however, understory leaf area
    index changes dramatically over the wet season with C4 Sorghum spp. dominating.
    These species senesce early in the dry season and thereafter understory leaf area
    index remains low (approximately 0.2) for the remainder of the dry season. Soils
    at the site are highly weathered sandy-clay laterites, and groundwater water levels
    vary between 1 and 15 m below the soil surface (Pidsley et al. 1994). Insolation,
    rainfall, temperature, humidity, wind speed and wind direction data have been
    recorded at the site since early 1994. ^p Mean hourly vapor pressure deficits
    (VPD) were larger in the dry season than in the wet season and peaked in the early
    afternoon in both seasons. Vapor pressure deficit varied from about 0.5 to 2.5
    kPa in the dry season and from 0.1 to 1.5 kPa in the wet season. Mean hourly temperatures
    were higher in the wet season (ranging from 23 to 31 째C) than in the dry season,
    when temperatures varied from 18 to 30 째C (Figure 1). Rainfall totals for the
    area were 1536, 2174 and 1800 mm for 1994, 1995 and 1996, respectively. Mean monthly
    evaporation and rainfall calculated for Darwin airport for the three-year period
    are shown in Figure 1 (Bureau of Meteorology).

  methods: Three E. miniata and three E. tetrodonta trees were instrumented during
    the wet and dry seasons over a three-year period (1995--1997). Trees were randomly
    selected and different trees were used for each sampling block. Heat pulse velocities
    were recorded at 15-min intervals for up to two weeks during each season. Mean
    daily transpiration rates (Ql) were analyzed as a fully fixed, three-factor analysis
    of variance with year, season and species as the factors.
