  description: sun versus shade leaf trait data from northern NSW
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: juvenile saplings
  sampling_strategy: Plant material for measurement of leaf traits was collected from
    a 15-yr-old second-growth stand of c. 10 ha in area, and distributions of juveniles
    in relation to canopy openness were quantified throughout both this stand and
    adjacent old-growth stands (see the following section). Both second-growth and
    oldgrowth stands grow on fertile soils derived from basalt (Turner & Kelly, 1981).
    The overstorey of the secondgrowth stand was dominated by Polyscias murrayi (F.Muell.)
    Harms (Araliaceae), whereas no one species prevailed in the much more diverse
    canopy of the old-growth forest. Thirteen common evergreens were chosen for study,
    ranging from species common in early successional environments, such as Polyscias
    elegans and Duboisia myoporoides, to those well represented in the understorey
    of the old-growth forest, including Anthocarapa nitidula and Castanospermum australe
    (Table 1).

    description: The study was carried out in subtropical rainforest in Nightcap National
      Park (New South Wales, Australia) located at 28deg38min S, 153deg20min E and
      at an elevation of 380 m asl. Mean annual temperature at the nearest meteorological
      station (Whian Whian) is estimated at 22.4C and mean annual rainfall at 2314
      mm, with a minimum in late winter to early spring (Bureau of Meteorology, 2009).
      No month receives less than 50 mm on average. Shade leaves were obtained from
      juveniles growing at 5-8% CO10 in the interior of the stand. Four to seven saplings
      per species were sampled in each light environment. There was no significant
      interspecific variation in mean light environments of either sun leaves (ANOVA,
      F = 1.19, P = 0.32) or shade leaves (F = 1.12, P = 0.36).

      No month receives less than 50 mm on average. Sun leaves were obtained from
      50-200 cm tall juveniles growing on the forest margin or in large canopy gaps;
      potentially suitable plants were marked and hemispherical photographs were then
      taken to ensure selection only of plants growing at 15-24% CO10. This range
      of canopy openness is roughly equivalent to light intensities measured beneath
      300-700 m2 treefall gaps in tropical rainforest by Brown (1993). There was no
      significant interspecific variation in mean light environments of either sun
      leaves (ANOVA, F = 1.19, P = 0.32) or shade leaves (F = 1.12, P = 0.36).

  methods: One to three leaves or leaflets (without petioles or petiolules) were collected
    from each sapling, choosing the youngest fully expanded intact leaves on each  plant.
    Growth is opportunistic in Australian subtropical rainforest, and although we
    sampled early during the winter, most plants were still producing new leaves.
    The leaves we sampled were therefore likely to be of a similar age in most plants.
    Leaves with major insect damage were avoided. Leaves were collected during the
    morning and kept on ice; leaf areas were measured before drying, which began within
    36 h of collection. Projected areas of fresh samples were measured using a LI-3100
    Leaf Area Meter (Li-Cor Biosciences, Lincoln, NE,USA). Fresh samples were weighed,
    and then dried at 60C, to determine LMA (g m)2) and dry matter content.

  methods: Cell wall mass per unit area. The neutral detergent fibre method (Van Soest
    et al., 1991) was used to estimate cell wall content of samples. Dried leaf samples
    were ground and sieved with a 1-mm-diameter mesh. Ground samples of 40 mg were
    boiled for 1 h in a solution with 8 ml of neutral detergent and 4 ll of heat-stable
    amylase. Samples were then centrifuged for 5 min at 2500 g. The pellets were centrifuged
    three times with deionized water and once more with ethanol, spinning for 5 min
    at 2500 g each time. Pellets were dried at 60_C to a constant weight to determine
    the cell wall fraction of the leaf, and cell wall mass per unit area (CWA, g cm)2).
    The lost mass was considered to represent the nonstructural dry mass of the leaf
    (i.e. the cell contents).

  methods: We employed two methods to evaluate leaf resistance to fracture but at
    different scales. A punch-and-die test was used for intercostal regions of the
    lamina (between secondary veins), the regions preferentially targeted by most
    insect herbivores (Choong, 1996). A shear test was used to measure lamina resistance
    to fracture at a larger scale, including secondary veins but excluding the midrib.
    A Mitutoyo micrometer was used to measure lamina thickness at the points selected
    for punch tests, and in the regions selected for shear tests.   ^p    An Instron
    5542 materials testing machine (Instron, Canton, MA, USA) was used to conduct
    punch-and-die tests. We built a flat-ended, sharp-edged cylindrical steel punch
    (2.0 mm diameter) and a steel die with a sharpedged aperture of small clearance
    (0.05 mm), which allowed us to fracture leaves mainly by shearing, rather than
    tensile or bending forces (Aranwela et al., 1999; Onoda et al., 2008). The punch-and-die
    test cell was mounted in the testing machine, and the punch was set up to pass
    through the middle of the hole of the die without any friction. The punch speed
    was kept constant (10 mm min-1) and the machine simultaneously recorded load (N)
    applied to sample and displacement (mm) of the punch (every 50 ms). We applied
    this punch-and-die test to intercostal regions of the lamina, averaging two measurements
    on each replicate leaf. Lamina thickness was measured at the point of fracture.
    The maximum force (Fmax) was expressed per unit fracture length, that is, the
    circumference of the punch. We refer to this throughout as 'force to punch' (N
    m-1).

    used a leaf-cutting machine developed by Wright & Cannon (2001) to conduct shear
    tests. This machine measures the force required to cut a leaf at a constant cutting
    angle (20_) and speed (3.9 mm min1), and is similar in principle to systems described
    by Darvell et al. (1996) and Aranwela et al. (1999). A leaf was fractured with
    a single transverse cut perpendicular to the midrib, equidistant between the base
    and the apex (Wright & Cannon, 2001). The work required to fracture a leaf was
    analysed separately for the midrib and for the rest of the lamina, including some
    secondary veins. Only the latter data are shown in this paper. The work was expressed
    per unit fracture length (J m-1) and per unit fracture area (J m-2); in the terminology
    of materials engineering these are known as 'work to shear' and 'specific work
    to shear', respectively (Sanson et al., 2001). The former has been referred to
    as 'fracture toughness' in some biomechanical studies (Aranwela et al., 1999).

    order to derive an index of the cost-benefit economics of herbivory (see later
    in this section).
