  description: sun versus shade leaf trait data from northern NSW
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: juvenile saplings
  sampling_strategy: Plant material for measurement of leaf traits was collected from
    a 15-yr-old second-growth stand of c. 10 ha in area, and distributions of juveniles
    in relation to canopy openness were quantified throughout both this stand and
    adjacent old-growth stands (see the following section). Both second-growth and
    oldgrowth stands grow on fertile soils derived from basalt (Turner & Kelly, 1981).
    The overstorey of the secondgrowth stand was dominated by Polyscias murrayi (F.Muell.)
    Harms (Araliaceae), whereas no one species prevailed in the much more diverse
    canopy of the old-growth forest. Thirteen common evergreens were chosen for study,
    ranging from species common in early successional environments, such as Polyscias
    elegans and Duboisia myoporoides, to those well represented in the understorey
    of the old-growth forest, including Anthocarapa nitidula and Castanospermum australe
    (Table 1).

    description: The study was carried out in subtropical rainforest in Nightcap National
      Park (New South Wales, Australia) located at 28deg38min S, 153deg20min E and
      at an elevation of 380 m asl. Mean annual temperature at the nearest meteorological
      station (Whian Whian) is estimated at 22.4C and mean annual rainfall at 2314
      mm, with a minimum in late winter to early spring (Bureau of Meteorology, 2009).
      No month receives less than 50 mm on average. Shade leaves were
      obtained from juveniles growing at 5-8% CO10 in the interior of the stand.
      Four to seven saplings per species were sampled in each light environment. There
      was no significant interspecific variation in mean light environments of either
      sun leaves (ANOVA, F = 1.19, P = 0.32) or shade leaves (F = 1.12, P = 0.36).

      No month receives less than 50 mm on average. Sun leaves were
      obtained from 50-200 cm tall juveniles growing on the forest margin or
      in large canopy gaps; potentially suitable plants were marked and hemispherical
      photographs were then taken to ensure selection only of plants growing at 15-24%
      CO10. This range of canopy openness is roughly equivalent to light intensities
      measured beneath 300-700 m2 treefall gaps in tropical rainforest by Brown
      (1993). There was no significant interspecific variation in mean light environments
      of either sun leaves (ANOVA, F = 1.19, P = 0.32) or shade leaves (F = 1.12,
      P = 0.36).

  methods: One to three leaves or leaflets (without petioles or petiolules) were collected from each sapling, choosing the youngest fully expanded intact leaves on each  plant. Growth is opportunistic in Australian subtropical rainforest, and although we sampled early during the winter, most plants were still producing new leaves. The leaves we sampled were therefore likely to be of a similar age in most plants. Leaves with major insect damage were avoided. Leaves were collected during the morning and kept on ice; leaf areas were measured before drying, which began within 36 h of collection. Projected areas of fresh samples were measured using a LI-3100 Leaf Area Meter (Li-Cor Biosciences, Lincoln, NE,USA). Fresh samples were weighed, and then dried at 60C, to determine LMA (g m)2) and dry matter content.

  methods: Cell wall mass per unit area. The neutral detergent fibre method (Van Soest et al., 1991) was used to estimate cell wall content of samples. Dried leaf samples were ground and sieved with a 1-mm-diameter mesh. Ground samples of 40 mg were boiled for 1 h in a solution with 8 ml of neutral detergent and 4 ll of heat-stable amylase. Samples were then centrifuged for 5 min at 2500 g. The pellets were centrifuged three times with deionized water and once more with ethanol, spinning for 5 min at 2500 g each time. Pellets were dried at 60_C to a constant weight to determine the cell wall fraction of the leaf, and cell wall mass per unit area (CWA, g cm)2). The lost mass was considered to represent the nonstructural dry mass of the leaf (i.e. the cell contents).

  methods: We employed two methods to evaluate leaf resistance to fracture but at different scales. A punch-and-die test was used for intercostal regions of the lamina (between secondary veins), the regions preferentially targeted by most insect herbivores (Choong, 1996). A shear test was used to measure lamina resistance to fracture at a larger scale, including secondary veins but excluding the midrib. A Mitutoyo micrometer was used to measure lamina thickness at the points selected for punch tests, and in the regions selected for shear tests.   ^p    An Instron 5542 materials testing machine (Instron, Canton, MA, USA) was used to conduct punch-and-die tests. We built a flat-ended, sharp-edged cylindrical steel punch (2.0 mm diameter) and a steel die with a sharpedged aperture of small clearance (0.05 mm), which allowed us to fracture leaves mainly by shearing, rather than tensile or bending forces (Aranwela et al., 1999; Onoda et al., 2008). The punch-and-die test cell was mounted in the testing machine, and the punch was set up to pass through the middle of the hole of the die without any friction. The punch speed was kept constant (10 mm min-1) and the machine simultaneously recorded load (N) applied to sample and displacement (mm) of the punch (every 50 ms). We applied this punch-and-die test to intercostal regions of the lamina, averaging two measurements on each replicate leaf. Lamina thickness was measured at the point of fracture. The maximum force (Fmax) was expressed per unit fracture length, that is, the circumference of the punch. We refer to this throughout as 'force to punch' (N m-1).

This machine measures the force required to cut a leaf at a constant cutting angle (20_) and speed (3.9 mm min1), and is similar in principle to systems described by Darvell et al. (1996) and Aranwela et al. (1999). A leaf was fractured with a single transverse cut perpendicular to the midrib, equidistant between the base and the apex (Wright & Cannon, 2001). The work required to fracture a leaf was analysed separately for the midrib and for the rest of the lamina, including some secondary veins. Only the latter data are shown in this paper. The work was expressed per unit fracture length (J m-1) and per unit fracture area (J m-2); in the terminology of materials engineering these are known as 'work to shear' and 'specific work to shear', respectively (Sanson et al., 2001). The former has been referred to as 'fracture toughness' in some biomechanical studies (Aranwela et al., 1999).

Force to punch was also converted to a surface area basis (kN m-2) in order to derive an index of the cost–benefit economics of herbivory (see later in this section).
