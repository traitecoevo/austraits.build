  description: A study investigating how temporal and spatial variation in avaliability
    of water and nutrients influences the vegetation on dunes and interdunes in the
    Great Sandy Desert, Western Australia.
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: unknown
  sampling_strategy: The study area was located 350 km inland of Port Hedland, Australia,
    near Nifty Copper Operation (21°40'S, 121°35'E) in the Great Sandy Desert of northern
    Western Australia (see map, Fig. 1). The landscape as a whole is remarkably flat
    with an average elevation above sea level of ~300m (Rockwater Hydrology Report,
    Rockwater Pty Ltd 2003). Without any surface drainage channels in the area, rainwater
    typically soaks in directly where it falls; even on the dune slopes. Long, linear
    sand dunes and braided dunes characterise the landscape (Fig. 2a), ranging in
    height from 3 to 37 m, with an average height of 12 m and a base of 100 m (Beard
    1969). These dunes generally are aligned west-north-west to east-south-east (Beard
    1969). The sand grains of the dune are slightly coarser than, but generally similar
    to, the dune sands of other desert areas of the world, but have an iron oxide
    patina, giving them a rusty red colour (Brown 1959). Interdunes range in width
    from less than 50 m for braided dunes to more than 1500 m for linear dunes. Below
    the surface of the interdunes, a lateritic gravel layer generally begins at 50
    cm, eventually forming a conglomerated ironstone hardpan by 2-3 m. This hardpan
    underlies the landscape as a flat pavement and continues beneath the dunes without
    conforming to their shape. A white kaolinite/muscovite clay horizon is found typically
    between 8 and 20 m below this hardpan layer and supports a perched water table
    (Nifty Copper Mine Drill Log 2003). Average depth to water beneath most interdunes
    throughout the area is ~10-12 m, and in some low-lying depressions maybe <5 m
    from the surface (Nifty Copper Mine Drill Log 2003; Rockwater Pty Ltd 2003). Adjacent
    dunes and interdunes were selected as study sites where flat sections across the
    interdune exceeded 300 m and remained unburnt for at least 10 years. Vegetation
    was very similar on all dunes throughout the area, with the most prominent species
    being the eucalypt Corymbia chippendalei (Myrtaceae). These trees were only ever
    found on the uppermost sections of the sandy ridges. Other common dune species
    included Grevillea stenobotrya (Proteaceae), Acacia  jensenii (Fabaceae) and Triodia
    schinzii (Poaceae). Most interdunes were characterised by scattered shrubs such
    as Grevillea wickhamii (Proteaceae), Acacia ancistrocarpa (Fabaceae) and cover
    was dominated by Triodia basedowii. In lower-lying areas of some interdunal flats,
    small-statured Eucalyptus victrix and Melaleuca species (Myrtaceae) co-occurred
    on gravely patches, with a brackish water table often within 5 m of the surface.
    We carried out comparative measurements on plant water relations and nutrition
    of three congeneric or closely related dune-interdune species pairs, representing
    three different functional groups. During the course of 2 years, we examined water
    relations and photosynthesis of six dominant woody species throughout each season,
    in addition to foliar delta 13C, delta 15N and nutrient composition. Adjacent
    dunes and interdunes were selected as study sites where flat sections across the
    interdune exceeded 300 m and remained unburnt for at least 10 years. table often
    within 5 m of the surface. Information on water and nutrient relations are presented
    here for woody species of three functional types, including (1) the non-leguminous,
    mycorrhizal, relatively large eucalypt trees (C. chippendalei and E. victrix),
    (2) the smaller, non-mycorrhizal, cluster-bearing proteaceous tree-shrubs (G.
    stenobotrya and G. wickhamii) and (3) the leguminous, mycorrhizal, multi-stemmed
    shrubs (A. jensenii and A. ancistrocarpa). A companion paper presenting data for
    the two spinifex grass species, T. schinzii and T. basedowii, is in preparation

  methods: Leaf water potential was measured with a Scholander-type pressure chamber
    (PMS Instruments, Corvallis, Oregon, USA). During the course of two consecutive
    years, eight sampling periods, each of 10 days, were carried out so as to capture
    each season twice. Leaf water potential measurements were taken at predawn (0300-0500
    hours) and midday (1200-1400 hours) on randomly selected individuals from different
    locations within each plant community. Three twig/shoot sections, ~10 cm long
    displaying two to nine leaves (depending on species) were cut from three to five
    individuals. On being cut, leaves were sealed in zip-lock plastic bags with only
    the petiole protruding and placed inside the pressure bomb to begin measurements
    within 1 min of being excised from the plant.

  methods: Gas exchange was measured on intact leaves in the field with a Li-Cor 6400
    portable infrared gas analyser (LI-COR Inc. Lincoln, NE, USA). Measurements of
    rate of photosynthesis (A) and stomatal conductance (gs) started in January 2001
    and finished in January 2003, were spaced roughly 3 months apart and were always
    carried out between 1000 and 1400 hours on predominantly sunny days. An artificial
    light source of red and blue LEDs was used to administer a photosynthetic photon
    flux density (PPFD) of 1500 µmol m-2 s-1 at all times and in all seasons. Leaf
    chamber carbon dioxide concentration was between 360 and 375 µmol CO2 mol-1, with
    reference gas maintained at 380 µmol CO2 mol-1. Vapour pressure and temperature
    in the chamber were maintained as close as possible to those of ambient air. Leaf
    temperatures were calculated by using an energy balance equation (Li-Cor 6400
    Manual Li-Cor 2000). Measurements were done on the youngest fully expanded mature
    leaves. Only those that were healthy, without notable insect damage and located
    on the northern side of the crown were selected for measurement. Species assessed
    for leaf gas exchange included C. chippendalei, E. victrix (both Myrtaceae), A.
    jensenii, A. ancistrocarpa (Fabaceae), G. stenobotrya and G. wickhamii (Proteaceae).
    At least three measurements were taken on leaves of each plant and between three
    and seven individuals were assessed for every species at all sampling times. Measured
    leaf sections were sealed in zip-lock plastic bags, chilled and taken to the laboratory
    where their leaf areas were measured on a back-lit flatbed scanner at a scanning
    resolution of 0.2 um (WinRhizo V3.0.3 1995, Regent Instruments Quebec, Canada).
    Once areas were determined, leaves were oven-dried at 70°C for 1 week and then
    dry weights recorded.

  entity_type: population
  value_type: mean
  basis_of_value: measurement
  replicates: 5
  methods: Healthy leaves, free from insect attack, from at least five individuals,
    were collected for C (delta13C) and N (delta15N) isotope composition from each
    of the six species during the dry season (July) 2002. From each individual, 20-50
    leaves were cut from three branches on the northern side of the crown, air-dried
    in the field, oven-dried at 70°C in the laboratory, then ground with a ball mill.
    A special collection of G. stenobotrya leaves was also obtained from individuals
    at three locations on the interdunes for direct comparison with plants of this
    species growing in its preferred habitat on the dunes. Delta13C analysis was performed
    by continuous flow mass spectrometry (Roboprep + Tracermass Ion Ratio Mass Spectrometer,
    Europa Scientific, Crewe, UK). 13C to 12C ratios of the CO2 produced by combustion
    at 1000°C in an oxygen atmosphere were then compared against those obtained by
    combustion of a cornflour standard (ANCA 53), calibrated in turn against the international
    standard NBS-22. Analytical precision was based on multiple replicate analyses
    for delta13C = ±0.2per-mille relative to the PeeDee Belemnite standard.

    the field, oven-dried at 70°C in the laboratory, and then ground with a ball mill.
    A subsample of leaf material was digested with a mixture of nitric and perchloric
    acids (McQuaker et al. 1979), and then analysed by ICP-AES (Varian Vista axial
    spectrometer, Palo Alto, CA, USA) to determine concentrations of P, K, Ca, Mg,
    S, B, Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn.
