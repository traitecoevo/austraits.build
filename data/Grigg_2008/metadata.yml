  description: A study investigating how the temporal and spatial variation in avaliability
    of water and nutrients influences the vegetation on dunes and interdunes in the
    Great Sandy Desert, Western Australia.
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: unknown
  sampling_strategy: We carried out comparative measurements on plant water relations
    and nutrition of three congeneric or closely related dune-interdune species pairs,
    representing three different functional groups. During the course of 2 years,
    we examined water relations and photosynthesis of six dominant woody species throughout
    each season, in addition to foliar delta 13C,  delta 15N and nutrient composition.
    Adjacent dunes and interdunes were selected as study sites where flat sections
    across the interdune exceeded 300 m and remained unburnt for at least 10 years.

    description: The study area was located 350km inland of Port Hedland, Australia,
      near Nifty Copper Operation (21◦40S, 121◦35E) in the Great Sandy Desert of northern
      Western Australia. Without any surface drainage channels in the area, rainwater
      typically soaks in directly where it falls; even on the dune slopes.

    description: Measurements taken from plants growing on the dunes. Long, linear
      sand dunes and braided dunes characterise the landscape, ranging in height from
      3 to 37 m, with an average height of 12 m and a base of 100 m (Beard 1969).
      These dunes generally are aligned west-north-west to east-south-east (Beard
      1969).The sand grains of the dune are slightly coarser than, but generally similar
      to, the dune sands of other desert areas of the world, but have an iron oxide
      patina, giving them a rusty red colour (Brown 1959).
  - value: interdunes
    description: Measurements taken from plants growing on the interdunes. Interdunes
      range in width from less than 50 m for braided dunes to more than 1500 m for
      linear dunes. Below the surface of the interdunes, a lateritic gravel layer
      generally begins at 50 cm, eventually forming a conglomerated ironstone hardpan
      by 2-3 m.

  methods: Leaf water potential was measured with a Scholander-type pressure chamber
    (PMS Instruments, Corvallis, Oregon, USA). During the course of two consecutive
    years, eight sampling periods, each of 10 days, were carried out so as to capture
    each season twice. The seasons were named according to time since summer rains;
    hence, the 'wet' season typically occurred from January to March, 'early' in the
    dry season is from April to June, 'middle' of the dry season is from July to September
    and 'late' in the dry season is from October to December. During the course of
    the present study, wet-season rains began in January of each year. Leaf water
    potential measurements were taken at predawn (0300-0500 hours) and midday (1200-1400
    hours) on randomly selected individuals from different locations within each plant
    community. Three twig/shoot sections, ~10 cm long displaying two to nine leaves
    (depending on species) were cut from three to five individuals. On being cut,
    leaves were sealed in zip-lock plastic bags with only the petiole protruding and
    placed inside the pressure bomb to begin measurements within 1 min of being excised
    from the plant.

  methods: Gas exchange was measured on intact leaves in the field with a Li-Cor 6400
    portable infrared gas analyser (LI-COR Inc. Lincoln, NE, USA). Measurements of
    rate of photosynthesis (A) and stomatal conductance (gs) started in January 2001
    and finished in January 2003, were spaced roughly 3 months apart and were always
    carried out between 1000 and 1400 hours on predominantly sunny days. An artificial
    light source of red and blue LEDs was used to administer a photosynthetic photon
    flux density (PPFD) of 1500 µmol m-2 s-1 at all times and in all seasons. Leaf
    chamber carbon dioxide concentration was between 360 and 375 µmol CO2 mol-1, with
    reference gas maintained at 380 µmol CO2 mol-1. Vapour pressure and temperature
    in the chamber were maintained as close as possible to those of ambient air. Leaf
    temperatures were calculated by using an energy balance equation (Li-Cor 6400
    Manual Li-Cor 2000). Measurements were done on the youngest fully expanded mature
    leaves. Only those that were healthy, without notable insect damage and located
    on the northern side of the crown were selected for measurement. Species assessed
    for leaf gas exchange included C. chippendalei, E. victrix (both Myrtaceae), A.
    jensenii, A. ancistrocarpa (Fabaceae), G. stenobotrya and G. wickhamii (Proteaceae).
    At least three measurements were taken on leaves of each plant and between three
    and seven individuals were assessed for every species at all sampling times. Measured
    leaf sections were sealed in zip-lock plastic bags, chilled and taken to the laboratory
    where their leaf areas were measured on a back-lit flatbed scanner at a scanning
    resolution of 0.2 µm (WinRhizo V3.0.3 1995, Regent Instruments Quebec, Canada).
    Once areas were determined, leaves were oven-dried at 70◦C for 1 week and then
    dry weights recorded.

  methods: Healthy leaves, free from insect attack, from at least five individuals,
    were collected for C (delta13C) and N (delta15N) isotope composition from each of the
    six species during the dry season (July) 2002. From each individual, 20-50 leaves
    were cut from three branches on the northern side of the crown, air-dried in the
    field, oven-dried at 70◦ C in the laboratory, then ground with a ball mill. A
    special collection of G. stenobotrya leaves was also obtained from individuals
    at three locations on the interdunes for direct comparison with plants of this
    species growing in its preferred habitat on the dunes. delta13C analysis was performed
    by continuous flow mass spectrometry (Roboprep + Tracermass Ion Ratio Mass Spectrometer,
    Europa Scientific, Crewe, UK). 13C / 12C ratios of the CO2 produced by combustion
    at 1000◦C in an oxygen atmosphere were then compared against those obtained by
    combustion of a cornflour standard (ANCA 53), calibrated in turn against the international
    standard NBS-22. 15N / 14N ratios were compared against a radish standard (ANCA
    54), calibrated against known international standards (IAEA-N1, IAEA-N2, IAEA
    NO3). Analytical precision was based on multiple replicate analyses for delta13C =
    ±0.2per-mille relative to the PeeDee Belemnite standard; for delta15N = ±0.3 per-mille relative to
    air. Carbon isotope composition was used to estimate the ratio between leaf internal
    and ambient CO2 concentration when that C was being fixed, by using the equations
    for C3 plants outlined in Farquhar et al. (1982).

    20-50 leaves were cut from the three branches and were air-dried in the field,
    oven-dried at 70◦C in the laboratory, and then ground with a ball mill. A subsample
    of leaf material was digested with a mixture of nitric and perchloric acids (McQuaker
    et al. 1979), and then analysed by ICP-AES (Varian Vista axial spectrometer, Palo
    Alto, CA, USA) to determine concentrations of P, K, Ca, Mg, S, B, Cu, Fe, Mn and
    Zn.

  methods: A subsample of the leaf material collected for isotope composition, which
    consisted of healthy leaves from three branches of at least five individuals of
    each species collected during the dry season (July) 2002, was used for nutrient
    analysis. 20-50 leaves were cut from the three branches and were air-dried in
    the field, oven-dried at 70◦C in the laboratory, and then ground with a ball mill.
