  description: A study to investigate the effect the season and frequency of fires
    have on the survival of serotinous species
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: The study area was located near Mt Adams (29°25'S, 114°58'E),
    about 330 km north of Perth, Western Australia. Soils are deep, infertile aeolian
    sands on a gently undulating coastal plain. The climate is dry, warm, mediterranean
    (Beard 1976). The mean annual rainfall at Dongara, 25 km north of the study area,
    is 487 mm. At Eneabba, 50 km south of the study area, mean maximum temperatures
    in January (hottest month) and mean minimum temperatures in July (coldest month)
    are 35.6 deg C and 9.1 deg C, respectively. Absolute maximum temperatures in excess
    of 40 deg C are recorded from December to March (Bureau of Meteorology 1959).
    The vegetation at the study area is a Banksia-dominated scrub-heath with a tall
    (1.5-4.0 m) shrub stratum over a closed layer of heath shrubs 1-m tall (Beard
    1976). We chose a homogeneous 4.8-ha area for intensive study. The only other
    prominent overstorey shrub was Actinostrobus arenarius. Understorey shrubs included
    species of Beaufortia, Calytrix, Conospermum, Hakea, Leptospermum and Petrophile.
    At the time of sampling, the vegetation had last been burnt fifteen years ago
    (Western Australian Bushfires Board, personal communication).

  methods: The number of open inflorescences was counted on fifteen randomly chosen
    individuals of each species at monthly intervals between May 1983 and February
    1984. We also recorded the number of fresh inflorescences beneath each shrub which
    had been removed from the plant as a result of foraging by white-tailed black
    cockatoos (Calyptorhyncus funerus latirostris).

  methods: We harvested all the cones from fifteen randomly chosen individuals of
    each species. Cone age was estimated from node counts except for B. leptophylla
    where cones were grouped into four classes (1-3, 4-6, 7-9, 10-12 years) on the
    basis of the relative persistence and extent of fading of the floral remnants
    on the cone. Cones were returned to the laboratory where the numbers of open,
    closed and predated follicles per cone were counted (Scott 1982). We burned the
    cones with an oxy-acetyline torch until all follicles had ruptured. The burnt
    cones were placed in trays in a glasshouse and periodically immersed in water
    to promote seed release (Cowling & Lamont 1985). Seeds were classified as firm
    (apparently viable), aborted or predated. We tested the viability of firm seed
    by germinating three replicate batches of fifteen seeds of each species in each
    of three age classes (1-3, 4-6, 7-9 years), as well as 10-12 year-old seed of
    B. leptophylla, in Petri dishes on moistened filter paper at 15 deg C over fifty
    days.

    seed of B. leptophylla, in Petri dishes on moistened filter paper at 15 deg C
    over fifty days.
