  description: Compilation of data from Susanne Schmidt
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: Eucalyptus tetrodonta and E. miniata dominate the most distinctive
    savanna community in northern Australia. Acacia species are prominent understorey
    species in this open forest community. Other genera of tree and shrub species
    sampled in this study include Alstonia, Buchanania, Calytrix, Clerodendrum, Cochlospermum,
    Dolichandrone, Erythrophleum, Ficus, Gardenia, Grevillea, Lophostemon, Melaleuca,
    Owenia, Parinari, Persoonia, Petalostigma, Planchonia, Terminalia, and Xanthostemon.
    Soils are mostly well drained sandy loams or loams which remain temporarily water
    saturated during the wet season. The sandstone escarpment in Kakadu National Park
    supports open Eucalyptus woodland with sparse canopy and ground cover (Brock 1988).
    Escarpment species were studied at Koongarra Saddle and included many species
    in the same genera as listed for the savanna woodland. In addition, Allosyncarpia,
    Bossiaea, Calycopeplus, Dampiera, Gompholobium, Maytenus, Myrtella, Pityrodia,
    Plagiocarpus, Solanum, and Vitex were sampled. A deciduous monsoon forest near
    'Holiday Village' was studied and genera sampled included Acacia, Adenanthera,
    Canarium, Cathormion, Cupaniopsis, Elaeocarpus, Eucalyptus, Exocarpus, Ficus,
    Ganophyllum, Glycosmis, Litsea, Planchonia, Strychnos, Terminalia, Trema, Vitex,
    and Wrightia. The monsoon forest has moderately drained clayey red soil close
    to the flood plains. Herbaceous species in each community were sampled and included
    members of the following families- Araceae, Asteraceae, Commelinacae, Convolvulaceae,
    Curcurbitaceae, Cyperaceae, Dilleniaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Fabaceae, Goodeniaceae,
    Haemodoraceae, Poaceae, Liliaceae, Polygalaceae, Portulacaceae, Taccaceae, Tiliaceae,
    Vitaceae, and Xanthorrhoeaceae.
  original_file: schmidt data for RhysWhitleyJuly2012.xls (there are also other files in the e-mail chain)
  notes: There are data for additional Kakadu sites in the raw data files, but only species name abbreviations are given. This expanded file is saved as "data_new.csv" but is not currently being used. Some of the d15N values (in both files) are way off - they seems like %C values. It is clear they are wrong, because for many species there are replicate measurements and only one of them falls far outside the expected range.

    description: waste rock dump; The study was carried out in the Alligator Rivers Region of Kakadu
      National Park within a 30 km radius of Jabiru (12.39ºS, 132.55ºE) and near Darwin
      (12.30ºS, 131.6ºE, Howard River East catchment) in northern Australia. The climate
      is distinctly monsoonal with a long dry season (May-October) followed by a wet
      season (December-March) during which 90% of the average annual precipitation
      of 1,475 mm is received. Maximum and minimum monthly temperatures range from
      18 to 25ºC and 31 to 37ºC in the dry and wet seasons, respectively. Sampling
      occurred in mid dry season (July 1994), late dry season (September 1996, 1997),
      early wet season (December 1995), and mid wet season (February 1995, January
      1998). An annually burnt subsection (segment L) of the CSIRO Kapalga fire research
      site was compared with savanna that had not been burnt for 4 years at Kapalga
      (segment M) and one that had been burnt 2 years prior to sampling near Jabiru.
