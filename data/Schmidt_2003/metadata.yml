  description: Compilation of data from Susanne Schmidt published in 10.1007/s00442-002-1150-y
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: Eucalyptus tetrodonta and E. miniata dominate the most distinctive
    savanna community in northern Australia. Acacia species are prominent understorey
    species in this open forest community. Other genera of tree and shrub species
    sampled in this study include Alstonia, Buchanania, Calytrix, Clerodendrum, Cochlospermum,
    Dolichandrone, Erythrophleum, Ficus, Gardenia, Grevillea, Lophostemon, Melaleuca,
    Owenia, Parinari, Persoonia, Petalostigma, Planchonia, Terminalia, and Xanthostemon.
    Soils are mostly well drained sandy loams or loams which remain temporarily water
    saturated during the wet season. The sandstone escarpment in Kakadu National Park
    supports open Eucalyptus woodland with sparse canopy and ground cover (Brock 1988).
    Escarpment species were studied at Koongarra Saddle and included many species
    in the same genera as listed for the savanna woodland. In addition, Allosyncarpia,
    Bossiaea, Calycopeplus, Dampiera, Gompholobium, Maytenus, Myrtella, Pityrodia,
    Plagiocarpus, Solanum, and Vitex were sampled. A deciduous monsoon forest near
    'Holiday Village' was studied and genera sampled included Acacia, Adenanthera,
    Canarium, Cathormion, Cupaniopsis, Elaeocarpus, Eucalyptus, Exocarpus, Ficus,
    Ganophyllum, Glycosmis, Litsea, Planchonia, Strychnos, Terminalia, Trema, Vitex,
    and Wrightia. The monsoon forest has moderately drained clayey red soil close
    to the flood plains. Herbaceous species in each community were sampled and included
    members of the following families- Araceae, Asteraceae, Commelinacae, Convolvulaceae,
    Curcurbitaceae, Cyperaceae, Dilleniaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Fabaceae, Goodeniaceae,
    Haemodoraceae, Poaceae, Liliaceae, Polygalaceae, Portulacaceae, Taccaceae, Tiliaceae,
    Vitaceae, and Xanthorrhoeaceae.

    description: The study was carried out in the Alligator Rivers Region of Kakadu
      National Park within a 30 km radius of Jabiru (12.39°S, 132.55°E) and near Darwin
      (12.30°S, 131.6°E, Howard River East catchment) in northern Australia. The climate
      is distinctly monsoonal with a long dry season (May–October) followed by a wet
      season (December–March) during which 90% of the average annual precipitation
      of 1,475 mm is received. Maximum and minimum monthly temperatures range from
      18 to 25°C and 31 to 37°C in the dry and wet seasons, respectively. Sampling
      occurred in mid dry season (July 1994), late dry season (September 1996, 1997),
      early wet season (December 1995), and mid wet season (February 1995, January
      1998). An annually burnt subsection (segment L) of the CSIRO Kapalga fire research
      site was compared with savanna that had not been burnt for 4 years at Kapalga
      (segment M) and one that had been burnt 2 years prior to sampling near Jabiru.

questions:
  austraits: one of the manuscripts goals is to disintguish between
    isotope signatures of species with different myco associations, but this data
    is not included. It probably should be.
  contributor: I want to make sure I correctly understand that for each species
    there was a single bulked sample analysed for isotopes/nutrients and the error
    bars shown in the manuscript represent a mean/Std dev across multiple species
    at a site. Also, what methods were used to collect leaf P data? 
    Last, I assume all the Poaceae species with high d13C values are C4 grasses. 
    But I want to confirm that the scattered species with high d15N signatures are the correct values.
