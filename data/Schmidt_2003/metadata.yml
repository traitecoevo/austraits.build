  description: Susanne Schmidt's Kakadu data, merged from several spreadsheets
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: Eucalyptus tetrodonta and E. miniata dominate the most distinctive
    savanna community in northern Australia. Acacia species are prominent understorey
    species in this open forest community. Other genera of tree and shrub species
    sampled in this study include Alstonia, Buchanania, Calytrix, Clerodendrum, Cochlospermum,
    Dolichandrone, Erythrophleum, Ficus, Gardenia, Grevillea, Lophostemon, Melaleuca,
    Owenia, Parinari, Persoonia, Petalostigma, Planchonia, Terminalia, and Xanthostemon.
    Soils are mostly well drained sandy loams or loams which remain temporarily water
    saturated during the wet season. The sandstone escarpment in Kakadu National Park
    supports open Eucalyptus woodland with sparse canopy and ground cover (Brock 1988).
    Escarpment species were studied at Koongarra Saddle and included many species
    in the same genera as listed for the savanna woodland. In addition, Allosyncarpia,
    Bossiaea, Calycopeplus, Dampiera, Gompholobium, Maytenus, Myrtella, Pityrodia,
    Plagiocarpus, Solanum, and Vitex were sampled. A deciduous monsoon forest near
    'Holiday Village' was studied and genera sampled included Acacia, Adenanthera,
    Canarium, Cathormion, Cupaniopsis, Elaeocarpus, Eucalyptus, Exocarpus, Ficus,
    Ganophyllum, Glycosmis, Litsea, Planchonia, Strychnos, Terminalia, Trema, Vitex,
    and Wrightia. The monsoon forest has moderately drained clayey red soil close
    to the flood plains. Herbaceous species in each community were sampled and included
    members of the following families- Araceae, Asteraceae, Commelinacae, Convolvulaceae,
    Curcurbitaceae, Cyperaceae, Dilleniaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Fabaceae, Goodeniaceae,
    Haemodoraceae, Poaceae, Liliaceae, Polygalaceae, Portulacaceae, Taccaceae, Tiliaceae,
    Vitaceae, and Xanthorrhoeaceae. The study was carried out in the Alligator Rivers
    Region of Kakadu National Park within a 30 km radius of Jabiru (12.39degS, 132.55degE)
    and near Darwin (12.30degS, 131.6degE, Howard River East catchment) in northern
    Australia. The climate is distinctly monsoonal with a long dry season (May-October)
    followed by a wet season (December-March) during which 90% of the average annual
    precipitation of 1,475 mm is received. Maximum and minimum monthly temperatures
    range from 18 to 25degC and 31 to 37degC in the dry and wet seasons, respectively.
    Sampling occurred in mid dry season (July 1994), late dry season (September 1996,
    1997), early wet season (December 1995), and mid wet season (February 1995, January
    1998). An annually burnt subsection (segment L) of the CSIRO Kapalga fire research
    site was compared with savanna that had not been burnt for 4 years at Kapalga
    (segment M) and one that had been burnt 2 years prior to sampling near Jabiru.
  original_file: schmidt data for RhysWhitleyJuly2012.xls, SuzanneIsoope.xls (two
    worksheets of data), TOTAL4 Kakadu data, wue_Schmidt data.xls, KAKADU1.xls (the
    data in it was cut and paste into the file now called KAKADU1_reformatted.csv),  are
    all incorporated into this file
  notes: This data set now combines the previous Kakadu data in Schmidt_2003 (old
    version; in archive folder) and data found in Suzanne Schmidt's original data
    submission. For the expanded data set, we only have species name abbreviations
    for some species. E. Wenk manually matched abbreviations with the Northern Territory
    species list if these was no ambiguity, but left others as abbreviations. Some
    of the d15N values (in both files) were clearly %C values - Lizzy Wenk has manually
    moved them to the %C column. For many species there were replicate measurements
    and the replicate that is assumed to be %C was much different than the other two
    values.

    notes: Ranger uranium mine is an open-cut mine, processing ore from up to about
      40 m depth. Mine spoil material was piled into waste rock dumps and two waste
      rock dumps were reforested with woodland species in 1987 and 1984 (referred
      to as WRD I and II, respectively). Acacia species represent the main woody species
      at both WRDs. The parent rock material was a loamy clayey chloritic weathered
      schist (WRD I) and a clayey highly weathered schist (WRD II).

    notes: The monsoon forests occur as isolated patches established in less fire-prone
      regions and are rarely burnt (Bowman 1992). Two monsoon forest communities were
      studied, a deciduous monsoon forest and a closed wet evergreen monsoon forest;
      the latter is provided with constant moisture by a permanent spring. The deciduous
      monsoon forest grew on a moderately drained clayey red soil close to the floodplain.
      Species at the deciduous monsoon forest site included perennial, deciduous,
      annual, and geophyte species. The evergreen monsoon forest grew on grey loamy
      soil and is seasonally flooded with running water. The vegetation consists mainly
      of perennial trees and a very sparse ground cover.

    notes: The lowland wetlands are treeless flood plains with trees along river channels,
      billabongs (waterholes) or swamps (Brock 1988). They are inundated during the
      wet season and support a comparatively low number of species dominated by members
      of the Cyperaceae and Poaceae, and a range of aquatic plants. For this study,
      two wetlands, one disturbed (near the Kakadu highway) and one un- disturbed
      (near Radon Spring), were sampled. The disturbed wet- land site was a clayey
      loam flooded with running fresh water during the wet season. This site was affected
      by wallowing and grazing of feral pigs and water buffaloes.

    notes: The most distinctive eucalypt community in Northern Australia is dominated
      by two species, Eucalyptus tetrodonta and E. miniata, which occur either singly
      or in combination (Brock 1988). The non- eucalypt understorey includes evergreen
      species as well as obligate and facultative deciduous species. There is a moderate
      vegetation cover with annual and perennial grasses, herbs, and vines during
      the wet season. Two natural eucalypt woodland sites, located near the Ranger
      uranium mine and at Kapalga, had not been subjected to are for 3-4 years prior
      to sampling. Soils are well-draining sandy loams or loams, and during the wet
      season both sites are temporarily flooded. Results obtained for the two locations
      were combined. Disturbed eucalypt woodlands included a site at Kapalga which
      had been burnt annually since 1990 (burnt woodland) in the late dry season.
      Another eucalypt woodland located near the Ranger uranium mine, which received
      irrigation with excess mine waste water in the wet season, was studied (irrigated
      eucalypt woodland). Waste water from the ore-leaching process was applied to
      the site in 1985, 1987, 1989, and 1991. During those five years the site received
      a substantial input of mineral elements, in particular sulfate (26,000 kg ha)1),
      magnesium (5500 kg ha)1), sodium (1600 kg ha)1) and calcium (1,100 kg ha)1).
      In contrast, the content of P and N (as NO3 ) in the waste water was low (Ashwath
      personal communication). MgSO4 salt crusts partly cover the soil surface and
      the water table is high (within 1 m). Some species have been dying as a result
      of either high salinity and/or high water table (N. Ashwath, personal communication).

      Species at the deciduous monsoon forest site included perennial, deciduous,
      annual, and geophyte species. The evergreen monsoon forest grew on grey loamy
      soil and is seasonally flooded with running water. The vegetation consists mainly
      of perennial trees and a very sparse ground cover.

    notes: The sandstone escarpment is a rocky terrain with vegetation established

      is open eucalypt woodland dominated by typical Australian families including
      Myrtaceae, Proteaceae and Mimosaceae with evergreen scleromorphous and often
      highly reduced foliage. The vegetation is characterised by a sparse canopy and
