  description: Banksia species dataset from WA
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: Glasshouse study in which study species (Banksia species) were
    grown in each of six soils. Each pot was planted with seeds collected from a different
    plant in a population.The plants were cultivated in a cooled glasshouse at the
    University of Western Australia, with light shade provided during the summer months,
    and were watered with deionized water.The minimum ambient temperature in the glasshouse
    was 17 deg C and the maximum was 32 deg C, and the average maximum light intensity
    was approximately 1000 mmol m-2 s-1 in summer and 500 mmol m-2 s-1 in winter.

  methods: Leaf area were measured using an Epson 1680 scanner (Epson America Inc.,
    Long Beach, CA,USA)and the Winrhizo (Regent Instruments, Quebec, Canada) analysis
    program. Dry mass of shoot parts and roots was determined after drying for 48

  methods: Seeds, shoots and roots were finely ground and subsamples were digested
    after digestion of ground material in hot concentrated HNO3:HClO4 (3:1) (Zarcinas,
    Cartwright&Spouncer 1987) and analysed for P, S, Ca, K, Mg, Fe, B, Mo,Mn, Zn,
    Ni and Na using a Varian Vista axial inductively coupled plasma atomic emission
    spectrometer. One-year-old, two-year-old and senesced leaves were sampled from
    field-grown plants in 2005. Leaf material was oven-dried at 70 deg C, ground using
    a ball mill, and P concentrations were estimated.

    Ni and Na using a Varian Vista axial inductively coupled plasma atomic emission
    spectrometer. For poly-P quantification, 20 mg finely ground seeds were extracted
    with 100 mL 1M H2SO4 and 230 mL 5M NaCl, and poly-P was purified and quantified
    as described previously (Werner, Amrhein & Freimoser 2005).

  methods: Seeds, shoots and roots were finely ground and subsamples were digested
    after digestion of ground material in hot concentrated HNO3:HClO4 (3:1) (Zarcinas,
    Cartwright&Spouncer 1987) and analysed for P, S, Ca, K, Mg, Fe, B, Mo,Mn, Zn,
    Ni and Na using a Varian Vista axial inductively coupled plasma atomic emission
    spectrometer.
