  description: various traits for savannah and forest species
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: The bark thickness of 43 tree species from 1020 individuals in
    tropical savanna, and 20 species from 281 individuals in monsoon forest, was sampled
    at Litchfield National Park (LNP; 1464 km2) in June 2009 and at East Point Reserve
    (135 ha) in August 2009, respectively.

  Litchfield:
    description: The vegetation in LNP is dominated by eucalypt open forests and woodlands,
      with a grassy understorey, referred to hereafter as tropical savanna. The seasonal
      climate is particularly conducive to high fire frequencies, the wet season is
      highly productive with abundant grass growth, while the 7-month dry season (c.
      May–November) strongly promotes grass curing and flammability. Fires are typically
      ground fires and are fuelled by native Sorghum spp. grasses. On average 66%
      of LNP is burnt per annum (Russell-Smith et al. 2009). Data from tropical savannas
      were collected from vegetation monitoring plots (20 m 9 40 m) that were established
      between March 1994 and August 1996 in LNP. These monitoring plot data indicate
      that 86% of fires in LNP are of low (2 m scorch height) or moderate (sub-canopy
      scorch) severity. We sampled only those plots that had been burnt at least in
      the previous dry season or more recently and had been burnt in at least five
      of the previous 12 years, that is an average fire return interval of c. 1.5
      years (Northern Territory Bushfires Council, unpublished data). Fire severity
      in the plots we surveyed was of low to moderate intensity.
  East Point Reserve:
    longitude (deg): 130.8333
    latitude (deg): -12.4083
    description: East Point Reserve (12°24′30″ S, 130°50′ E) is a regionally significant
      remnant of coastal monsoon forest (Panton 1993). The forest belongs to Group
      9 of Russell-Smith (1991) and is described as semideciduous rainforest and vine
      thicket. Monsoon forest on the East Point peninsula was extensively cleared
      and burnt from 1932 to 1963 (Franklin, Matthews & Lawes 2010), and we sampled
      only forest remnants that had not been previously cleared or burnt.

questions:
  contributor: The referenced manuscript does not contain  methods for the
    trait data submitted. Do you have brief descriptions of the methods used, including
    number of replicates measured? Also, do you have approximate latitude/longitude
    data for Litchfield National Park - a point within the park that data users can
    use as the focal location for the study.
  austraits: The referenced manuscript is about bark thickness, but
    data for this trait are not included in the data file.
