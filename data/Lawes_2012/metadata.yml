  description: various traits for savannah and forest species

  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: 'The bark thickness of 43 tree species from 1020 individuals
    in tropical savanna, and 20 species from 281 individuals in monsoon forest, was
    sampled at Litchfield National Park (LNP; 1464 km2) in June 2009 and at East Point
    Reserve (135 ha) in August 2009, respectively. The vegetation in LNP is dominated
    by eucalypt open forests and woodlands, with a grassy understorey, referred to
    hereafter as tropical savanna. The seasonal climate is particularly conducive
    to high fire frequencies: the wet season is highly productive with abundant grass
    growth, while the 7-month dry season (c. May-November) strongly promotes grass
    curing and flammability. Fires are typically ground fires and are fuelled by native
    Sorghum spp. grasses. On average 66% of LNP is burnt per annum (Russell-Smith
    et al. 2009). Data from tropical savannas were collected from vegetation monitoring
    plots (20 m 9 40 m) that were established between March 1994 and August 1996 in
    LNP. These monitoring plot data indicate that 86% of fires in LNP are of low (2
    m scorch height) or moderate (sub-canopy scorch) severity. We sampled only those
    plots that had been burnt at least in the previous dry season or more recently
    and had been burnt in at least five of the previous 12 years, that is an average
    fire return interval of c. 1.5 years (Northern Territory Bushfires Council, unpublished
    data). Fire severity in the plots we surveyed was of low to moderate intensity.
    East Point Reserve (12deg24min30sec S, 130deg50min E) is a regionally significant
    remnant of coastal monsoon forest (Panton 1993). The forest belongs to Group 9
    of Russell-Smith (1991) and is described as semideciduous rainforest and vine
    thicket. Monsoon forest on the East Point peninsula was extensively cleared and
    burnt from 1932 to 1963 (Franklin, Matthews & Lawes 2010), and we sampled nly
    forest remnants that had not been previously cleared or burnt.'

  methods: Bark thickness was measured using a standard thickness gauge (Haglof, Barktax,
    Sweden) or where bark was not penetrable using the gauge, we used a needle punch
    (diam. = 3 mm). In both cases, the gauge was inserted to the point of resistance
    by the sapwood. Bark thickness measured by this method includes the cambium in
    most instances, but as the cambium is thin (< 0.5 mm), this did not substantially
    affect measures of bark thickness. Where bark was fissured, we measured thickness
    from the highest point. We took three evenly spaced measures of bark thickness
    around the circumference of the stem at breast height (1.3 m) per individual.
    The diameter at breast height of each tree was also measured.
