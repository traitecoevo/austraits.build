  description: A study of the effect of past fire history on fire severity and the
    proportion of plants that resprout following a natural fire.

  sampling_strategy: 'Study sites: Fire-boundary maps for the January 2013 Giblin
    River Fire and the April 2011 Gunfight Creek management burn, based on aerial
    surveys, were obtained from Tasmanian Department of Primary Industries, Parks,
    Water and Environment. Two study sites with differing fire histories were selected
    within the Giblin River fire scar (Fig. 3). These were Davey Gorge (henceforth,
    ''''Davey''''), which was previously unburnt since the major fire of 1934 (79
    years since fire), and the Lost World Plateau (henceforth, ''''Lost World''''),
    which had been burnt in the 1934 and again in 1976 (37 years since fire). A third
    study site was located at Gunfight Creek (henceforth, ''''Gunfight''''), near
    the Davey and Lost World sites and at the boundary of the Giblin River fire. The
    Gunfight area was burnt by a management fire in 2011, and only a small area burnt
    by the management fire was burnt again by the 2013 wildfire (Marsden-Smedley 2014;
    Fig. 3). Prior to the management burn, the Gunfight area had been burnt by wildfires
    in 1934 and 1976 (35-year fire-free interval to 2011). At all three sites, we
    surveyed vegetation in long-unburnt (>30 years) and recently burnt (i.e. since
    2010; determined visually in the field) areas. At Gunfight, we also placed ''''double-burnt''''
    transects in the small area burnt by both the 2011 management burn and the 2013
    wildfire. Some unburnt vegetation surveyed at Lost World was located directly
    outside the Giblin River fire boundary, but all other unburnt vegetation surveyed
    was in unburnt patches that had escaped being burnt. All sites were on low-fertility
    substrates as defined by Marsden-Smedley et al. (1999), to control for the influence
    of geology on fuel loading and species composition. Fire radiative-power and fire-danger
    indices MODIS hotspot data for the fire were downloaded from the MODIS website.
    Values of fire radiative power (FRP), a proxy for fire intensity, were obtained
    from the MODIS active fire products MOD14 and MYD14 (Giglio et al. 2003; Williamson
    et al. 2013). This showed that FRP near the Davey and Lost World sites averaged
    362MW (Fig. 3), but no MODIS hotspots were detected during the management burn
    at Gunfight, because of low fire intensity combined with cloud cover. Maximum
    daily McArthurs forest fire-danger index (FFDI; Dowdy et al. 2009) was calculated
    for the days of the fires, using data from the Bureau of Meteorology stations
    nearest the fire (Port Davey and Scotts Peak Dam). These showed that maximum daily
    FFDI was 40 on the day Davey and Lost World burnt (and 10 on the following day),
    compared with 3 during the management burn at Gunfight. Thus, the fire-danger
    rating was ''''very high'''' during the 2013 wildfire, and ''''low'''' during
    the management burn (Dowdy et al. 2009). The Moorland fire-danger rating (MFDR),
    specifically developed for this vegetation type, was also calculated (Marsden-Smedley
    et al. 1999). On the day Davey and Lost World burnt, the MFDR peaked at 81 (very
    high), and reached 39 (high) on the following day (Fig. S1, available as Supplementary
    material to this paper). By comparison, during the Gunfight management burn, the
    maximum daily MFDR value was 20 (moderate), and the average was 6 (low). Field
    survey: Physical and biological data were collected from a total of 231 transects
    (Fig. 3), listed according to site and fire history in Table 1. All transects
    were located in vegetation that contained Gymnoschoenus sphaerocephalus (buttongrass)
    and had a shrub canopy less than 1.5m in height. The most abundant shrub taxa
    in the study transects were Sprengelia incarnata, Melaleuca squamea, Melaleuca
    squarrosa, Leptospermum nitidum, Boronia spp., Baekia leptocaulis, Hakea epiglottis,
    Epacris spp., Agastachys odorata, Dillwynia glaberrima, Allocasuarina zephyrea
    and Banksia marginata (Table 2), as well as the scrambling shrub Bauera rubioides.
    Transects were positioned to representatively sample topographic heterogeneity
    and the full range of aspects within sites. After a topographic position was chosen,
    a steel probe was blindly thrown to mark the starting point of each transect.
    From this point, a 1-m-wide and 10-m-long transect was marked out parallel to
    the topographic contours. The geographic coordinates of the starting point were
    obtained using a handheld GPS device. Biological variables: Along each transect,
    five observation points (at 0m, 2.5 m, 5m, 7.5m and 10 m) were used to collect
    biological data relating to biomass (namely shrub density, height, basal diameter),
    fire impact (minimum twig diameter, presence of live or dead leaves and whether
    the plant was dead or alive) and regeneration response (resprout and seedling
    densities). The scrambling shrub Bauera rubioides was excluded from these observations
    because of its very small size relative to the other shrubs in the region. In
    all burnt transects, the first five woody stems encountered moving from an observation
    point towards the end of the transect were recorded as either dead (if there was
    no living tissue evident on the original woody stem, no basal resprouts and no
    epicormic resprouting) or alive (if they had green foliage, or live resprouts).
    We, thus, refer to dead main stems (with or without resprouting) and to dead whole
    plants (with no resprouting). Stems were identified to species level where possible,
    and, otherwise, to a species group. The diameter of the smallest dead twig present
    on each original stem was recorded to the nearest half millimetre as a proxy for
    fire severity (Moreno and Oechel 1989; Keeley 2009). The basal diameter of the
    first five woody stems (dead or alive) encountered moving from each observation
    point toward the end of the transect was recorded and used to calculate the basal
    area of each stem. The length of transect from each starting point to the fifth
    stem was recorded, lengths were pooled within a transect and multiplied by the
    transect width to give the ground area surveyed. The combined basal area of all
    25 woody stems was divided by the area surveyed to give woody basal area, as a
    proxy for woody biomass.'

    soil description: Soils are characterised by an organic layer, typically 20-40
      cm deep (Brown 2005; Wood et al. 2011) that is underlain by mineral soils, bedrock
      or quartz gravels. The soils are highly acidic (pH 4.1-4.5) and most of their
      small nutrient capital is derived from cyclic salts (Bowman et al. 1986; Brown
      2005).
