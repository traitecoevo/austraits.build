  description: Study investigating phosphate limitations to photosynthetic capacity
    in field grown plants.
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: The research was conducted on trees and shrubs growing at five
    different sites in eastern and south-western Australia (Table 1), with different
    soil substrates and parent materials resulting in different leaf P contents in
    their characteristic species. Sites were chosen based upon known aspects of their
    mineralogy and previous studies on leaf nutrients (e.g., Lambers et al. 2012)
    so that they would provide a range in leaf total P and Pi fraction and thus presumably
    represent a range in Pi limitations to Anet. Four of the five sites were infertile
    and low in P availability, with the fifth site on a richer soil. The Davies Park
    site is located at 390 m above sea level (a.s.l.) in the Blue Mountains in eastern
    Australia on thin soils overlaying Hawkesbury sandstone, a Triassic sedimentary
    quartzose sandstone formed over 200 Mya. The soils derived from the Hawkesbury
    sandstone in the Blue Mountains are shallow (5-20 cm depth) and very infertile
    with low P availability. The Hawkesbury Forest Experiment and adjacent Hawkesbury
    campus and EucFACE sites are all located at 30 m a.s.l. within 1 km of one another
    on Clarendon loamy sand, a deep, alluvial soil formed in the late Pleistocene
    by meanders of the Hawkesbury river around 1.5 Mya. The soil is a low-fertility
    loamy sand, with soil surface total P concentrations of 60 mg kg-1 soil in the
    upper 15 cm (Ellsworth et al., unpubl. data), but a large fraction of this P is
    sorbed onto aluminosilicates and ferro-manganesian silicates (Holford 1997). One
    of the plantations at this site (L. styraciflua L.) was horticulturally managed
    and had periodically amended soil P. The Lesueur National Park site is described
    in detail in Lambers et al. (2012). This site is located near Jurien Bay, WA,
    and occurs at 80 m a.s.l. on shallow colluvial sand and lateritic gravel over
    weathered sandstone from the late Jurassic Yarragadee Formation (150-185 million
    years old; Griffin & Burbidge 1990). The sandy soil at this site is extremely
    low in P, with a total P of 9.5 mg kg-1 soil in the upper 30 cm (Lambers et al.
    2012). The fifth site, Illawarra Fly in Robertson, NSW, is a fertile site on young
    soils. This site occurs at 710 m a.s.l. elevation on soils of the Illawarra escarpment
    that are brown clay loams underlain by Paleocene/Pliocene basalt. These basaltic
    soils in the area are relatively fertile with total P of 1010 mg kg-1 soil and
    frequently managed for farming, although this particular site was in a never-farmed
    parcel of mature remnant wet sclerophyll forest. Since sites differed in elevation,
    amounts of gases such as CO2 and O2 are reported as partial pressures (e.g., pO2)
    rather than mole fractions. ^p While the focus was on measuring species of Eucalyptus
    as native dominants in the study regions, non-Myrtaceous species were also included
    (Banksia spp. and Persoonia levis, all Proteaceae, and Acacia oblongifolia). An
    exotic deciduous plantation tree, L. styraciflua, was also included in the study
    so that inferences would not be strictly limited to native Australian sclerophyll
    species, which are considered to be well adapted to low soil P (Beadle 1966).

  methods: In this study, photosynthetic CO2-response curves (Anet-Ci response curves)
    were made in situ on 10 species of trees and shrubs at five sites in Australia
    (Table 1) using a portable photosynthesis system (Li-Cor 6400XT; Li-Cor Inc.,
    Lincoln, NE, USA) with a 6 cm2 chamber. All measurements were made on attached,
    intact leaves at the top of the crown or the outer shell of the crown when open-grown,
    which meant accessing leaves from 1 m up to 25 m high (Table 1). For tall species,
    access to the upper parts of the tree crowns was achieved by three different means,
    an articulated boom lift (Snorkel MHP13/35 Trailer Mounted Lift; Snorkel Ltd.,
    Meadowbrook, Qld, Australia) used at the Hawkesbury site in Richmond, NSW; a set
    of 36 m tall construction cranes (Jaso crane J-4010; Jaso S.L., Idiazabal, Spain)
    at the nearby EucFACE site in Richmond, NSW; and a custom-built steel-alloy canopy
    walkway going up from ground level to 30 m height ('Illawarra fly') at Robertson,
    NSW. Canopy access was not necessary at the Lesueur National Park site or at Davies
    Park, as trees and shrubs were open-grown in each of the sclerophyll woodlands,
    and unshaded leaves at the outside of the crown could be readily measured. ^p
    We made field measurements of the instantaneous response of leaf net CO2 assimilation
    to changes in the external CO2 concentration according to Ellsworth et al. (2004)
    using standard coefficients recommended in Sharkey et al. (2007) when fitting
    the FvCB model (see below). Anet-Cc response measurements on all species were
    made during the growing season in summer and autumn at seasonal temperatures and
    during periods of recent rainfall to reduce complications due to drought. Previous-year's
    leaves were measured rather than newly emerged leaves to ensure that leaves were
    operating at their full photosynthetic capacity (see Denton et al. 2007; Lambers
    et al. 2012). The Anet measurements were made in morning hours on sunny days so
    as to avoid stomatal closure and midday depression of Anet.^p The Anet-Cc response
    curves were started by maintaining the CO2 concentration (Ca) in the gas exchange
    chamber at ambient CO2 partial pressure (~38-39 Pa in this study) until gas exchange
    rates were stable and then recording measurements. Steps for the curves were generated
    by decreasing Ca to near the compensation point (5 Pa) and then increasing Ca
    stepwise across 8-9 steps (Ellsworth et al. 2012) at a constant photosynthetic
    photon flux density of 1800 umol m-2 s-1, 50-70% relative humidity and a controlled
    leaf temperature (between 26 and 28 °C, depending upon the species). The mean
    leaf-air vapour pressure deficit of the measurements was 1.5 ± 0.1 kPa. At each
    Ca step, we recorded Anet, gs, Ci and associated variables when stability was
    reached. Upon completion of measurements, leaves were placed on ice or liquid
    nitrogen until ready for further analysis. In the laboratory, leaf thickness was
    measured at five points on the leaf lamina using digital callipers (Mitutoyo Corp,
    Kawasaki, Kanagawa, Japan). ^p In the process of these Anet-Cc response measurements,
    at four or five of the Ca steps, we ensured that parallel measurements at ambient
    oxygen (21 kPa) and low-photorespiratory oxygen (2 kPa) were made. Low pO2 inside
    the gas exchange chamber was generated by routing a low-O2 tank gas (Air Liquide
    Australia Ltd., Melbourne, Australia) to the leaf chamber, supplied at the same
    slight over-pressure as for ambient air as described by Li-Cor (Li-Cor 2008) and
    with the excess flow to the Li-6400 pump monitored with a rotameter. A Teflon
    T-valve was toggled between ambient air with 21 kPa pO2 and 2 kPa tank gas at
    the appropriate Ca steps (up to five Ca steps including at saturation). These
    steps were chosen in order to minimally define the initial rise to a maximum and
    the maximum asymptote for the Anet-Cc curve at low pO2, given that the shape of
    these curves has long been known (Laing et al. 1974; von Caemmerer 2000). The
    flow excess was maintained around 0.3 L min-1. Measurements of Anet in 2 kPa pO2
    were completely reversible as described in Laing et al. (1974) (see Supporting
    Information Fig. S1).

    using standard coefficients recommended in Sharkey et al. (2007) when fitting
    the FvCB model (see below). Anet-Cc response measurements on all species were
    made during the growing season in summer and autumn at seasonal temperatures and
    during periods of recent rainfall to reduce complications due to drought. Previous-year's
    leaves were measured rather than newly emerged leaves to ensure that leaves were
    operating at their full photosynthetic capacity (see Denton et al. 2007; Lambers
    et al. 2012). The Anet measurements were made in morning hours on sunny days so
    as to avoid stomatal closure and midday depression of Anet.^p The Anet-Cc response
    curves were started by maintaining the CO2 concentration (Ca) in the gas exchange
    chamber at ambient CO2 partial pressure (~38-39 Pa in this study) until gas exchange
    rates were stable and then recording measurements. Steps for the curves were generated
    by decreasing Ca to near the compensation point (5 Pa) and then increasing Ca
    stepwise across 8-9 steps (Ellsworth et al. 2012) at a constant photosynthetic
    photon flux density of 1800 umol m-2 s-1, 50-70% relative humidity and a controlled
    leaf temperature (between 26 and 28 °C, depending upon the species). The mean
    leaf-air vapour pressure deficit of the measurements was 1.5 ± 0.1 kPa. At each
    Ca step, we recorded Anet, gs, Ci and associated variables when stability was
    reached. Upon completion of measurements, leaves were placed on ice or liquid
    nitrogen until ready for further analysis. In the laboratory, leaf thickness was
    measured at five points on the leaf lamina using digital callipers (Mitutoyo Corp,
    Kawasaki, Kanagawa, Japan). ^p In the process of these Anet-Cc response measurements,
    at four or five of the Ca steps, we ensured that parallel measurements at ambient
    oxygen (21 kPa) and low-photorespiratory oxygen (2 kPa) were made. Low pO2 inside
    the gas exchange chamber was generated by routing a low-O2 tank gas (Air Liquide
    Australia Ltd., Melbourne, Australia) to the leaf chamber, supplied at the same
    slight over-pressure as for ambient air as described by Li-Cor (Li-Cor 2008) and
    with the excess flow to the Li-6400 pump monitored with a rotameter. A Teflon
    T-valve was toggled between ambient air with 21 kPa pO2 and 2 kPa tank gas at
    the appropriate Ca steps (up to five Ca steps including at saturation). These
    steps were chosen in order to minimally define the initial rise to a maximum and
    the maximum asymptote for the Anet-Cc curve at low pO2, given that the shape of
    these curves has long been known (Laing et al. 1974; von Caemmerer 2000). The
    flow excess was maintained around 0.3 L min-1. Measurements of Anet in 2 kPa pO2
    were completely reversible as described in Laing et al. (1974) (see Supporting
    Information Fig. S1).

    were completely reversible as described in Laing et al. (1974) (see Supporting
    Information Fig. S1). ^p We used three corrections for changes in pO2 in the carrier
    gas in the Li-6400XT photosynthesis system that originated from the change in
    density due to different gas concentrations. The corrections employed were (1)
    increased air flow rate through the CO2 injector system due to reduced air viscosity
    with decreased pO2; (2) band broadening of CO2 infrared absorption (Burch et al.
    1962) incorporated into the standard Li-6400 software; and (3) band broadening
    of water vapour infrared absorption (Bunce 2002). ^p Given theoretical issues
    raised by Gu & Sun (2014) concerning the dependence of mesophyll conductance to
    CO2 (gm) on Ci, we assumed a constant gm for different Ci steps in the response
    curve data. Mesophyll conductance was either measured or estimated for each species
    for calculations of Cc. For three species among those in Table 1 ranging in Anet
    from highest and lowest, we measured instantaneous gm with online carbon isotope
    discrimination using tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy (TDLAS) (Campbell
    Scientific TGA100A; Logan, UT, USA). Our gm calculations follow Tazoe et al. (2011),
    with further description in Crous et al. (2013). We then estimated mean gm of
    all the species using a relationship for gm as a function of gs from our measurements
    (gm = -0.04 + 1.34*gs, r2 = 0.54; Supporting Information Fig. S2). In a review
    of available data, gm usually scaled with gs especially among well-watered plants
    (Flexas et al. 2012). After incorporating gm, we derived biochemical model parameters
    using the Anet-Cc data. ^p Photosynthetic parameter fits were carried out by R
    Core Development Team (2014) using kinetic coefficients in Sharkey et al. (2007)
    to standardize the fits across species, but using r* (the photosynthetic CO2 compensation
    point) and its temperature dependence specifically measured for Eucalyptus (Crous
    et al. 2013). We fit Vcmax, Jmax and Tp piecewise using specified ranges of conditions
    where each parameter was judged to limit Anet following guidelines in Sharkey
    et al. (2007) with the nonlinear solutions generated using the 'optim' package
    in R. Tp was fit for Anet when Cc > 40 Pa and pO2 of 2 kPa. As a more robust fitting
    approach with fewer assumptions, we also pooled data for all leaves within a species
    and simultaneously solved for species level Vcmax, Jmax and Tp at both pO2 levels
    using the 'nls' package in R. Across species, the two sets of solutions agreed
    well with one another, since slopes for each parameter were close to unity (slopes
    of 0.981, 0.966 and 0.840 for Vcmax, Jmax and Tp, respectively, estimated for
    piecewise compared with simultaneously solved). Vomax, the maximum velocity of
    oxygenase activity, was fited to the data from both pO2 levels for low Cc where
    oxygenase activity of Rubisco is considered limiting, following equations in Farquhar
    et al. (1980).

    of the tree crowns was achieved by three different means, an articulated boom
    lift (Snorkel MHP13/35 Trailer Mounted Lift; Snorkel Ltd., Meadowbrook, Qld, Australia)

    cranes (Jaso crane J-4010; Jaso S.L., Idiazabal, Spain) at the nearby EucFACE
    site in Richmond, NSW; and a custom-built steel-alloy canopy walkway going up
    from ground level to 30 m height ('Illawarra fly') at Robertson, NSW. Canopy access
    was not necessary at the Lesueur National Park site or at Davies Park, as trees
    and shrubs were open-grown in each of the sclerophyll woodlands, and unshaded
    leaves at the outside of the crown could be readily measured. ^p After gas exchange
    measurements, leaves were immediately placed on ice and transported to the laboratory,
    where thickness and area were measured on a subsample, whereas the remainder was
    frozen and subsequently dried to a constant mass at 70°C. The leaf lamina dry
    mass per unit area (Ma) was calculated from the ratio of dry mass to fresh area.
    The dried sample was ground finely in a ball mill and used for analyses of total
    N concentration, total P concentration, inorganic P (Pi) concentration, and starch
    and soluble sugar concentrations. Leaf N concentration was analysed by elemental
    analysis after combustion using a CHN elemental analyser (TruSpec micro; LECO
    Corp., St. Joseph, MI, USA; or FLASH EA 1112 Series CHN analyser; Thermo-Finnigan,
    Waltham, MA, USA). Leaf total P concentrations were measured after digesting dried
    leaf tissue with concentrated sulfuric acid (H2SO4) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)
    in a microwave digester apparatus (Berghof speedwave four; Berghof Products GmbH,
    Eningen, Germany). The solutions containing total P or the Pi fraction were analysed
    colorimetrically at 880nm (AQ2; SEAL Analytical, Ltd., Milwaukee, WI, USA) after
    a standard molybdate reaction (Close & Beadle 2004). Analyses of N and P concentrations
    used international standards run blind alongside the samples and are expressed
    as N and P content (mmol m-2) in this manuscript due to differences in leaf thickness
    among the species (Table1). Bulk leaf Pi was determined by extracting samples
    in 0.3M trichloroacetic acid at 4°C before cold centrifuging at 9224xg (10000r.p.m.)
    for 5min and collecting the filtrate (Close & Beadle 2004). The Pi concentrations
    in the samples were determined against standards made with KH2PO4 in serial dilution.

    (Table 1) using a portable photosynthesis system (Li-Cor 6400XT; Li-Cor Inc.,
    Lincoln, NE, USA) with a 6 cm2 chamber. All measurements were made on attached,

    We made field measurements of the instantaneous response of leaf net CO2 assimilation
    to changes in the external CO2 concentration according to Ellsworth et al. (2004)
    using standard coefficients recommended in Sharkey et al. (2007) when fitting
    the FvCB model (see below). Anet-Cc response measurements on all species were
    made during the growing season in summer and autumn at seasonal temperatures and
    during periods of recent rainfall to reduce complications due to drought. Previous-year's
    leaves were measured rather than newly emerged leaves to ensure that leaves were
    operating at their full photosynthetic capacity (see Denton et al. 2007; Lambers
    et al. 2012). The Anet measurements were made in morning hours on sunny days so
    as to avoid stomatal closure and midday depression of Anet.^p The Anet-Cc response
    curves were started by maintaining the CO2 concentration (Ca) in the gas exchange
    chamber at ambient CO2 partial pressure (~38-39 Pa in this study) until gas exchange
    rates were stable and then recording measurements. Steps for the curves were generated
    by decreasing Ca to near the compensation point (5 Pa) and then increasing Ca
    stepwise across 8-9 steps (Ellsworth et al. 2012) at a constant photosynthetic
    photon flux density of 1800 umol m-2 s-1, 50-70% relative humidity and a controlled
    leaf temperature (between 26 and 28 °C, depending upon the species). The mean
    leaf-air vapour pressure deficit of the measurements was 1.5 ± 0.1 kPa. At each
    Ca step, we recorded Anet, gs, Ci and associated variables when stability was
    reached. Upon completion of measurements, leaves were placed on ice or liquid
    nitrogen until ready for further analysis. In the laboratory, leaf thickness was
    measured at five points on the leaf lamina using digital callipers (Mitutoyo Corp,
    Kawasaki, Kanagawa, Japan). ^p In the process of these Anet-Cc response measurements,
    at four or five of the Ca steps, we ensured that parallel measurements at ambient
    oxygen (21 kPa) and low-photorespiratory oxygen (2 kPa) were made. Low pO2 inside
    the gas exchange chamber was generated by routing a low-O2 tank gas (Air Liquide
    Australia Ltd., Melbourne, Australia) to the leaf chamber, supplied at the same
    slight over-pressure as for ambient air as described by Li-Cor (Li-Cor 2008) and
    with the excess flow to the Li-6400 pump monitored with a rotameter. A Teflon
    T-valve was toggled between ambient air with 21 kPa pO2 and 2 kPa tank gas at
    the appropriate Ca steps (up to five Ca steps including at saturation). These
    steps were chosen in order to minimally define the initial rise to a maximum and
    the maximum asymptote for the Anet-Cc curve at low pO2, given that the shape of
    these curves has long been known (Laing et al. 1974; von Caemmerer 2000). The
    flow excess was maintained around 0.3 L min-1. Measurements of Anet in 2 kPa pO2
    were completely reversible as described in Laing et al. (1974) (see Supporting
    Information Fig. S1).

    were completely reversible as described in Laing et al. (1974) (see Supporting
    Information Fig. S1). ^p We used three corrections for changes in pO2 in the carrier
    gas in the Li-6400XT photosynthesis system that originated from the change in
    density due to different gas concentrations. The corrections employed were (1)
    increased air flow rate through the CO2 injector system due to reduced air viscosity
    with decreased pO2; (2) band broadening of CO2 infrared absorption (Burch et al.
    1962) incorporated into the standard Li-6400 software; and (3) band broadening
    of water vapour infrared absorption (Bunce 2002). ^p Given theoretical issues
    raised by Gu & Sun (2014) concerning the dependence of mesophyll conductance to
    CO2 (gm) on Ci, we assumed a constant gm for different Ci steps in the response
    curve data. Mesophyll conductance was either measured or estimated for each species
    for calculations of Cc. For three species among those in Table 1 ranging in Anet
    from highest and lowest, we measured instantaneous gm with online carbon isotope
    discrimination using tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy (TDLAS) (Campbell
    Scientific TGA100A; Logan, UT, USA). Our gm calculations follow Tazoe et al. (2011),
    with further description in Crous et al. (2013). We then estimated mean gm of
    all the species using a relationship for gm as a function of gs from our measurements
    (gm = -0.04 + 1.34*gs, r2 = 0.54; Supporting Information Fig. S2). In a review
    of available data, gm usually scaled with gs especially among well-watered plants
    (Flexas et al. 2012). After incorporating gm, we derived biochemical model parameters
    using the Anet-Cc data. ^p Photosynthetic parameter fits were carried out by R
    Core Development Team (2014) using kinetic coefficients in Sharkey et al. (2007)
    to standardize the fits across species, but using r* (the photosynthetic CO2 compensation
    point) and its temperature dependence specifically measured for Eucalyptus (Crous
    et al. 2013). We fit Vcmax, Jmax and Tp piecewise using specified ranges of conditions
    where each parameter was judged to limit Anet following guidelines in Sharkey
    et al. (2007) with the nonlinear solutions generated using the 'optim' package
    in R. Tp was fit for Anet when Cc > 40 Pa and pO2 of 2 kPa. As a more robust fitting
    approach with fewer assumptions, we also pooled data for all leaves within a species
    and simultaneously solved for species level Vcmax, Jmax and Tp at both pO2 levels
    using the 'nls' package in R. Across species, the two sets of solutions agreed
    well with one another, since slopes for each parameter were close to unity (slopes
    of 0.981, 0.966 and 0.840 for Vcmax, Jmax and Tp, respectively, estimated for
    piecewise compared with simultaneously solved). Vomax, the maximum velocity of
    oxygenase activity, was fited to the data from both pO2 levels for low Cc where
    oxygenase activity of Rubisco is considered limiting, following equations in Farquhar
    et al. (1980).

    discrimination using tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy (TDLAS) (Campbell
    Scientific TGA100A; Logan, UT, USA). Our gm calculations follow Tazoe et al. (2011),
    with further description in Crous et al. (2013). We then estimated mean gm of
    all the species using a relationship for gm as a function of gs from our measurements
    (gm = -0.04 + 1.34*gs, r2 = 0.54; Supporting Information Fig. S2). In a review
    of available data, gm usually scaled with gs especially among well-watered plants
    (Flexas et al. 2012). After incorporating gm, we derived biochemical model parameters
    using the Anet-Cc data. ^p Photosynthetic parameter fits were carried out by R
    Core Development Team (2014) using kinetic coefficients in Sharkey et al. (2007)
    to standardize the fits across species, but using r* (the photosynthetic CO2 compensation
    point) and its temperature dependence specifically measured for Eucalyptus (Crous
    et al. 2013). We fit Vcmax, Jmax and Tp piecewise using specified ranges of conditions
    where each parameter was judged to limit Anet following guidelines in Sharkey
    et al. (2007) with the nonlinear solutions generated using the 'optim' package
    in R. Tp was fit for Anet when Cc > 40 Pa and pO2 of 2 kPa. As a more robust fitting
    approach with fewer assumptions, we also pooled data for all leaves within a species
    and simultaneously solved for species level Vcmax, Jmax and Tp at both pO2 levels
    using the 'nls' package in R. Across species, the two sets of solutions agreed
    well with one another, since slopes for each parameter were close to unity (slopes
    of 0.981, 0.966 and 0.840 for Vcmax, Jmax and Tp, respectively, estimated for
    piecewise compared with simultaneously solved). Vomax, the maximum velocity of
    oxygenase activity, was fited to the data from both pO2 levels for low Cc where
    oxygenase activity of Rubisco is considered limiting, following equations in Farquhar
    et al. (1980).

  methods: In this study, photosynthetic CO2-response curves (Anet-Ci response curves)
    were made in situ on 10 species of trees and shrubs at five sites in Australia
    (Table 1) using a portable photosynthesis system (Li-Cor 6400XT; Li-Cor Inc.,
    Lincoln, NE, USA) with a 6 cm2 chamber. All measurements were made on attached,
    intact leaves at the top of the crown or the outer shell of the crown when open-grown,
    which meant accessing leaves from 1 m up to 25 m high (Table 1). For tall species,
    access to the upper parts of the tree crowns was achieved by three different means,
    an articulated boom lift (Snorkel MHP13/35 Trailer Mounted Lift; Snorkel Ltd.,
    Meadowbrook, Qld, Australia) used at the Hawkesbury site in Richmond, NSW; a set
    of 36 m tall construction cranes (Jaso crane J-4010; Jaso S.L., Idiazabal, Spain)
    at the nearby EucFACE site in Richmond, NSW; and a custom-built steel-alloy canopy
    walkway going up from ground level to 30 m height ('Illawarra fly') at Robertson,
    NSW. Canopy access was not necessary at the Lesueur National Park site or at Davies
    Park, as trees and shrubs were open-grown in each of the sclerophyll woodlands,
    and unshaded leaves at the outside of the crown could be readily measured. ^p
    We made field measurements of the instantaneous response of leaf net CO2 assimilation
    to changes in the external CO2 concentration according to Ellsworth et al. (2004)
    using standard coefficients recommended in Sharkey et al. (2007) when fitting
    the FvCB model (see below). Anet-Cc response measurements on all species were
    made during the growing season in summer and autumn at seasonal temperatures and
    during periods of recent rainfall to reduce complications due to drought. Previous-year's
    leaves were measured rather than newly emerged leaves to ensure that leaves were
    operating at their full photosynthetic capacity (see Denton et al. 2007; Lambers
    et al. 2012). The Anet measurements were made in morning hours on sunny days so
    as to avoid stomatal closure and midday depression of Anet.^p The Anet-Cc response
    curves were started by maintaining the CO2 concentration (Ca) in the gas exchange
    chamber at ambient CO2 partial pressure (~38-39 Pa in this study) until gas exchange
    rates were stable and then recording measurements. Steps for the curves were generated
    by decreasing Ca to near the compensation point (5 Pa) and then increasing Ca
    stepwise across 8-9 steps (Ellsworth et al. 2012) at a constant photosynthetic
    photon flux density of 1800 umol m-2 s-1, 50-70% relative humidity and a controlled
    leaf temperature (between 26 and 28 °C, depending upon the species). The mean
    leaf-air vapour pressure deficit of the measurements was 1.5 ± 0.1 kPa. At each
    Ca step, we recorded Anet, gs, Ci and associated variables when stability was
    reached. Upon completion of measurements, leaves were placed on ice or liquid
    nitrogen until ready for further analysis. In the laboratory, leaf thickness was
    measured at five points on the leaf lamina using digital callipers (Mitutoyo Corp,
    Kawasaki, Kanagawa, Japan). ^p In the process of these Anet-Cc response measurements,
    at four or five of the Ca steps, we ensured that parallel measurements at ambient
    oxygen (21 kPa) and low-photorespiratory oxygen (2 kPa) were made. Low pO2 inside
    the gas exchange chamber was generated by routing a low-O2 tank gas (Air Liquide
    Australia Ltd., Melbourne, Australia) to the leaf chamber, supplied at the same
    slight over-pressure as for ambient air as described by Li-Cor (Li-Cor 2008) and
    with the excess flow to the Li-6400 pump monitored with a rotameter. A Teflon
    T-valve was toggled between ambient air with 21 kPa pO2 and 2 kPa tank gas at
    the appropriate Ca steps (up to five Ca steps including at saturation). These
    steps were chosen in order to minimally define the initial rise to a maximum and
    the maximum asymptote for the Anet-Cc curve at low pO2, given that the shape of
    these curves has long been known (Laing et al. 1974; von Caemmerer 2000). The
    flow excess was maintained around 0.3 L min-1. Measurements of Anet in 2 kPa pO2
    were completely reversible as described in Laing et al. (1974) (see Supporting
    Information Fig. S1).
