The dataset provided contains the gas exchange parameters in standard Li-Cor 6400 format, along with leaf chemistry (total N concentration, total P concentration, and inorganic P fraction) for mature trees of 11 species at five sites in NSW and WA. All measurements were made at or near the top of the canopy (accessed by crane, vertical lift, or canopy walkway for Eucalyptus species) or for open-grown individuals for those plants in WA, or for open-woodland grown plants in sclerophyll woodland for Davies Park, Blue Mountains, NSW. The measurements are for fully mature leaves (not expanding or recently-expanded leaves) on mature individuals.

Sites Hawkesbury Forest Experiment and Hawkesbury campus are plantations. Sites Lesueur National Park, Illawarra Fly, EucFACE_Richmond and Davies Park Reserve are native woodlands/forests that are undisturbed natural areas. EucFACE_Richmond trees were not part of the elevated CO2 experiment at EucFACE so they are grown under ambient CO2 like all the other woody plants here.
