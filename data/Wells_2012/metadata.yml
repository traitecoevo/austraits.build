  description: This research combines studies of plant phylogeny, trait inter-relations
    and seed dispersal, as a basis for understanding processes of natural regeneration
    in intact rainforests and secondary rainforests on abandoned pastures. It identifies
    four key dimensions of ecological variation among rainforest plants, each represented
    by a spectrum of correlated traits of plant life-history and ecophysiology, and
    highlights the importance of seed dispersal in shaping the distribution and ecological
    diversity of regeneration in secondary rainforests in Australia's Wet Tropics.
  basis_of_record: field
  sampling_strategy: Field studies of the spatial distributions of species and plant
    functional traits were located in Brooks Valley, Mungalli, on the south-eastern
    edge of Atherton Tablelands. Plants of all species, from 4th-leaf seedlings to
    adults, were surveyed on three transects extending from primary rainforest into
    the adjacent secondary rainforest area. Trait data were obtained from field measurements
    of seedlings and adults of each species for seedling light environments, leaf
    traits and stem density, and collated from published and unpublished literature
    sources for all other traits, except seed dispersal which was assigned from analysis
    of the CSIRO Fruit-Frugivore Interactions database (Dennis and Westcott, 2006).
    The complete dataset consists of leaf and/or stem samples from 1840 plants of
    183 species. Samples were taken from 3 - 13 seedlings and/or 3-24 adult plants
    per species. Seedlings were selected as healthy plants from 8 - 40cm in height,
    with no signs of stem damage, in the upper range of light environments for seedlings
    of that species. Adults were healthy plants above the minimum size and illumination
    for reproduction for a given species.   ^p   Sites   ^p   Plants were sampled
    in Brooks Valley, Mungalli, or similar sites in the south-eastern Atherton Tablelands,
    between June and October 2004. (Six adult leaf samples were from more distant
    sites, in the Daintree.) Latitude and Longitude is given for each site in the
    traits database. The principal sampling site, Brooks Valley, Mungalli, is an area
    at the south-eastern edge of the Atherton Tablelands at 390 m altitude (range
    382-394 m). The area receives high rainfall of >4000 mm per annum with only rare
    occurrences of a month with rainfall <100 mm during the cool season (May to October).
    The valley has has moderately-fertile basalt soils of the Maalan association,
    developed on old, very strongly weathered basaltic lava flows, with some influence
    of the underlying granite parent material (Laffan, 1988). Soil cores taken for
    this study at 16 sampling locations yielded estimates of macronutrients and cations
    within the mid to upper ranges of values for basalt soils on the Atherton Tablelands
    (Spain 1990). The valley was formerly covered in 'Complex Mesophyll Vine Forest'
    CMVF Type 1b with some areas of Mesophyll Vine Forest MVF 2a (Tracey, 1982). The
    area of secondary rainforest had regenerated (without management) over 50 years
    since the abandonment of moderately grazed dairy pastures, and the immediately
    adjacent primary forest is of CMVF Type 1b.

  methods: Seed mass is here defined as the oven-dry mass of the seed including any
    tissues strongly attached to the embryo or endosperm (e.g. testa, endocarp), but
    excluding any flesh or dispersal appendages. Seed dry mass values (mg) were obtained
    for all 207 species (199 angiosperms, 1 cycad, and 7 spore-bearing plants) from
    a range of published and unpublished sources.  The principal sources were the
    'TFRC fruit and seed database' developed by Drs David Westcott, Andrew Dennis
    and Dan Metcalfe at the CSIRO the Tropical Forest Research Centre, and the Kew
    Seed Information Database (Liu et al., 2008). Direct estimates of oven-dry seed
    mass were available for 137 species, based on 1 to 9 samples per species, where
    each sample consists of 10 to 80 seeds from 2 to 40 parent plants.  For species
    of seed mass <50mg, each sample contained a minimum of 10 seeds, weighed together
    and assigned an average single-seed value.  Spore mass values were estimated or
    collated from taxonomic treatments.  For 70 species without direct measurements
    of seed mass, measured seed dimensions were used to estimate dry mass values using
    regression equations of seed dry mass on seed volume.

  replicates: 1
  methods: "Tissue density, or Basic Specific Gravity is expressed in units of dry
    mass per unit fresh volume, g cm-3 (equivalent to mg mm-3). Adult stem densities
    refer to heartwood densities (or 'inner' wood where heartwood is indistinct),
    while for seedlings, stem densities refer to the main stem, including any firmly
    attached bark. Wood densities were compiled for all 146 species with life-forms
    from shrubs to canopy trees (i.e. for all woody species excluding vines), from
    literature sources or new measurements.  These values are based on replicated
    measurements for 136 species (106 from earlier studies, and 30 from new field
    measurements June-October 2004), and secondly, estimates for 10 species were taken
    as an average of 2 to 5 congeners or confamilials of similar growth form and canopy
    light environment, from regional databases (Cause et al., 1989, World Agroforestry
    Centre, 2008, Zanne et al., 2009).  Any values measured at different moisture
    values (e.g. 'air-dry' 10 - 18% moisture) were converted to the standard density
    of oven dry mass per green volume, by multiplying the value by 0.861, following
    the most recent conversion formula estimated by Chave et al. (2009). \tWSG = 0.861
    * Dm  where Dm is the density at m% moisture  The new measurements made for 30
    species in this study were taken either by a corer of 5mm diameter to the centre
    of the stem at 1.3m height (for large species), or by taking a length of stem
    <=10cm at 1/3 of the plant height (for small species).  To quantify densities
    for heartwood alone, samples were cleaned of bark and any clearly defined sapwood.
    \ In cases where sapwood was indistinct from heartwood (e.g. many shrub species),
    1-3mm of outer wood was removed.  Fresh volume was estimated using the water displacement
    method for irregular-shaped samples (Heinrichs and Lassen, 1970), and oven dry
    mass determined after oven drying at 70degC (requiring 5-14 days to reach constant
    mass)."

  methods: Leaf Area is the mean projected area (in cm2) of a leaf or leaflet, to

  methods: Leaf lamina thickness (mm) was measured using a micrometer at 4 - 5 locations
    on the lamina between the secondary veins.  (Thereby avoiding major structural
    reinforcements such as raised veins.) When quantified for entire leaves rather
    than lamina alone, this size dimension may be more accurately expressed as total
    volume per unit laminar area, since thickness is variable and volume includes
    many distributed tissue types such as sclerenchyma (Poorter et al., 2009). However,
    individual leaf volume determinations were not made in this study, and so lamina
    thickness remains the only direct measure of leaf size other than projected area.

    rehydrated to saturation by storing them in darkness for 6-24 hours with cut stems
    placed in water.  Full-saturation measurements were then made of area (for LMA)
    and weight (for LDMC).  Leaf area was calculated from high-resolution scanned
    images of fresh, saturated leaves, using open-source software 'ImageJ' v1.3.4
    Image Processing and Analysis in Java (NIH, US Government, http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/index.html).  Dry
    weight was measured after drying at 60degC for >=48 hours (Garnier et al., 2001).

  trait_name: leaf_work_to_punch
  entity_type: individual
  value_type: mean
  basis_of_value: measurement
  replicates: 6-10
  methods: Leaf strength may be quantified as maximum 'force to fracture' (force),
    or 'work to fracture' (energy), and measures resistance to fracture initiation.  Many
    studies have used alternative methods and terminology, however these issues have
    been recently clarified by Onoda et al. (2011) ^p Leaf strength is distinct from
    leaf toughness, although the latter term was used in several studies that actually
    measured leaf punch strength (e.g. Coley and Aide, 1991, Reich et al., 1991).  Technically,
    toughness is the work or energy required to fracture the leaf, and is quantified
    by the area under a force vs displacement curve (Onoda et al., 2011). ^p In this
    study, leaf strength was estimated using a penetrometer with a flat-ended punch
    and narrow clearance (Aranwela et al., 1999, Sanson et al., 2001).  The hand-held
    penetrometer consisted of a flat-ended, sharp-edged metal 'probe' of 0.4 mm diameter,
    attached to a dial tension gauge. Two instruments were used, with tension gauge
    capacities of 0-50 g and 0-150 g. Each instrument was calibrated against an electronic
    pan balance, giving penetrometer readings within 0.2-0.5g of the balance reading.  This
    corresponds to a discrepancy of <0.04 MN m-2, which is far smaller than the variation
    among individual points on a leaf, and only 0.2% to 2% of leaf strength values.
    ^p During measurements, care was taken to maintain leaves in a fresh, fully hydrated
    state (as for LMA and LDM, above).  The leaf was held flat between two plastic
    sheets, with a small hole in each sheet for the probe to pass through, in order
    to control the 'clearance' and ensure that shearing was the predominant mode of
    fracture, rather than bending or tearing (Onoda et al., 2011). The force applied
    to drive the probe through the lamina was then read from the dial tension guage.  Mean
    values were taken from 6-10 punches, located semi-randomly to avoid primary and
    secondary veins, and to avoid areas close to earlier punches. ^p Three measures
    of leaf strength were calculated from these force measurements, i) leaf structural
    strength, LS - maximum force to punch, per unit fracture length (units, 10* kN
    m-1). LS is equivalent to 10* Fp "force to punch", as defined by Onoda et al.
    (2011), where fracture length is given by the punch circumference. This normalization
    by fracture length differs from the common normalization by punch area, but gives
    a more consistent physical basis for expression and comparison (Onoda et al.,
    2011).  Since the leaf usually fractures at the rim of the punch where force is
    most concentrated, the fracture length along the lamina surface is equal to the
    punch circumference. Values were multiplied by 10 for ease of reading, as otherwise

  methods: Leaf strength may be quantified as maximum 'force to fracture' (force),
    or 'work to fracture' (energy), and measures resistance to fracture initiation.  Many
    studies have used alternative methods and terminology, however these issues have
    been recently clarified by Onoda et al. (2011) ^p Leaf strength is distinct from
    leaf toughness, although the latter term was used in several studies that actually
    measured leaf punch strength (e.g. Coley and Aide, 1991, Reich et al., 1991).  Technically,
    toughness is the work or energy required to fracture the leaf, and is quantified
    by the area under a force vs displacement curve (Onoda et al., 2011). ^p In this
    study, leaf strength was estimated using a penetrometer with a flat-ended punch
    and narrow clearance (Aranwela et al., 1999, Sanson et al., 2001).  The hand-held
    penetrometer consisted of a flat-ended, sharp-edged metal 'probe' of 0.4 mm diameter,
    attached to a dial tension gauge. Two instruments were used, with tension gauge
    capacities of 0-50 g and 0-150 g. Each instrument was calibrated against an electronic
    pan balance, giving penetrometer readings within 0.2-0.5g of the balance reading.  This
    corresponds to a discrepancy of <0.04 MN m-2, which is far smaller than the variation
    among individual points on a leaf, and only 0.2% to 2% of leaf strength values.
    ^p During measurements, care was taken to maintain leaves in a fresh, fully hydrated
    state (as for LMA and LDM, above).  The leaf was held flat between two plastic
    sheets, with a small hole in each sheet for the probe to pass through, in order
    to control the 'clearance' and ensure that shearing was the predominant mode of
    fracture, rather than bending or tearing (Onoda et al., 2011). The force applied
    to drive the probe through the lamina was then read from the dial tension guage.  Mean
    values were taken from 6-10 punches, located semi-randomly to avoid primary and
    secondary veins, and to avoid areas close to earlier punches. ^p Three measures
    of leaf strength were calculated from these force measurements, i) leaf structural
    strength, LS - maximum force to punch, per unit fracture length (units, 10* kN
    m-1). LS is equivalent to 10* Fp "force to punch", as defined by Onoda et al.
    (2011), where fracture length is given by the punch circumference. This normalization
    by fracture length differs from the common normalization by punch area, but gives
    a more consistent physical basis for expression and comparison (Onoda et al.,
    2011).  Since the leaf usually fractures at the rim of the punch where force is
    most concentrated, the fracture length along the lamina surface is equal to the
    punch circumference. Values were multiplied by 10 for ease of reading, as otherwise
    all values were <1.0. ii) 'specific strength' LSS - maximum force to punch, per
    unit fracture cross-sectional area (units, 10* MN m-2), calculated by dividing
    LS by leaf thickness. iii) 'specific strength per density' LSD - the average resistance
    per unit dry mass, quantified by the maximum force per unit fracture cross-sectional
    area, per unit tissue density (units, N g-1 m), and calculated as 0.1 * LSS /
