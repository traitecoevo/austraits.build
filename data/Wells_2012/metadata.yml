  description: This research combines studies of plant phylogeny, trait inter-relations
    and seed dispersal, as a basis for understanding processes of natural regeneration
    in intact rainforests and secondary rainforests on abandoned pastures. It identifies
    four key dimensions of ecological variation among rainforest plants, each represented
    by a spectrum of correlated traits of plant life-history and ecophysiology, and
    highlights the importance of seed dispersal in shaping the distribution and ecological
    diversity of regeneration in secondary rainforests in Australia's Wet Tropics.

  sampling_strategy: Site description ^p  Field transects were surveyed in Brooks
    Valley, Mungalli, an area at the south-eastern edge of the Atherton Tablelands
    at 390 m altitude, between May and November 2003.  The area receives high rainfall
    of >4000 mm per annum with only rare occurrences of a month with rainfall <100
    mm during the cool season (May to October). The valley has has moderately-fertile
    basalt soils overlying deeper granites, and was formerly covered in 'Complex Mesophyll
    Vine Forest'  CMVF Type 1b with some areas of Mesophyll Vine Forest MVF 2a (Tracey,
    1982).  The area of secondary rainforest had regenerated (without management)
    over 50 years since the abandonment of moderately grazed dairy pastures, and the
    immediately adjacent primary forest is of CMVF Type 1b.  A map of the area is
    shown in Figure 1. ^p This site is within the traditional lands of Warribarra
    people, speakers of Mamu, in the Dyirbal language group (Dixon, 2002).  Mungalli
    is the name of the surrounding area, and is a Mamu word meaning meeting place,
    in reference to the confluence of streams and the Beatrice River south of the
    valley site.  This property and adjacent areas were cleared by the Brooks family
    between 1930 1939 (portions 513, 255, 256, and 257).   Portion 513 consists of
    20.23 ha (50 acres), with an East-West boundary at its northern edge adjoining
    primary rainforest.  The primary forest is continuous with the rainforests of
    Wooroonooran National Park (94,000 ha), and is classified as Complex Mesophyll
    Vine Forest 1b (Regional Ecosystem 7.8.1-7.8.2, classed as 'Endangered' due to
    fragmentation and clearance to <10% of its pre-clearing extent), with some elements
    of Mesophyll Vine Forest 2a on granite (R.E. 7.12.1, Goosem et al., 1999). ^p
    The area experiences high rainfall of over 4000 mm p.a., with monthly rainfalls
    of >70mm during the driest quarter.  The site is at an altitude of 390 m (range
    382-394 m), and occurs on moderate-fertility soils of the Maalan association,
    developed on old, very strongly weathered basaltic lava flows, with some influence
    of the underlying granite parent material (Laffan, 1988).  Soil cores taken for
    this study at 16 sampling locations yielded estimates of macronutrients and cations
    within the mid to upper ranges of values for basalt soils on the Atherton Tablelands
    (Spain 1990). ^p This rainforest type, CMVF 1b is characterised by complex floristics,
    and a high concentration of species that are rare, restricted and/or from early-diverging
    conifer and angiosperm lineages.  This ecosystem is classified as Regional Ecosystem
    7.8.2 (Endangered) or 7.8.1 (Of Concern), due to reduction to less than 10% of
    its pre-clearing extent.  CMVG 1b occurs mainly in a discontinuous fringe on the
    Atherton Tableland escarpments of the Mulgrave, Russell, and North Johnstone Rvier
    valleys, where basalt volcanics overlie older granitic and metamorphic rocks.  Extensive
    agricultural clearing of this forest type began in 1915, and only small areas
    were conserved in reservations (for timber), or in National Parks (Graham et al.,
    1996).  Currently 1968 ha is protected within the WTWHA, consisting of 1386 ha
    in Wooroonooran NP, and 574ha of a transitional type at Lakes Barrine and Eacham.
    ^p   Selective logging of rainforests occurred almost throughout the Wet Tropics
    at various frequencies and intensities from the 1890s until 1988.  Canopy disturbance
    will have altered regeneration conditions in these forests relative to their earlier
    dynamics, particularly through increased prevalence of small- to large-gap microsites.  However,
    selectively logged areas now represent the predominant form of 'intact' rainforest
    in the Wet Tropics, and the initial source of propagules for almost all areas
    of regeneration.  The 'intact' and secondary forest in Brooks Valley was selectively
    logged during the 1990s, and only a few, larger, trees were removed (none from
    within the study site). ^p The area surveyed in this study was cleared and converted
    to pasture at some time between 1934-1939, when it was cut manually, burnt, and
    seeded to generate pastures of African kikuya grass (Pinnesitum).  Later burns
    involved only localised, low-intensity surface fires.  Other areas of the land
    portion were used for pasture, crop-fields and orchards.  In the 1950s, after
    12-20 years of grazing at low to moderate intensity, fields were abandoned due
    to declining grass productivity, the valley's poor access for transport, and difficulty
    in lighting fires to control weeds.  The area developed into a mosaic of grassland,
    Lantana, and Rubus by 1964.  Sporadic grazing and weed-spraying occurred in two
    areas (<1 ha) until complete cessation of disturbance in 1973 in all secondary
    areas.  Remnant trees were rare (four trees over 8 ha), and native regeneration
    beneath shrub cover began with scattered trees of small-fruited species that are
    dispersed by wind or by birds that frequently move into open areas (primarily
    pied currawongs, Lewin's honeyeater, parrots, and brown cuckoo-doves).  By 1977,
    extensive areas were covered in heterogeneous regrowth, with patches of Rubus
    and Lantana, and larger patches of closed secondary forest.  These patches coalesced
    to form a near-continuous closed canopy by the mid-1980s.  Some areas of the secondary
    forest were selectively logged in the 1990s, resulting in a small number of stumps
    and minor light gaps (none within the study transects). ^pThe boundary between
    primary and secondary rainforests was defined by the original fence line between
    the primary forest and areas cleared for grazing. Distances were estimated from
    local parish maps, and the exact position was confirmed by locating six decaying
    fence posts at various distances along the surveyed boundary line. The former
    fenceline runs at an angle of 104.8deg to grid north, 98.5deg to magnetic north
    (2003 surveys), and transects were oriented perpendicular to this fenceline. ^p  Three
    transects ran 40m through intact rainforest and 140 180m into adjacent secondary
    rainforest.  Trees >3cm dbh were surveyed over 10 x 180m on two transects of 180
    m length, separated by 105 m.  Saplings >0.8 m height were surveyed over the central
    5 x 180 m.   Seedlings from 4th leaf stage to 0.8 m tall were surveyed on 3 transects
    of 1 x 220 m, separated by 45 and 60 m (transects consisting of the central 1m
    of the other transects, and one additional transect). ^p   3. Transect survey
    methods    ^p    Two transects of 180 m length were surveyed for trees and saplings
    =0.8m tall, and three transects of 220 m were surveyed for seedlings <0.8m tall,
    between May and November 2003.  The transects were positioned by identifying points
    along the original fenceline as a baseline (using remains of three fence posts
    and the original compass directions from land records), and running the the transects
    at right angles to this baseline, extending 40 m into the primary forest and 140
    or 180 m into the secondary forest.  ^p   Transects 1 and 2 were 10 x 180 m and
    spaced 95m apart (transect mid-points 105 m apart).  Plants <U+F0B3>3cm dbh were
    surveyed over the full 10 x 180m of transects 1 and 2.  Saplings <U+F0B3> 0.8m
    height were surveyed on a strip 5 m wide, at the centre of transects 1 and 2 (sub-transect
    5 x 180m).  All seedlings from the 4th leaf stage to a height of 0.8 m were surveyed
    along three transects of 1 x 220m.  These transects consist of the central 1m
    of transects 1 and 2, extending a further 40m into the secondary forest (1 x 220m),
    and a third transect of 1x220m, located 40m from transect 1, and 65 m from transect
    2.

- var_in: seed_mass_to_use
  unit_in: mg
  trait_name: seed_mass
  value_type: expert_mean
  replicates: 1-9
  methods: Seed mass is here defined as the oven-dry mass of the seed including any
    tissues strongly attached to the embryo or endosperm (e.g. testa, endocarp), but
    excluding any flesh or dispersal appendages. Seed dry mass values (mg) were obtained
    for all 207 species (199 angiosperms, 1 cycad, and 7 spore-bearing plants) from
    a range of published and unpublished sources.  The principal sources were the
    'TFRC fruit and seed database' developed by Drs David Westcott, Andrew Dennis
    and Dan Metcalfe at the CSIRO the Tropical Forest Research Centre, and the Kew
    Seed Information Database (Liu et al., 2008). Direct estimates of oven-dry seed
    mass were available for 137 species, based on 1 to 9 samples per species, where
    each sample consists of 10 to 80 seeds from 2 to 40 parent plants.  For species
    of seed mass <50mg, each sample contained a minimum of 10 seeds, weighed together
    and assigned an average single-seed value.  Spore mass values were estimated or
    collated from taxonomic treatments.  For 70 species without direct measurements
    of seed mass, measured seed dimensions were used to estimate dry mass values using
    regression equations of seed dry mass on seed volume.
- var_in: StemDensity_to_use
  unit_in: g/cm3
  trait_name: wood_density
  value_type: raw_value
  replicates: 1
  methods: "Tissue density, or Basic Specific Gravity is expressed in units of dry
    mass per unit fresh volume, g cm-3 (equivalent to mg mm-3). Adult stem densities
    refer to heartwood densities (or 'inner' wood where heartwood is indistinct),
    while for seedlings, stem densities refer to the main stem, including any firmly
    attached bark. Wood densities were compiled for all 146 species with life-forms
    from shrubs to canopy trees (i.e. for all woody species excluding vines), from
    literature sources or new measurements.  These values are based on replicated
    measurements for 136 species (106 from earlier studies, and 30 from new field
    measurements June-October 2004), and secondly, estimates for 10 species were taken
    as an average of 2 to 5 congeners or confamilials of similar growth form and canopy
    light environment, from regional databases (Cause et al., 1989, World Agroforestry
    Centre, 2008, Zanne et al., 2009).  Any values measured at different moisture
    values (e.g. 'air-dry' 10 - 18% moisture) were converted to the standard density
    of oven dry mass per green volume, by multiplying the value by 0.861, following
    the most recent conversion formula estimated by Chave et al. (2009). \tWSG = 0.861
    * Dm  where Dm is the density at m% moisture  The new measurements made for 30
    species in this study were taken either by a corer of 5mm diameter to the centre
    of the stem at 1.3m height (for large species), or by taking a length of stem
    <=10cm at 1/3 of the plant height (for small species).  To quantify densities
    for heartwood alone, samples were cleaned of bark and any clearly defined sapwood.
    \ In cases where sapwood was indistinct from heartwood (e.g. many shrub species),
    1-3mm of outer wood was removed.  Fresh volume was estimated using the water displacement
    method for irregular-shaped samples (Heinrichs and Lassen, 1970), and oven dry
    mass determined after oven drying at 70degC (requiring 5-14 days to reach constant
    mass)."
- var_in: LA
  unit_in: cm2
  trait_name: leaf_area
  value_type: raw_value
  replicates: 1
  methods: Leaf Area is the mean projected area (in cm2) of a leaf or leaflet, to
    the natural point of abscission. This whole-leaf area includes the (small) area
    of petiole or rachis, and so would be very slightly larger than the 'lamina only'
    measurement of leaf size recommended by Cornelissen et al. (2003).
- var_in: LtLeaf
  unit_in: mm
  trait_name: leaf_thickness
  value_type: individual_mean
  replicates: 4-5
  methods: Leaf lamina thickness (mm) was measured using a micrometer at 4 - 5 locations
    on the lamina between the secondary veins.  (Thereby avoiding major structural
    reinforcements such as raised veins.) When quantified for entire leaves rather
    than lamina alone, this size dimension may be more accurately expressed as total
    volume per unit laminar area, since thickness is variable and volume includes
    many distributed tissue types such as sclerenchyma (Poorter et al., 2009). However,
    individual leaf volume determinations were not made in this study, and so lamina
    thickness remains the only direct measure of leaf size other than projected area.
- var_in: LMA
  unit_in: g/m2
  trait_name: specific_leaf_area
  value_type: raw_value
  replicates: 1
  methods: LMA and LDM were measured using standard protocols (Garnier et al., 2001,
    Cornelissen et al., 2003).  Samples were taken >= 2-3 hrs after sunrise, and >=3-4
    hrs before sunset, and transported in cool, moist papers.  Leaves were then be
    rehydrated to saturation by storing them in darkness for 6-24 hours with cut stems
    placed in water.  Full-saturation measurements were then made of area (for LMA)
    and weight (for LDMC).  Leaf area was calculated from high-resolution scanned
    images of fresh, saturated leaves, using open-source software 'ImageJ' v1.3.4
    Image Processing and Analysis in Java (NIH, US Government, http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/index.html).  Dry
    weight was measured after drying at 60degC for >=48 hours (Garnier et al., 2001).

- var_in: LSleaf
  unit_in: 10^1*kN/m
  trait_name: leaf_work_to_punch
  value_type: individual_mean
  replicates: 6-10
  methods: Leaf strength may be quantified as maximum 'force to fracture' (force),
    or 'work to fracture' (energy), and measures resistance to fracture initiation.  Many
    studies have used alternative methods and terminology, however these issues have
    been recently clarified by Onoda et al. (2011) ^p Leaf strength is distinct from
    leaf toughness, although the latter term was used in several studies that actually
    measured leaf punch strength (e.g. Coley and Aide, 1991, Reich et al., 1991).  Technically,
    toughness is the work or energy required to fracture the leaf, and is quantified
    by the area under a force vs displacement curve (Onoda et al., 2011). ^p In this
    study, leaf strength was estimated using a penetrometer with a flat-ended punch
    and narrow clearance (Aranwela et al., 1999, Sanson et al., 2001).  The hand-held
    penetrometer consisted of a flat-ended, sharp-edged metal 'probe' of 0.4 mm diameter,
    attached to a dial tension gauge. Two instruments were used, with tension gauge
    capacities of 0-50 g and 0-150 g. Each instrument was calibrated against an electronic
    pan balance, giving penetrometer readings within 0.2-0.5g of the balance reading.  This
    corresponds to a discrepancy of <0.04 MN m-2, which is far smaller than the variation
    among individual points on a leaf, and only 0.2% to 2% of leaf strength values.
    ^p During measurements, care was taken to maintain leaves in a fresh, fully hydrated
    state (as for LMA and LDM, above).  The leaf was held flat between two plastic
    sheets, with a small hole in each sheet for the probe to pass through, in order
    to control the 'clearance' and ensure that shearing was the predominant mode of
    fracture, rather than bending or tearing (Onoda et al., 2011). The force applied
    to drive the probe through the lamina was then read from the dial tension guage.  Mean
    values were taken from 6-10 punches, located semi-randomly to avoid primary and
    secondary veins, and to avoid areas close to earlier punches. ^p Three measures
    of leaf strength were calculated from these force measurements, i) leaf structural
    strength, LS - maximum force to punch, per unit fracture length (units, 10* kN
    m-1). LS is equivalent to 10* Fp "force to punch", as defined by Onoda et al.
    (2011), where fracture length is given by the punch circumference. This normalization
    by fracture length differs from the common normalization by punch area, but gives
    a more consistent physical basis for expression and comparison (Onoda et al.,
    2011).  Since the leaf usually fractures at the rim of the punch where force is
    most concentrated, the fracture length along the lamina surface is equal to the
    punch circumference. Values were multiplied by 10 for ease of reading, as otherwise
    all values were <1.0. ii) 'specific strength' LSS - maximum force to punch, per
    unit fracture cross-sectional area (units, 10* MN m-2), calculated by dividing
    LS by leaf thickness. iii) 'specific strength per density' LSD - the average resistance
    per unit dry mass, quantified by the maximum force per unit fracture cross-sectional
    area, per unit tissue density (units, N g-1 m), and calculated as 0.1 * LSS /
    LDM.

    studies have used alternative methods and terminology, however these issues have
    been recently clarified by Onoda et al. (2011) ^p Leaf strength is distinct from
    leaf toughness, although the latter term was used in several studies that actually
    measured leaf punch strength (e.g. Coley and Aide, 1991, Reich et al., 1991).  Technically,
    toughness is the work or energy required to fracture the leaf, and is quantified
    by the area under a force vs displacement curve (Onoda et al., 2011). ^p In this
    study, leaf strength was estimated using a penetrometer with a flat-ended punch
    and narrow clearance (Aranwela et al., 1999, Sanson et al., 2001).  The hand-held
    penetrometer consisted of a flat-ended, sharp-edged metal 'probe' of 0.4 mm diameter,
    attached to a dial tension gauge. Two instruments were used, with tension gauge
    capacities of 0-50 g and 0-150 g. Each instrument was calibrated against an electronic
    pan balance, giving penetrometer readings within 0.2-0.5g of the balance reading.  This
    corresponds to a discrepancy of <0.04 MN m-2, which is far smaller than the variation
    among individual points on a leaf, and only 0.2% to 2% of leaf strength values.
    ^p During measurements, care was taken to maintain leaves in a fresh, fully hydrated
    state (as for LMA and LDM, above).  The leaf was held flat between two plastic
    sheets, with a small hole in each sheet for the probe to pass through, in order
    to control the 'clearance' and ensure that shearing was the predominant mode of
    fracture, rather than bending or tearing (Onoda et al., 2011). The force applied
    to drive the probe through the lamina was then read from the dial tension guage.  Mean
    values were taken from 6-10 punches, located semi-randomly to avoid primary and
    secondary veins, and to avoid areas close to earlier punches. ^p Three measures
    of leaf strength were calculated from these force measurements, i) leaf structural
    strength, LS - maximum force to punch, per unit fracture length (units, 10* kN
    m-1). LS is equivalent to 10* Fp "force to punch", as defined by Onoda et al.
    (2011), where fracture length is given by the punch circumference. This normalization
    by fracture length differs from the common normalization by punch area, but gives
    a more consistent physical basis for expression and comparison (Onoda et al.,
    2011).  Since the leaf usually fractures at the rim of the punch where force is
    most concentrated, the fracture length along the lamina surface is equal to the
    punch circumference. Values were multiplied by 10 for ease of reading, as otherwise
    all values were <1.0. ii) 'specific strength' LSS - maximum force to punch, per
    unit fracture cross-sectional area (units, 10* MN m-2), calculated by dividing
    LS by leaf thickness. iii) 'specific strength per density' LSD - the average resistance
    per unit dry mass, quantified by the maximum force per unit fracture cross-sectional
    area, per unit tissue density (units, N g-1 m), and calculated as 0.1 * LSS /
    LDM.

questions:
  contributor: Across what years were these measurements made?
  question2: There are a number of column in the "individuals" data file that I can't
    quite figure out. I think I've captured all the ones that matter, but want to
    confirm that the column names including "sample" refers to a sample of multitple
    leaves - with the leaf count in the column'Nleavesfrac'.
  question3: The units you give in your metadata file for 'work to punch'  and 'specific
    work to punch' are different from those given in your thesis. Since those in your
    thesis match both Onoda 2011 (which you cite) and other datasets in AusTraits
    I'm assuming those are correct.
  question4: I have filtered plant height so that for each species duplicate values
    (within your study) are not read into AusTraits; I realize that for the vines/lianas
    where you have site_max values this may have removed a few legitimate duplicates,
    but I suspect very few. (I've also filtered all species-level variables so they
    are only read in once per species.)
  question5: Under dispersers, 'chr' is listed as a value but isn't in the key' is
    this 'cassowary flying_foxes rodents' (as for 'chsr'). What about 'clfor'? Is
    that an alternative code for 'cassowary'?
  question6: should I be including John Kanowski's references as secondary references
    for this study? And should he be included as an author?
  question7: For both wood density (stem density) and seed mass I've filtered out
    values duplicated within AusTraits, since for these traits some of your data was
    sourced from other databases that we have included. I'd expected your wood density
    data would be tangled up with those submitted by Amy Zanne and in Jugi Ilic and
    Rob Kooyman's datasets. I easily removed your data from the Zanne dataset (she'd
    flagged them as yours) and then easily filtered Ilic/Kooyman data out of your
    dataset, trying to follow our goal of attaching data values to their primary source
    whenever possible. I still have ~15 max plant height values that are duplicates
    of Rob Kooyman's dataset, but assume those are co-incidental duplicates and should
    remain in the dataset. For seed mass, I ran our automated function that picks
    up duplicates and filters those out. I've attached the merged data file - it includes
    columns that indicates the presumed original data source. For data attributed
    to Kew we simply don't have that raw study in AusTraits.
  question8: Don't worry about all the supposed "missing values" - this is an artifact
    of only reading in a single value per species for species level traits, when the
    spreadsheet has 2000+ rows.
