  notes: none
sites:
  Kuringgai National Park:
    longitude (deg): 151.1430556
    latitude (deg): -33.6938889
    georeference remarks: lat and lon are approximate; values used are those from
      Wright_2002
contexts: .na
traits:
- var_in: Density
  unit_in: mg/mm3
  trait_name: wood_density
  value_type: raw_value
  replicates: 1
  methods: Wood density measured at successive locations along a branch; these locations
    are documented in the contextual column.
- var_in: specific_leaf_area
  unit_in: mm2/mg
  trait_name: .na
  value_type: site_mean
  replicates: unknown
  methods: assume scanned and area measured with ImageJ software, or equivalent; leaves
    dried and weighted; these values are part of the larger Westoby_2003 dataset
- var_in: leaf_size_filtered
  unit_in: mm2
  trait_name: leaf_area
  value_type: site_mean
  replicates: unknown
  methods: assume scanned and area measured with ImageJ software, or equivalent; all
    but two of these values are part of the larger Westoby_2003 dataset
