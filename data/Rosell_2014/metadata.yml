  description: To assess hypotheses regarding tradeoffs and functional coordination,
    we measured bark traits reflecting protection, storage, mechanics, and photosynthesis
    in branches of 90 species spanning a wide phylogenetic and environmental range.
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: LOCALITIES AND SAMPLING  We measured traits of 90 species in
    six localities ranging from xerophytic shrubland to tropical rainforest in Mexico
    and Australia (Table 1). The selection of species aimed to maximize phylogenetic
    spread, across 41 families in 20 orders of angiosperms (Supporting Information
    Table S1), and spanned a wide range of bark morphology (Fig. 1b-h). We sampled
    the base of 1-m-long branches of five individuals per species, except for the
    rainforest, where three replicates were collected. Sun-exposed leading branches
    were collected, with bark that in the great majority of cases had similar morphology
    to the bark of main trunks (i.e. with outer bark already developed). BARK THICKNESS,
    DENSITY, AND WATER CONTENT  We estimated bark thickness as the difference between
    the diameters of the whole stem and of the wood (based on two perpendicular measurements
    each) divided by two. Relative bark thickness equaled two times bark thickness
    divided by wood diameter. We standardized by the size of the wood cylinder to
    reflect the relative allocation to these two tissues. Although most studies on
    bark thickness have concentrated on main stems, we focused on branches with fully
    developed bark, but without the accumulation over many years that characterizes
    main stem bark. In this way, we were able to better reflect the relative initial
    allocation between bark and xylem. Coordination between bark and other plant parts
    would seem more likely to occur via the inner living portion of bark. To examine
    this notion, we calculated density and water content for the total bark, as well
    as for the inner living portion only (mostly secondary phloem, and cortex if any;
    Fig. 1a).

  value_type: site_mean
  replicates: 3-5
  methods: We cut two stem disks 0.5-1 cm tall at the point where bark thickness was
    measured. We carefully removed outer bark from one of the disks with a razor blade.
    We calculated the density of wood and of total and inner bark as the ratio of
    oven-dried mass to fresh volume. Samples were dried at 100 deg C for 4 d to measure
    dry mass (Williamson & Wiemann, 2010). Fresh volume was measured using the water
    displacement method and an analytical balance. We calculated the water content
    of total and inner bark and of wood as the fresh weight minus the dry weight divided
    by the dry weight, to reflect the mass of water expressed as a percentage of the
    tissue's dry mass. To calculate the percentage of the total water in the stem
    that is stored in bark, we first estimated the amount of water in bark per unit
    volume. We then multiplied this amount by the volume of bark of an imaginary disk
    with area equal to the cross-sectional area of bark and height equal to 1. We
    repeated the same procedure to calculate the amount of water in wood. The percentage
    of stem water stored in bark equaled water in bark/(water in wood + water in bark)  x
    100.

  methods: 'Structural modulus of whole stem; We collected straight, relatively unbranched

    three point bending tests on segments with a 1 : 20 span : length ratio using
    a universal testing machine (Instron 5542; Instron, Canton, MA, USA). We measured
    the flexural stiffness (EI) of the whole branch (EIstruct) and of the wood (EIwood),
    testing whole and debarked segments. The difference between these two quantities
    was used as EIbark, the flexural stiffness of bark (Niklas, 1999). We then computed
    moments of inertia (I) for the stem, the wood, and the bark using formulas for
    hollow cylindrical cross-sections (Gere & Timoshenko, 1999), averaging basal and
    apical diameters of the whole stem, bark, wood, and pith. We excluded pith area
    from calculations of I. The elastic moduli (E) of whole branches (Estruct), wood
    (Ewood), and bark (Ebark) resulted from dividing EI by I. In addition, we estimated
    the modulus of rupture of wood (MOR) as (Fmax x  x Rwood)/4Iwood, where Fmax is
    the maximum load on the debarked segment at breakage, L is the length between
