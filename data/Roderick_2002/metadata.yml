  description: A dataset to test whether leaf area was proportional to leaf mass within
    a given species despite vaiations in leaf thickness and relative water content
    (mass fraction of liquid matter) across species
  collection_type: common_garden
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: We measured leaves collected from 15 broad-leaved species growing
    on the campus of the Australian National University between December 2000 and
    April 2001. For each species, we recorded the mass, area, thickness and dry mass
    of ten individual leaves in three separate groups, giving a total of 30 leaves
    per species. The leaves were selected from different parts of the plants to span
    a large range of mass, area, and age. For seven of the species studied, we had
    previously reported the mass and area of two sun and two shade leaves (Roderick
    et al. 1999b). Those measurements were used to check the robustmess of the area-mass
    relationship.

traits:
- var_in: leaf_fresh_mass_g
  unit_in: g
  trait_name: leaf_fresh_mass
  value_type: raw_value
  replicates: 1
  methods: Once thickness measurements were complete, the leaves were removed from
    the plant and taken immediately to the laboratory where the mass and projected
    area of each was measured. Within each group of ten leaves, we visually selected
    the largest leaf and measured the mass of that leaf at 2 min intervals over an
    8 min period.  These measuremeans were subsequently used to estimate the loss
    of mass that would have occurred while the leaves were transported to the laboratory,
    and then to assess whether this would lead to significant errors. The leaves were
    oven-dried at 80 deg C for at least 48 hours after which the dry mass of each
    was determined.

  unit_in: g
  trait_name: leaf_dry_mass
  value_type: raw_value

  methods: For each species, we recorded the mass, area, thickness and dry mass of
    ten individual leaves in three separate groups, giving a total of 30 leaves per
    species. The leaves were oven-dried at 80 deg C for at least 48 hours after which
    the dry mass of each was determined.
- var_in: leaf_area_cm2
  unit_in: cm2
  trait_name: leaf_area
  value_type: raw_value

  methods: For each species, we recorded the mass, area, thickness and dry mass of
    ten individual leaves in three separate groups, giving a total of 30 leaves per
    species. Once thickness measurements were complete, the leaves were removed from
    the plant and taken immediately to the laboratory where the mass and projected
    area of each was measured.
- var_in: leaf_thickness_um
  unit_in: um
  trait_name: leaf_thickness
  value_type: raw_value
  replicates: 1
  methods: Leaf thickness was measured in three places on each leaf using a dial thickness
    gauge while the leaves were still attached to the plant. An average of these measurements
    was used as an estimate of leaf thickness. Note that the thickness of some of
    the leaves was difficult to measure accurately in this way because of the leaf
    structure (e.g. protruding veins, etc.). Thus, our estimate of leaf thickness
    may not be very accurate for some species, but is precise enough for ou purpose
    because the thickness measurements were only used to determine whether the thickness
    of leaves from each species was (roughly) constant.
