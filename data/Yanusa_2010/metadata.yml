  description: An assessment of traits (sapwood area, sapwood density and leaf area
    index) that control transpiration to identify the dominant anatomical and physiological
    traits that control transpiration under extended drought conditions.
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: This study was undertaken at the Reef Hills State Park (36°36'S,
    145°56'E or AMG Zone 55, Easting 403442, Northing 594857) located near Benalla
    in Victoria, Australia. It covers 2032 ha and the vegetation can be generally
    classified as Heathy Dry Forest (Muir et al., 1995). The park forms part of Box-Ironbark
    forests and woodlands of almost three million hectares that covers almost 13%
    of the state of Victoria in Australia (Parks Victoria, 2007). Annual rainfall
    for the district is about 670 mm with almost one third of this falling during
    winter (June-August) when cold westerly winds dominate and mean daily temperature
    falls below 10 °C; occasionally the minimum temperature falls to 0 °C and frosts
    occur especially from mid-winter to early spring. Summers are generally warm to
    hot with daily mean temperature of 20.6 °C, and is generally dry except for occasional
    heavy storms. The park was heavily grazed after the cessation of mining in the
    early decades of the twentieth century, the declaration of the park as a reserve
    has since alleviated grazing and facilitated recovery of the native vegetation.
    There was limited routine harvesting of wood for fuel and timber up until 1988
    when the practice was stopped, and there has been no record of wildfires in recent
    decades. The park has substantial sapling undergrowth (Meers and Adams, 2003),
    and at the commencement of this study in 2006, the dominant tree species were
    approximately 50 years old. ^p We chose a single block of approximately one hectare
    (62 m x 160 m) that was dominated by Eucalyptus camaldulensis (Red River Gum)
    and E. microcarpa (Grey Box) as over-storey species. The chosen block was split
    into two distinct zones each of approximately 0.5 ha in which the surface soils
    have contrasting texture. A census of all young and mature trees, including the
    shrubs, and measurement of their diameter at breast height (DBH) was undertaken
    in May 2005. Heat-pulse sensors (SF 300, Greenspan Technology, Australia) were
    used to monitor sapflow in selected trees. Two trees of each species were instrumented
    in the clay-zone and the sand-zone. Each tree was supplied with two probe-sets
    consisting of a heater and a pair of thermistors that were implanted into the
    trunk to a depth of 25 mm, after removal of the bark. The two probe heads were
    installed on to the opposite sides of the trunks and separated by a vertical distance
    of at least 1.5 m. The probe-sets and the area of their implantation were wrapped
    with aluminum sheets to prevent exposure to the sun. Water stored in the soil
    profile was measured with a neutron probe (CPN, 503 DR HYDROPROBE) using pre-installed
    aluminum access tubes to six metre depth and were spaced at 5 or 10 m intervals
    across the two soils and were monitored mostly every fortnight, but sometimes
    longer, intervals throughout the study period. Each soil types had 10 access tubes.
    Sapwood area and other trunk tissue parameters (wood density and wood:water ratio)
    were measured on core samples taken from the trunk of each instrumented tree in
    January 2007. Temperature, humidity, wind speed, solar radiation and rainfall
    were monitored with an automatic weather station installed over a short scrub
    of vegetation about 150 m from the forest.

locations:
  Reef Hills State Park, clay-zone:
    latitude (deg): -36.6
    longitude (deg): 145.93
    description: heathy dry forest
    precipitation, MAP (mm): 670
    locality: Benalla, Victoria
    soil type: clay zone
    soil notes: Surface soils of sandy clay in a depression. Had a wetter profile
      due to extra water supply through subsurface lateral flow from the adjoining,
      topographically higher, sand-zone. The eastern half of the chosen block with
      a top profile of sandy clay lying in a depression having a gentle slope (around
      2%) that levels out at about 2.0 m to the west.
  Reef Hills State Park, sand-zone:
    latitude (deg): -36.6
    longitude (deg): 145.93
    description: heathy dry forest
    precipitation, MAP (mm): 670
    locality: Benalla, Victoria
    soil type: sand zone
    soil notes: Surface soils of loamy sand underlain by a dense profile on the terraces.
      Had a lower water avaliability. It is the western half of the block and is a
      terraced alluvium Riverine plain commencing from the edge of the depression
      and with a topsoil of loamy sand, which is underlain with clay or clay loam.
