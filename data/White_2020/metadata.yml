  description: Compilation of trait data for Victorian plant species
  basis_of_record: literature, field
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: Compilation of trait data for Victorian plant species from diverse
    sources. Data are generally linked to specific plot data. As a result, there are
    some species names not recognised by APC/APNI, because when the phrase names or
    varieties/subspecies/etc associated with the study cannot be linked to an APC/APNI
    name, the original name is maintained. For some species with a number of subspecies
    or recognised varieties, the trait values for the species are applied to all subspecies/varieties/affinities,
    based on the expert opinion of the dataset's authors.

  notes: Compilation of vital attribute data for Victorian plant species compiled
    from diverse sources; includes many phrase names used by individual researchers
    and only in ALA, not APC/APNI, but kept by White to maintain connection to these
    studies

questions:
  contributor: There are a few species with multiple lifespan categories. In each
    case I've assigned the "oldest" category included, but if marking two different
    age caregories represents regional variation (or similar) I could instead list
    multiple categories. Which is more appropriate? Similarly, with age of maturity,
    there is a single species with both '<1' and '1-5' marked - here I've used the
    younger category for now, reflecting the youngest age at which the species is
    reproductively mature, but could again include both categories.
