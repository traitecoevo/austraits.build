  basis_of_record: field

  sampling_strategy: History of fire ^p The fire history of Two Peoples Bay Nature
    Reserve since European settlement was compiled from Department of Conservation
    and Land Management records and the Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and
    Attractions (DBCA) GIS fire history database (accessed January and February 2024).
    These records include delineation of fire scars on aerial photography and the
    personal records and accounts of local people and agency staff responsible for
    managing the Reserve (see Supplementary material Table S1). In addition, on the
    earliest available aerial photography of the area, which was taken in March 1946
    by the Department of Defence for mapping purposes, patterns of small mosaic burning
    can be seen. This photography shows the scars of numerous small fires along the
    coast and between the granite outcrops throughout Maardjitup Gurlin/Gardner headland.
    Larger fire scars are evident in the isthmus and western boundary areas (Fig.
    2). This pre-1960 fire history is considered in the context of Djimaalup/noisy
    scrub-bird habitat. ^p Fire response of flora ^p Floristic composition was documented
    in 27 10 m x 10 m quadrats on the Maardjitup Gurlin/Mt Gardner headland. Five
    of these quadrats were established in the spring prior to the November 2015 fire
    and had pre-fire floristic data. Immediately after the 2015 fire, an additional
    22 quadrats were established in the areas of previously long unburnt vegetation
    that burnt in the fire (Fig. 3). The 27 quadrats were stratified across three
    habitats (1) shrublands on granite outcrops; (2) shrublands/thickets on the slopes
    below the granite outcrops; and (3) heath/sedgelands on plains in deep sands,
    with nine quadrats in each of the three habitats.

    notes: Two Peoples Bay Nature Reserve occupies 4774.7 ha on the south coast of
      Western Australia, east of Albany. Physiographically, it is dominated by the
      granite inselberg Maardjitup Gurlin (Noongar name for Mt Gardner), attaining
      408 m in height at the end of the eastern peninsula (Fig. 1). An isthmus to
      the west gives way to lowlands of dunes and wetlands, with a low lateritic plateau
      in the north west (Smith 1987). Much of the western south coast is flanked by
      limestone rocks and platform reefs (Sinker Reef). Four islands are included
      in the Reserve (Fig. 1), which receives approximately 800 mm of rainfall each
      year.
