  description: We combined new field measurements of LA:SA ratios with published values
    and values from unpublished studies at sites across a range of Australian environments,
    from wet to semi-arid and cool-temperate to tropical climates. We used these data
    which come from trees ofdifferent heights, and include measurements on whole trees
    as well as branches to test the general scaling relationships between LA and SA.
  basis_of_record:
  life_stage: unknown
  sampling_strategy: We measured LA and SA on four branches per tree of ten evergreen
    angiosperm species at Robson Creek, Danbulla National Park, Queensland (17°070S,
    145°370E). Data for a further 170 species were contributed from 25 sites, based
    on seven published and two unpublished studies. We also compiled 258 published
    measurements on 151 species from 43 sites. The data comprised measurements from
    183 species, at the locations shown in Fig. 1. The full dataset was composed of
    252 measurements on branches and 175 on whole trees.

  methods: Leaf area was measured using a desktop scanner for all leaves on a sampled
    branch. After bark removal, the branch cross-sectional area was measured with
    a digital caliper at two points near the cut (methodology that includes the non-conductive
    part of the sapwood). The pith cross-sectional area was measured and subtracted
    from the branch cross-sectional area. For compiled and contributed data, measurements
    on branches were made as described above, although with a variable number of branches
    sampled per tree. In some studies where the branch diameter was too small (<10
    mm), the pith was considered part of the sapwood. For whole trees, cross-sectional
    sapwood area was measured at 1.3 m above the ground from bored cores or harvesting
    the tree. Leaf area in whole trees was in most cases measured from harvested trees.
