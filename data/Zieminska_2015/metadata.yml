  description: Study investigating the anatomical underpinnings of wood density in
    trees and shrubs, by analysing wood components including fibre wall and lumen,
    vessel wall and lumen, and axial and ray parenchyma.
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: Four sites were chosen that spanned a wide range of temperature and aridity in eastern Australia. The objective of site selection was to generate a broad range of trait values rather than to enable site comparisons. All carried natural, undisturbed vegetation growing on oligotrophic soils on flat to slightly sloping terrain. Two locations in Tasmania, at 43 deg S, represented low mean annual temperature (MAT; 10.6 deg C), and two locations in Queensland near 18 deg S represented higher MAT (c. 22.5 deg C). Within each latitude, two locations were chosen so as to differ markedly in aridity index (AI; Willmott and Feddema 1992), the ratio of mean annual precipitation (MAP) to potential evapotranspiration (PET). In both Queensland and Tasmania the wetter site had an AI c. 1.0 and the drier site c. 0.6. MAP, MAT and PET were obtained from GIS (geographic information system) layers from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology. At each of the four sites, six abundant and phylogenetically distinct woody eudicot species were chosen for sampling (species listed in Table 1). One species was sampled at two sites, yielding a total of 23 species from eight families. Distal, sun-exposed twigs of trees and shrubs were collected from three replicate individuals per species. The diameter under bark of twigs varied from 4 mm in plants with little pith to 10 mm in plants with higher pith content. Consequently the diameter of wood, excluding bark and pith, was 4–5 mm. This plant material is referred to here as twigs, although in several small shrub species 'twigs' were the main stems. Plant material was cut into segments 10–15 cm long and kept wet in sealed plastic bags in the refrigerator (4 8C).Wood density was measured within a week from collection; other parts of the same twigs were placed in fixative for later measurement of anatomical properties (details below).

  methods: Wood density was measured on segments 3–5 cm long for each twig sample. Bark and pith were removed and measurements were carried out on xylem only. In this paper we refer to xylem as ‘wood’. After removing bark and pith, wood pieces were soaked in water for at least 48 h prior to volume measurement. Then a beaker filled with water was placed on a balance (0.0001 g, Mettler AE 160). A thin wire platform was suspended in water so that it did not touch the side or bottom of the beaker. The balance was tared before each measurement and a sample was gently placed on the platform. The mass of displaced water was read from the balance. From standard water density of 1 g cm23 and knowing the mass of displaced water, we calculated sample volumes applying Archimedes’ buoyancy principle (e.g. 1 g of displaced water equals 1 cm3 volume). Samples were then placed in paper envelopes and dried at 70 deg C for at least 72 h. Wood density was calculated as the dry mass divided by water saturated volume (g cm23).
