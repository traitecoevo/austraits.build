  description: Our aim was to assess the magnitude of anatomical variation within
    a restricted range of wood density and explore its potential ecological implications.

  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: Three sites were chosen along the east coast of Australia, in
    New South Wales (NSW) and Queensland (QLD), in such a way as to give rise to contrasts
    both of temperature and of precipitation (site details in Table 1, site photographs
    in S1 Fig). A cool temperate forest site was located in Kosciuszko National Park,
    NSW (36.48 deg S). The two warm sites were located in Queensland; a tropical woodland
    in Girringun National Park (18.16 deg S) and a tropical wet rainforest in Daintree
    National Park (16.10 deg S). The two tropical sites have similar mean annual temperature
    of c. 22 deg C but vary markedly in mean annual precipitation (4230 mm and 995
    mm respectively), with the lower-rainfall woodland also having a more severe dry
    season around three times longer (i.e., 9 months vs. 3 months; Table 1). Mean
    annual temperature at the temperate site (c. 7 deg C, being at 1300m elevation)
    is approximately 15 deg C lower than at the tropical sites, and mean annual precipitation
    is 1835 mm of rainfall or equivalent snow. A canopy crane at the Daintree Rainforest
    Observatory (James Cook University) was used to collect twigs from tall trees.
    Shorter species were collected from the ground, and all species were collected
    within one kilometre radius from the crane. Species in the tropical woodland and
    the temperate forest were collected within a radius of c. 5 kilometres from the
    coordinates provided in Table 1 (except for two species in the tropical woodland,
    Lophostemon suaveolens, c. 10 km north west, and Grevillea glauca, c. 30 km north
    west). These sites were less rich in species, hence the wider search radius. Queensland
    Department of Environment and Resource Management issued a permit for work in
    Daintree and Girringun National Parks (permitWITK09188111). Several species near
    the border with Girringun National Park were collected on private land with permission
    from the owners Ross and Maxine Blennerhasset. New South Wales Office of Environment
    and Heritage issued a permit for work in Kosciuszko National Park (scientific
    license SL100517). Twigs of more than 100 species of trees and shrubs were collected
    in total, from three replicate individuals per species with a few exceptions stated
    below. None of the species were protected. Species in the rainforest were targeted
    using a dataset of twig wood density as a guide (dataset compiled by S.A. Stuart,
    unpublished). From tropical woodland and temperate forest approximately 30 of
    the most abundant species were collected, wood density was measured and species
    with mean density ranging from 0.38 to 0.62 g cm-3 were selected for further analysis.
    The lower density boundary was equal to the lowest-density measured across species
    sampled here. The higher cut-off was set so that each site was represented by
    at least ten species. This selection process resulted in the total of 68 species
    described here, spanning 48 genera and 26 families (S1 Table). One species, Pimelea
    linifolia, occurred in both the tropical woodland and the temperate forest. However,
    it was measured separately (three replicates per species per each site) and hence
    treated as two separate entities. Consequently, all the analyses were run on 69
    species-at-sites, which hereafter are referred to as '69 species'. Three individuals
    per species were sampled with the following exceptions, four individuals for Dysoxylum
    parasiticum and D. pettigrewianum, two individuals for Palaquium galactoxylum,
    one individual for Pouteria xerocarpa and Grevillea glauca. All species are evergreen
    except four deciduous trees from the rainforest site (Dysoxylum pettigrewianum,
    Ficus variegata, Palaquium galactoxylum and Wrightia laevis). Two rainforest species
    are pioneers (Leea indica and Mallotus paniculatus) and one species from the temperate
    woodland (Exocarpos strictus) is a hemi-parasitic shrub, parasitizing roots of
    neighbouring trees, at least in the early phases of life. Upper branches, one
    per individual plant, were collected and processed within 24 hours. A branch of
    approximately one meter length was divided into four main adjacent sections, using
    a wood diameter of c. 0.5 cm (under bark and excluding pith, i.e. the radius stretched
    from the outside of the pith to cambium) as a reference point. From the top of
    the branch the adjacent sections were as follows, 1) the segment above wood diameter
    of c. 0.5 cm for measurements of leaf area to sapwood area ratio, 2) a segment
    c. 10 cm long for anatomical measurements, 3) a segment c. 5 cm long for wood
    density measurement and 4) the remaining segment for mechanical tests detailed
    below. Occasionally, it was impossible to collect upper branches from tall canopy
    species (Eucalyptus and Corymbia species in the temperate forest and the tropical
    woodland). In those instances, shorter trees or lower branches were sampled.

- var_in: Specific leaf area (cm^2 g^-1)
  unit_in: cm2/g
  trait_name: leaf_mass_per_area
  entity_type: individual
  value_type: raw
  basis_of_value: measurement
  replicates: 1
  methods: Leaf traits were measured on leaves from twigs with wood diameter of c.
    0.5 cm (wood diameter measured under bark and excluding pith). For species with
    compound leaves, the rachis was included in measurements. For each replicate specific
    leaf area (SLA) was measured on at least seven simple leaves or one to two compound
    leaves. The number of replicates was as stated above except for two replicates
    for Xylomelum scottianum and Grevillea parallela from the tropical woodland. The
    leaves were placed in a sealed plastic bag within 24 hours from collection, and
    stored in a refrigerator for up to a week and a half. Next, they were positioned
    under transparent plexiglass and photographed (Pentax K100 DSuper, Pentax Ricoh
    Imaging Company, Japan). The photographs were enhanced in Photoshop and the total
    area of leaves was measured in Image-Pro Plus. After the photographs were taken
    the leaves were placed in paper bags and dried in a drying oven at 70 deg C for
    at least 72 hours. Leaf dry mass was then measured on a precision balance. SLA
    was calculated as mass of dried leaves divided by their leaf area.
- var_in: Leaf area to sapwood area ratio (cm^2 cm^-2)
  unit_in: cm2_leaf/cm2_sapwood
  trait_name: huber_value
  entity_type: individual
  value_type: raw
  basis_of_value: measurement
  replicates: 1
  methods: Leaf area to sapwood area ratio (LA/SA) was calculated for twigs with approximately
    0.5 cm of wood diameter (under bark and excluding pith). Two wood diameters perpendicular
    to each other were measured using digital calipers and sapwood area was calculated
    as an ellipse. The pith and bark were excluded from the measurement. All leaves
    from this segment, except for the ones used for SLA, were placed in paper bags
    and dried at 70 deg C for at least 72 hours. Next mass was measured on a precision
    balance, and the total leaf area on the shoot was calculated as SLA multiplied
    by the mass of all leaves. The total leaf area at wood diameter of 0.5cm was the
    sum of the area used for SLA and the remaining leaves. LA/SA was calculated by
    dividing the total area of leaves by the sapwood cross-sectional area calculated
    from the two diameters.
- var_in: MOE (MPa)
  unit_in: MPa
  trait_name: xylem_modulus_of_elasticity
  entity_type: individual
  value_type: raw
  basis_of_value: measurement
  replicates: 1
  methods: Mechanical measurements were carried out within two weeks of collection
    (the number of replicates was as stated above except for two replicates of Pimelea
    linifolia from the temperate forest, one replicate of P. linifolia from the tropical
    woodland and two replicates for Syzygium graveolens from the tropical rainforest).
    Between collection and testing, twigs were stored in sealed plastic bags in a
    cool room where available (4 deg C) or in an air conditioned room (around 20 deg
    C). A material testing machine (Model 5542, Instron Corporation, Canton, MA, USA)
    was used to carry out a three-point bending test. The segments used to measure
    modulus of elasticity (MOE) were at least 20 times longer than diameter (including
    bark and pith), as in previous studies on twigs. The 1:20 ratio of segment length
    to the diameter aimed to minimize the effect of shear stress on the compression
    and tensile stresses, the two principal components of modulus of elasticity.
- var_in: wood density (g cm^-1)
  unit_in: g/cm3
  trait_name: wood_density
  entity_type: individual
  value_type: raw
  basis_of_value: measurement
  replicates: 1
  methods: Wood density was measured on segments 3-5 cm long for each twig sample.
    Bark and pith were removed and measurements were carried out on xylem only. In
    this paper we refer to xylem as 'wood'. After removing bark and pith, wood pieces
    were soaked in water for at least 48 h prior to volume measurement. Then a beaker
    filled with water was placed on a balance (0.0001 g, Mettler AE 160). A thin wire
    platform was suspended in water so that it did not touch the side or bottom of
    the beaker. The balance was tared before each measurement and a sample was gently
    placed on the platform. The mass of displaced water was read from the balance.
    From standard water density of 1 g cm-3 and knowing the mass of displaced water,
    we calculated sample volumes applying Archimedes' buoyancy principle (e.g. 1 g
    of displaced water equals 1 cm3 volume). Samples were then placed in paper envelopes
    and dried at 70 deg C for at least 72 h. Wood density was calculated as the dry
    mass divided by water saturated volume (g cm-3).

- var_in: vessel_diameter
  unit_in: um
  trait_name: stem_vessel_diameter
  entity_type: individual
  value_type: raw
  basis_of_value: measurement
  replicates: 1
  methods: The anatomical traits measured were average cross-sectional area of vessel
    lumens (called here 'vessel area'), pith area, and the total fractions of cross-section
    contributed by each of vessel lumen, vessel wall, axial parenchyma, ray parenchyma
    (called 'rays' for short), fibre wall, fibre lumen, conduits with maximum lumen
    diameter below 15 um (see below), and mucilage canals (Fig 1A). Anatomical definitions
    followed 'IAWA list of microscopic features for hardwood identification' (IAWA
    Committee 1989). Traditionally angiosperm wood is referred to as a complex tissue
    composed of various cell types [16]. Nevertheless, the various cell types are
    called here 'tissues' for brevity and because they differ in morphology and functions.
    In addition to vessels, we established a category of conduits with maximum lumen
    diameter below 15 um (called hereafter conduits15um). These were cells with overall
    diameter in between or similar to that of small vessels and fibres. The walls
    resembled those of vessels in thickness, pit diameter, and distance between pits
    on circumference of the cell wall [36]. These cells would have been either tracheids
    or small vessels, however we were unable to confidently categorize them as one
    or the other from the cross-sections, hence the category conduits15um. In one
    species, Pimelea linifolia, cells that could have been either thin-walled fibres
    or axial parenchyma were observed. Those cells formed irregular patterns from
    a variable thickness band occurring off to one side of the pith to composing an
    entire growth ring. This morphology resembled that of a ground tissue. Wall thickness
    varied from that of fibres to that of axial parenchyma. Their diameters ranged
    from similar to fibres to as large as vessels. Nuclei and starch were not observed
    in these cells; pits and transverse walls were found only in a couple of cells.
    The transition between fibres and these cells within a growth ring was gradual
    and no clear cut-off was observed in wall thickness or cell diameter. However,
    a clearer difference between axial parenchyma cells associated with vessels and
    the problematic cells was noted, as the axial parenchyma had abundant simple pits
    and the problematic cells did not. Based on those observations, the problematic
    cells were counted as fibres. These cells might be an example of fibre dimorphism
    where parenchyma-like fibres or parenchyma could have originated from libriform
    fibres (fibres with small, slit-like pits) and the two cell types are similar
    in appearance [41]. The twigs were placed in FAA fixative (formalin to acetic
    acid to 70% ethanol in proportions 5 to 5 to 90; [42]) within 24 hours after collection.
    After four weeks the fixative was replaced with 70% ethanol. The ethanol solution
    was replaced twice more through the following week with the third change of ethanol
    serving as a storing medium. Before sectioning, samples were placed in 50% ethanol
    and kept in an oven for up to 72 hours at 40-50 deg C. This treatment helped to
    soften the wood. Cross-sections 10-50 um thick were cut using a sledge microtome
    (Reichert, Vienna, Austria) and disposable blades (model A35, Feather Safety Razor
    Co. Ltd, Japan). The sections were mounted in glycerol. High resolution photographs
    were taken at total 100x magnification using a Nikon digital camera (model DXM
    1200F, Nikon Corporation, Japan) mounted on a light microscope (Olympus BX 50F,
    Olympus Co. Ltd., Japan) and Nikon ACT-1 imaging software (version 2.62, Nikon
    Corporation, Japan). Each image had dimensions 3840 x 3072 pixels and was saved
    in tif format. One to two of the most representative radial sectors were chosen
    and photographed in a sequence from pith to bark. The sectors avoided tension
    wood where possible. Where the focus was uneven within a field of view, several
    photographs were taken at different focal lengths. These photographs were then
    stacked together in Photoshop CS4 (Adobe Systems Incorporated, USA). Next, the
    photographs capturing the whole radial sector were merged as a sequence resulting
    in one image of the whole sector. The sector analysed was bounded by pith, rays
    and bark. Vessel lumens were coloured in Photoshop and then measured in Image-Pro
    Plus version 2.0.0.260 (Media Cybernetics Inc., USA). Approximately 30 to 500
    vessels per replicate falling within a radial sector were measured. Protoxylem
    and newly produced vessels were excluded from measurements. To measure tissue
    fractions a grid of points 300 pixels (84.3 um) apart in horizontal and vertical
    directions was overlaid over the image of the radial sector (Fig 1B). A minimum
    300 points for each sample were analysed. Using Photoshop, each point was colour
    coded according to the tissue it fell into. Then image analysis software was used
    to count points, and to estimate tissue fractions (number of points of a given
    tissue divided by the total number of analysed points). The grid method has been
    used previously and is extensively discussed by Smith 1967 [43]; its modified
    version is applied here. Digital calipers were used to measure two perpendicular
    diameters of pith on freshly collected twigs, and then the area was calculated
    as an ellipse. Additional anatomical traits were calculated as follows. Total
    parenchyma fraction was the sum of axial and ray parenchyma (called here 'total
    parenchyma'). Total fibre fraction was the sum of fibre lumen and fibre wall fractions
    (called here 'total fibre'). The sum of fibre wall fraction and vessel wall fraction
    is called 'wallF+V fraction'. Also calculated were hydraulically weighted vessel
    diameter (DH), number of vessels per area (N), and the average vessel area to
    number of vessels per area ratio (S; also called 'vessel area to number ratio').
    DH was calculated from the mean diameters for individual vessels as DH = (Sdiameter5)/
    (Sdiameter4) [44]. N (mm-2) was calculated as vessel lumen fraction in the cross-section
    divided by arithmetic average of vessel lumen area (A, mm2). S was calculated
    as A divided by N (mm4; [14].

    After four weeks the fixative was replaced with 70% ethanol. The ethanol solution
    was replaced twice more through the following week with the third change of ethanol
    serving as a storing medium. Before sectioning, samples were placed in 50% ethanol
    and kept in an oven for up to 72 hours at 40-50 deg C. This treatment helped to
    soften the wood. Cross-sections 10-50 um thick were cut using a sledge microtome
    (Reichert, Vienna, Austria) and disposable blades (model A35, Feather Safety Razor
    Co. Ltd, Japan). The sections were mounted in glycerol. High resolution photographs
    were taken at total 100x magnification using a Nikon digital camera (model DXM
    1200F, Nikon Corporation, Japan) mounted on a light microscope (Olympus BX 50F,
    Olympus Co. Ltd., Japan) and Nikon ACT-1 imaging software (version 2.62, Nikon
    Corporation, Japan). Each image had dimensions 3840 x 3072 pixels and was saved
    in tif format. One to two of the most representative radial sectors were chosen
    and photographed in a sequence from pith to bark. The sectors avoided tension
    wood where possible. Where the focus was uneven within a field of view, several
    photographs were taken at different focal lengths. These photographs were then
    stacked together in Photoshop CS4 (Adobe Systems Incorporated, USA). Next, the
    photographs capturing the whole radial sector were merged as a sequence resulting
    in one image of the whole sector. The sector analysed was bounded by pith, rays
    and bark. Vessel lumens were coloured in Photoshop and then measured in Image-Pro
    Plus version 2.0.0.260 (Media Cybernetics Inc., USA). Approximately 30 to 500
    vessels per replicate falling within a radial sector were measured. Protoxylem
    and newly produced vessels were excluded from measurements. To measure tissue
    fractions a grid of points 300 pixels (84.3 um) apart in horizontal and vertical
    directions was overlaid over the image of the radial sector (Fig 1B). A minimum
    300 points for each sample were analysed. Using Photoshop, each point was colour
    coded according to the tissue it fell into. Then image analysis software was used
    to count points, and to estimate tissue fractions (number of points of a given
    tissue divided by the total number of analysed points). The grid method has been
    used previously and is extensively discussed by Smith 1967 [43]; its modified
    version is applied here. Digital calipers were used to measure two perpendicular
    diameters of pith on freshly collected twigs, and then the area was calculated
    as an ellipse. Additional anatomical traits were calculated as follows. Total
    parenchyma fraction was the sum of axial and ray parenchyma (called here 'total
    parenchyma'). Total fibre fraction was the sum of fibre lumen and fibre wall fractions
    (called here 'total fibre'). The sum of fibre wall fraction and vessel wall fraction
    is called 'wallF+V fraction'. Also calculated were hydraulically weighted vessel
    diameter (DH), number of vessels per area (N), and the average vessel area to
    number of vessels per area ratio (S; also called 'vessel area to number ratio').
    DH was calculated from the mean diameters for individual vessels as DH = (Sdiameter5)/
    (Sdiameter4) [44]. N (mm-2) was calculated as vessel lumen fraction in the cross-section
    divided by arithmetic average of vessel lumen area (A, mm2). S was calculated
    as A divided by N (mm4; [14].

  methods: The anatomical traits measured were average cross-sectional area of vessel
    lumens (called here 'vessel area'), pith area, and the total fractions of cross-section
    contributed by each of vessel lumen, vessel wall, axial parenchyma, ray parenchyma
    (called 'rays' for short), fibre wall, fibre lumen, conduits with maximum lumen
    diameter below 15 um (see below), and mucilage canals (Fig 1A). Anatomical definitions
    followed 'IAWA list of microscopic features for hardwood identification' (IAWA
    Committee 1989). Traditionally angiosperm wood is referred to as a complex tissue
    composed of various cell types [16]. Nevertheless, the various cell types are
    called here 'tissues' for brevity and because they differ in morphology and functions.
    In addition to vessels, we established a category of conduits with maximum lumen
    diameter below 15 um (called hereafter conduits15um). These were cells with overall
    diameter in between or similar to that of small vessels and fibres. The walls
    resembled those of vessels in thickness, pit diameter, and distance between pits
    on circumference of the cell wall [36]. These cells would have been either tracheids
    or small vessels, however we were unable to confidently categorize them as one
    or the other from the cross-sections, hence the category conduits15um. In one
    species, Pimelea linifolia, cells that could have been either thin-walled fibres
    or axial parenchyma were observed. Those cells formed irregular patterns from
    a variable thickness band occurring off to one side of the pith to composing an
    entire growth ring. This morphology resembled that of a ground tissue. Wall thickness
    varied from that of fibres to that of axial parenchyma. Their diameters ranged
    from similar to fibres to as large as vessels. Nuclei and starch were not observed
    in these cells; pits and transverse walls were found only in a couple of cells.
    The transition between fibres and these cells within a growth ring was gradual
    and no clear cut-off was observed in wall thickness or cell diameter. However,
    a clearer difference between axial parenchyma cells associated with vessels and
    the problematic cells was noted, as the axial parenchyma had abundant simple pits
    and the problematic cells did not. Based on those observations, the problematic
    cells were counted as fibres. These cells might be an example of fibre dimorphism
    where parenchyma-like fibres or parenchyma could have originated from libriform
    fibres (fibres with small, slit-like pits) and the two cell types are similar
    in appearance [41]. The twigs were placed in FAA fixative (formalin to acetic
    acid to 70% ethanol in proportions 5 to 5 to 90; [42]) within 24 hours after collection.

    composed of various cell types [16]. Nevertheless, the various cell types are
    called here 'tissues' for brevity and because they differ in morphology and functions.
    In addition to vessels, we established a category of conduits with maximum lumen
    diameter below 15 um (called hereafter conduits15um). These were cells with overall
    diameter in between or similar to that of small vessels and fibres. The walls
    resembled those of vessels in thickness, pit diameter, and distance between pits
    on circumference of the cell wall [36]. These cells would have been either tracheids
    or small vessels, however we were unable to confidently categorize them as one
    or the other from the cross-sections, hence the category conduits15um. In one
    species, Pimelea linifolia, cells that could have been either thin-walled fibres
    or axial parenchyma were observed. Those cells formed irregular patterns from
    a variable thickness band occurring off to one side of the pith to composing an
    entire growth ring. This morphology resembled that of a ground tissue. Wall thickness
    varied from that of fibres to that of axial parenchyma. Their diameters ranged
    from similar to fibres to as large as vessels. Nuclei and starch were not observed
    in these cells; pits and transverse walls were found only in a couple of cells.
    The transition between fibres and these cells within a growth ring was gradual
    and no clear cut-off was observed in wall thickness or cell diameter. However,
    a clearer difference between axial parenchyma cells associated with vessels and
    the problematic cells was noted, as the axial parenchyma had abundant simple pits
    and the problematic cells did not. Based on those observations, the problematic
    cells were counted as fibres. These cells might be an example of fibre dimorphism
    where parenchyma-like fibres or parenchyma could have originated from libriform
    fibres (fibres with small, slit-like pits) and the two cell types are similar
    in appearance [41]. The twigs were placed in FAA fixative (formalin to acetic
    acid to 70% ethanol in proportions 5 to 5 to 90; [42]) within 24 hours after collection.
    After four weeks the fixative was replaced with 70% ethanol. The ethanol solution
    was replaced twice more through the following week with the third change of ethanol
    serving as a storing medium. Before sectioning, samples were placed in 50% ethanol
    and kept in an oven for up to 72 hours at 40-50 deg C. This treatment helped to
    soften the wood. Cross-sections 10-50 um thick were cut using a sledge microtome
    (Reichert, Vienna, Austria) and disposable blades (model A35, Feather Safety Razor
    Co. Ltd, Japan). The sections were mounted in glycerol. High resolution photographs
    were taken at total 100x magnification using a Nikon digital camera (model DXM
    1200F, Nikon Corporation, Japan) mounted on a light microscope (Olympus BX 50F,
    Olympus Co. Ltd., Japan) and Nikon ACT-1 imaging software (version 2.62, Nikon
    Corporation, Japan). Each image had dimensions 3840 x 3072 pixels and was saved
    in tif format. One to two of the most representative radial sectors were chosen
    and photographed in a sequence from pith to bark. The sectors avoided tension
    wood where possible. Where the focus was uneven within a field of view, several
    photographs were taken at different focal lengths. These photographs were then
    stacked together in Photoshop CS4 (Adobe Systems Incorporated, USA). Next, the
    photographs capturing the whole radial sector were merged as a sequence resulting
    in one image of the whole sector. The sector analysed was bounded by pith, rays
    and bark. Vessel lumens were coloured in Photoshop and then measured in Image-Pro
    Plus version 2.0.0.260 (Media Cybernetics Inc., USA). Approximately 30 to 500
    vessels per replicate falling within a radial sector were measured. Protoxylem
    and newly produced vessels were excluded from measurements. To measure tissue
    fractions a grid of points 300 pixels (84.3 um) apart in horizontal and vertical
    directions was overlaid over the image of the radial sector (Fig 1B). A minimum
    300 points for each sample were analysed. Using Photoshop, each point was colour
    coded according to the tissue it fell into. Then image analysis software was used
    to count points, and to estimate tissue fractions (number of points of a given
    tissue divided by the total number of analysed points). The grid method has been
    used previously and is extensively discussed by Smith 1967 [43]; its modified
    version is applied here. Digital calipers were used to measure two perpendicular
    diameters of pith on freshly collected twigs, and then the area was calculated
    as an ellipse. Additional anatomical traits were calculated as follows. Total
    parenchyma fraction was the sum of axial and ray parenchyma (called here 'total
    parenchyma'). Total fibre fraction was the sum of fibre lumen and fibre wall fractions
    (called here 'total fibre'). The sum of fibre wall fraction and vessel wall fraction
    is called 'wallF+V fraction'. Also calculated were hydraulically weighted vessel
    diameter (DH), number of vessels per area (N), and the average vessel area to
    number of vessels per area ratio (S; also called 'vessel area to number ratio').
    DH was calculated from the mean diameters for individual vessels as DH = (Sdiameter5)/
    (Sdiameter4) [44]. N (mm-2) was calculated as vessel lumen fraction in the cross-section
    divided by arithmetic average of vessel lumen area (A, mm2). S was calculated
    as A divided by N (mm4; [14].
