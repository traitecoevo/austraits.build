  description: Seed mass data for Sydney species
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: Within Australia sclerophyll and mesophyll vegetation types are
    often found close together, under the same climate but on different soils. It
    is well established that sclerophylly is a response to low soil nutrients (Beadle
    1954, 1966). Thus fertile-soil sites could readily be distinguished from infertile-soil
    sites by the physiognomy of the vegetation, as well as by the geomorphology. Total
    soil phosphorus is typically used as the best single indicator of soil fertility
    (Bowen 1981, Williams and Raupach 1983), because it is a limiting macronutrient
    and is not very soluble, and atmospheric inputs are small. Samples of the top
    20 cm of soil were collected from five random locations at each site, bulked,
    and analyzed for total soil phosphorus by standard methods (Lambert 1983). For
    statistical power it was more important that each study site should include comparable
    numbers of species than that they should be of the same area. Our aim at each
    site was to sample a contiguous area including 50-100 species. We began with a
    sample area 50 x 20 m (0.1 ha), which as expected (Rice and Westoby 1983) proved
    sufficient to obtain >50 species at all the infertile sites, and also at sites
    2 and 4. At site 1 we expanded the area to 0.2 ha. At site 3 we felt an expanded
    site would have been more heterogeneous than was desirable, so we left it at 0.1
    ha and 42 species. Each site was visited repeatedly from mid-1983 to late 1984,
    to make an initial list of species, to search for species that had been missed
    initially, and to collect ripe fruits of each species. In some instances fruit
    had to be collected from locations other than the study sites. For a few species
    we never acquired fruits. Between September and November of 1984 we estimated
    percentage canopy cover of different species at each site by means of >20 m of
    line intercept, distributed systematically over the site. This sampling was done
    during austral spring, but since the vegetation is overwhelmingly perennial and
    evergreen, season should make little difference.

    description: We selected eight sites in national parks or state forests around
      the northern and southern suburbs of Sydney, Australia, -34 deg S, 151 deg  E.
      Substantial areas of natural vegetation on infertile sandstone are conserved
      around Sydney, but most fertile soils were cleared quite early during European
      colonization. Only small patches of fertile-soil vegetation remain, usually
      within large areas of infertile Hawkesbury Sandstone. We were able to distribute
      our four fertile sites over three substrate types. Sites on infertile soil were
      then chosen to be interspersed with the fertile sites (Fig. 1), and to include
      both woodland and heathland vegetation, even though Rice and Westoby (1981)
      had found no evidence vegetation structure affected the incidence of dispersal
      by ants among infertile-soil vegetation types. Northernmost sites locations
      in Kuring'gai National Park and southernmost sites in Royal National Park. See
      Westoby et al. 1990 for map of site locations.

  methods: Where possible, we collected ripe diaspores from several plants at each
    site where a species occurred. At least five diaspores were weighed for each species,
    spread over plants and sites if possible. Fleshy fruits were weighed fresh promptly,
    after storing refrigerated for a few days, or after storing frozen in sealed containers
    for a longer period. They were subsequently dried at 80 deg C and weighed again.
    Another fresh diaspore was chosen from the midrange of sizes indicated by the
    weighings and was dissected into three components, embryo plus endosperm; "dispersal
    structure," meaning any wing, food body, etc.; and the remainder, including the
    testa and other tissues surrounding embryo and endosperm. These three components
    were weighed both fresh and dry to estimate the percentage each contributed to
    a typical diaspore. In many cases > 1 diaspore was dissected quantitatively, and
    in all cases further diaspores were cut apart to confirm that the one dissected
    quantitatively was not atypical internally. In the case of berries, aggregate
    fruits, and drupaceous fruits, with several seeds included within one body of
    flesh, the seeds in each of five diaspores were counted. The amount of flesh can
    therefore be expressed either on a per-diaspore or on a per-embryo basis. Measurements
    of mass were made using a Cahn microbalance to microgram precision. In the case
    of orchid seeds and fern spores it was not possible to weigh or dissect individuals,
    and an average mass for whole diaspores was obtained from weighing a group.
