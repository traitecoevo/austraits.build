  sampling_strategy: Within Australia sclerophyll and mesophyll vegetation types are often found close together, under the same climate but on different soils. It is well established that sclerophylly is a response to low soil nutrients (Beadle 1954, 1966). Thus fertile-soil sites could readily be distinguished from infertile-soil sites by the physiognomy of the vegetation, as well as by the geomorphology. Total soil phosphorus is typically used as the best single indicator of soil fertility (Bowen 1981, Williams and Raupach 1983), because it is a limiting macronutrient and is not very soluble, and atmospheric inputs are small. Samples of the top 20 cm of soil were collected from five random locations at each site, bulked, and analyzed for total soil phosphorus by standard methods (Lambert 1983). For statistical power it was more important that each study site should include comparable numbers of species than that they should be of the same area. Our aim at each site was to sample a contiguous area including 50-100 species. We began with a sample area 50 x 20 m (0.1 ha), which as expected (Rice and Westoby 1983) proved sufficient to obtain >50 species at all the infertile sites, and also at sites 2 and 4. At site 1 we expanded the area to 0.2 ha. At site 3 we felt an expanded site would have been more heterogeneous than was desirable, so we left it at 0.1 ha and 42 species. Each site was visited repeatedly from mid-1983 to late 1984, to make an initial list of species, to search for species that had been missed initially, and to collect ripe fruits of each species. In some instances fruit had to be collected from locations other than the study sites. For a few species we never acquired fruits. Between September and November of 1984 we estimated percentage canopy cover of different species at each site by means of >20 m of line intercept, distributed systematically over the site. This sampling was done during austral spring, but since the vegetation is overwhelmingly perennial and evergreen, season should make little difference.

    description: We selected eight sites in national parks or state forests around the northern and southern suburbs of Sydney, Australia, 334° S, 151° E. Substantial areas of natural vegetation on infertile sandstone are conserved around Sydney, but most fertile soils were cleared quite early during European colonization. Only small patches of fertile-soil vegetation remain, usually within large areas of infertile Hawkesbury Sandstone. We were able to distribute our four fertile sites over three substrate types. Sites on infertile soil were then chosen to be interspersed with the fertile sites (Fig. 1), and to include both woodland and heathland vegetation, even though Rice and Westoby (1981) had found no evidence vegetation structure affected the incidence of dispersal by ants among infertile-soil vegetation types. Northernmost sites locations in Kuring'gai National Park and southernmost sites in Royal National Park. See Westoby et al. 1990 for map of site locations.

  methods: Where possible, we collected ripe diaspores from several plants at each site where a species occurred. At least five diaspores were weighed for each species, spread over plants and sites if possible. Fleshy fruits were weighed fresh promptly, after storing refrigerated for a few days, or after storing frozen in sealed containers for a longer period. They were subsequently dried at 80°C and weighed again. Another fresh diaspore was chosen from the midrange of sizes indicated by the weighings and was dissected into three components, embryo plus endosperm; "dispersal structure," meaning any wing, food body, etc.; and the remainder, including the testa and other tissues surrounding embryo and endosperm. These three components were weighed both fresh and dry to estimate the percentage each contributed to a typical diaspore. In many cases > 1 diaspore was dissected quantitatively, and in all cases further diaspores were cut apart to confirm that the one dissected quantitatively was not atypical internally. In the case of berries, aggregate fruits, and drupaceous fruits, with several seeds included within one body of flesh, the seeds in each of five diaspores were counted. The amount of flesh can therefore be expressed either on a per-diaspore or on a per-embryo basis. Measurements of mass were made using a Cahn microbalance to microgram precision. In the case of orchid seeds and fern spores it was not possible to weigh or dissect individuals, and an average mass for whole diaspores was obtained from weighing a group.
