  description: data on bud reprouting following disturbance in semi-arid NSW
  collection_type: field_experiment
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: In this paper we use a function regression model, with a hurdle
    component, to analyse data from a field experiment of clipping and burning across
    42 plant species from semi-arid NSW, Australia. We aim to model the probability
    of resprouting and the depth distribution of sprouts (buds, conditional on successful
    resprouting) in each species. We aimed to address four questions. First, do populations
    of sprouts differ in number and depth among growth forms? Second, does clipping
    allow some sprouts to emerge from above ground or at shallower depths than a combined
    clipping and burning treatment? Third, are species' traits associated with the
    probability of resprouting or distribution of sprout depths? Fourth, are associations
    between traits and sprout depths coordinated with associations with the probability
    of resprouting? We classified species into four growth forms (forbs, grasses,
    chenopod subshrubs and woody plants) and characterised species on the basis of
    three functional traits  (maximum plant height, mean number of stems and specific
    leaf area). ^p Sampled species were common perennials that had individuals shorter
    than 1.5 m tall, which may be exposed to browsing and fire. In total, 46 species
    were treated, with 10 monocots (hereafter grasses), 11 forbs, 8 sub-shrubs from
    the Chenopodiaceae and 17 woody shrubs and trees. We excluded four species from
    the present analysis due to incomplete trait data (species list included with
    trait data at https://github.com/jdyen/sprouts) ^p  Experimental treatments, There
    were 10 replicates in each of control, clip, and clip-and-burn (hereafter, burn)
    treatments; the controls were not used in this paper. Clipping used secateurs
    or a hand saw for large, woody individuals and was aimed at 5 mm above ground.
    The burning treatment was applied with a hand-held butane gas torch at standard
    flame length and 10 cm distance from the plant, constantly moving over a 10 cm
    x 10 cm area over 2 min, resulting in average temperatures of 71 deg C at 5 mm
    depth (see Vesk et al., 2004). Plants were treated over 6-15 June 2000 and scored
    for resprouting October 5-10, 2000, and again March 26-30, 2001 for woody species
    with low resprouting proportions at the first visit. PA Vesk dug up at least three
    haphazardly chosen individuals that resprouted and counted the number of sprouts
    visible to the naked eye and recorded the depth belowground from which the sprouts
    emerged from the stem or roots. Above-ground sprouts had negative depths recorded.
    Most plants were dug up in entirety, some deeper rooted woody plant were dug out
    to greater depth, typically no greater than 15 cm. Nine species (two chenopods,
    three forbs and 4 woodies) that showed either sprouting proportions close to one-half,
    or that had much fewer plants resprout after burning than to clipping (see Supplement)
    were subjected to a repeat of the experiment (but with new individuals) March
    26-31, 2001 and revisited August 15-16 and November 21-23, 2001. As a result,
    there were more individuals available for some species. Plants that did not resprout
    were not examined for sprouts, but they contributed to the analysis of resprouting
    success.

    longitude (deg): 146.161
    MAP (mm): 370
    average summer temp (C): 32.5
    average winter temp (C): 14.2
    soil: loamy red sands light red clays and light red browns earths
    vegetation types: predominantly open Callitris glaucophylla - Eucalyptus populnea
      woodland and Eucalyptus dumosa - E. socialis shrub mallee woodland
    fire frequency: 5-20 years
    details: A clip-and-burn experiment was conducted in the field on 46 species of
      plants across 4 growth forms in order to score resprouting success (see Vesk
      et al., 2004 for details). We included 42 of these species in the present analysis.
      The experiment took place in Round Hill-Nombinnie Nature Reserve, central NSW,
      Australia (-32.965, 146.161). The climate in this region is warm and semi-arid.
      At the nearest meteorological station (Mt. Hope), median annual rainfall is
      370 mm and mean daily maximum temperatures range from 14.2 deg C in winter to
      32.5 deg C in summer. Land systems comprised low hills, plains and dunefields.
      Soils included loamy red sands light red clays and light red browns earths.
      Vegetation types were predominantly open Callitris glaucophylla - Eucalyptus
      populnea woodland and Eucalyptus dumosa - E. socialis shrub mallee woodland
      (Cohn, 1995). Both open woodland and mallee woodland experience wildfire roughly
      on 5-20 year frequency. In mallee fires all growth forms tend to experience
      total leaf scorch, whereas mature trees of open C. glaucophylla - E. populnea
      woodland may escape leaf scorch. There is light to moderate browsing by Western
      Grey kangaroos, Macropus fuliginosus, and feral goats, Capra hircus.

  methods: These are sprouts that were observed on successfully resprouting individuals
    that had experienced experimental clipping and burning treatments. PA Vesk dug
    up at least three haphazardly chosen individuals that resprouted and counted the
    number of sprouts visible to the naked eye and recorded the depth belowground
    from which the sprouts emerged from the stem or roots. Above-ground sprouts had
    negative depths recorded. Most plants were dug up in entirety, some deeper rooted
    woody plant were dug out to greater depth, typically no greater than 15 cm. Nine
