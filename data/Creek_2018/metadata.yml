  description: A study examining the interaction between gas exchange and hydraulic
    function in the leaves, stems and roots of three semiarid evergreen species exposed
    to a cycle of severe water stress (associated with substantial cavitation) and
    recovery.
  basis_of_record: captive_cultivated
  life_stage: sapling
  sampling_strategy: Seed of each species was sourced from the Australian Tree Seed
    Centre (CSIRO, Black Mountain, ACT), from populations in central-northwest NSW.
    The climate in these environments is characterized by high summer temperatures
    (mean maximum approximately 28 °C) and low sporadic rainfall (approximately 300
    mm). In September 2015, seeds were germinated and grown in tubestock inside a
    polytunnel managed by Greening Australia (Richmond, NSW). After 2-3 months, 50
    plants of each species were transplanted into larger cylindrical polyvinyl chloride
    (PVC) pots (6.9 L; 15-cm diameter by 40-cm length, with the bottom of each pot
    consisting of a PVC cap with six 4-mm-wide drainage holes) filled with a local
    native soil obtained from the A horizon of a local dry sclerophyllous forest in
    Menangle, NSW, Australia. The soil was a moderately fertile sandy loam - pH =
    5.0 (0.01 M CaCl), organic carbon content = 1.4%, total Kjeldahl N = 1,300 mg
    kg-1, total p = 217 mg kg-1, C:N:P = 65:6:1 (ALS Laboratory Group, Smithfield,
    NSW, Australia). The pots were placed onto benches in three naturally lit, adjacent,
    and temperature-controlled glasshouse bays that have been described previously
    (Ghannoum et al., 2010; Lewis et al., 2013) located at the Western Sydney University
    Hawkesbury campus, Richmond, NSW. Photosynthetically active radiation is approximately
    15% lower inside the glasshouse bays compared with outside conditions. The air
    temperature in each bay was controlled at two set points over a day-night cycle
    at 22 °C from 8:00 to 18:00 hr (day) and 18 °C from 20:00 to 06:00 hr (night)
    and with a progressive temperature increase/decrease between the day/night set
    values. Plants were grown for 3-4 months and kept well-watered and fertilized
    every 3 weeks with a commercial liquid fertilizer (500 ml Aquasol, at 1.6 g l
    - 1; 23% N, 4% P, 18% K, 0.05% Zn, 0.06% Cu, 0.0013% Mo, 0.15% Mn, 0.06% Fe, 0.011%
    B; Yates Australia, Padstow, NSW, Australia). ^p In April 2016, when the plants
    of each species were at least 50 cm tall, we assigned plants to two different
    subexperiments. (a) Drought response experiment - a group of 15-20 plants per
    species were exposed to a single drought treatment during which the response of
    leaf gas exchange and hydraulic conductance in leaves, stems, and roots to decreasing
    water potential was measured. (b) Recovery response experiment - immediately following
    the completion of Experiment 1, a second group of 15-20 plants per species were
    dried down to a narrow range of water potentials associated with significant stem
    hydraulic dysfunction and then rewatered to field capacity after which the recovery
    of leaf gas exchange and hydraulic traits was measured. In both experiments, the
    rate of plant desiccation during drought was slowed by shading the plants from
    afternoon sun with 50% shade cloth and covering the exposed soil of each pot to
    prevent soil water evaporation. Plants in the second experiment were also maintained
    under these conditions during recovery. Note that all gas exchange measurements
    were conducted during the morning under nonshaded light conditions. ^p Experiment
    1 - Drought response ^p In the drought response experiment, all plants were exposed
    to drought by withholding water, after which they were allowed to use up available
    soil water and slowly desiccate (over the course of 2-3 weeks). During this time,
    the physiological response of each species was monitored. As the drought progressed,
    individual plants were targeted for leaf gas exchange, whole canopy transpiration,
    and midday water potential (measured in situ) and then taken out of the glasshouse
    and harvested for leaf, stem, and root hydraulic measurements in the lab. In total,
    the physiological response of plants of each species was measured across all levels
    of plant water status (water potential), ranging from full hydration to near complete
    canopy leaf death. ^p Experiment 2 - Recovery response ^p To characterize the
    recovery of plant function following drought, plants of each species were dried
    down to a target minimum water potential associated with approximately 50% loss
    in stem hydraulic conductance (as predicted from each species vulnerability curve
    generated from Experiment 1), after which they were rewatered and soil water content
    was maintained at field capacity. During recovery, leaf-level gas exchange and
    whole canopy transpiration, as well as leaf, stem, and root hydraulics were measured
    in subgroups of 4-5 plants per species at 1, 3, 14, and 28 days after soil rewetting.
    A smaller group of control plants (n = 3) per species were maintained under well-watered
    conditions throughout the experiment. ^p To avoid the potentially confounding
    effect of altered canopy leaf area on the recovery dynamics, we limited the extent
    of leaf death in the recovery response plants at peak drought stress, whilst still
    ensuring water potentials associated with approximately 50% stem hydraulic dysfunction
    were reached. The average percentage of canopy leaf area that was dead due to
    drought was 0% in A. aneura, 5.9 ± 2.1% in E. populnea, and 9.2 ± 3.1% in E. coolabah.

  methods: Leaves that had been measured for gas exchange (one per individual) were
    excised at midday and placed in a humidified plastic bag inside a cooler box and
    transported to the lab where leaf water potential (Psileaf) was measured using
    a Scholander-type pressure chamber (Model 1505D, PMS Instrument Company, Albany,
    OR, USA). Meanwhile, an opaque plastic bag was placed over the entire shoot component
    of each of the targeted individual and whole plants (with pots) were transported
    to the lab, where they were left for a minimum of 1 hr in darkness to facilitate
    water potential equilibration across plant tissues, before starting leaf, stem,
    and root hydraulic measurements (see detailed description below). To ensure that
    we had confidence in the response of photosynthesis and stomatal conductance during
    the drydown phase, we measured gas exchange, E, and midday Psileaf in a number
    of additional plants to those targeted for hydraulics. ^p Hydraulic measurements
    ^p Leaf hydraulic conductance was measured using the modified rehydration kinetics
    technique (Brodribb & Cochard, 2009). After whole plants had spent a minimum of
    1 hr inside opaque plastic bags, water potential equilibration was tested by measuring
    2-3 leaves sampled from different parts of the canopy (for each individual, water
    potential did not vary by more than 10%). Focusing on one individual at a time,
    each plant was removed from the plastic bag, and a target leaf (or small shoot
    in the case of A. aneura) was cut under water. The leaf was quickly attached to
    hydraulic tubing connected to a beaker of water placed on a high precision balance,
    which recorded the rate of water uptake by the leaf every 2 s. The head of water
    on the balance was at the same height as the leaf to eliminate the influence of
    gravity, and a release valve was connected to ensure zero pressure in the tubing
    upon leaf connection. Kleaf was determined at the instantaneous point corresponding
    to the initial water potential Psileaf recorded at the time of leaf excision using
    the following equation -- Kleaf = -I/Al*Psileaf, where I is the maximum flow rate
    (mmol s-1) calculated from the first 3-4 datapoints of the rehydration curve,
    and Al is the leaf area (m-2). Measurements of Kleaf during the recovery response
    experiment were conducted within the glasshouse prior to placing whole plants
    into bags at midday (following transpiration measurements), which ensured there
    was sufficient pressure inside the leaf to detect flow rates using the balance.
    In this instance, the water potential was measured in two leaves (neighbouring
    the sample leaf) to ensure accuracy in our determination of initial water potential.
    In all cases, the water potential measured in these two neighbouring leaves did
    not differ by more than 10%. ^p For each species, the relationship between hydraulic
    conductance of each plant organ and decreasing water potential (-MPa) was fitted
    with a Weibull curve using the "fitcond" function in the fitplc package in R (Duursma
    & Choat, 2017). From these curves, the water potential corresponding to 12, 50,
    and 88 PLC from mean maximum values was calculated. In each case, where possible,
    bootstrapped confidence intervals (CIs; 95%) were calculated.

    following excision of the root portion of the plant, the cut stem of the entire
    above ground portion was kept under water in a humidified dark bag for a further
    20-60 min to ensure relaxation of the xylem tension within the stem and avoid
    possible excision artefacts (Torres-Ruiz et al., 2015; Wheeler, Huggett, Tofte,
    Rockwell, & Holbrook, 2013). This was especially important for dehydrated plants
    in the drought response experiment. Once xylem water potential was >-1 MPa, which
    was determined by measuring water potential in 2-3 leaves sampled from different
    parts of the plant, the whole shoot was progressively and slowly cut back under
    water (~5-10 min between each cut) until a straight, unbranched stem segment approximately
    10 cm in length was obtained. Leaves from these sections were later removed for
    determination of total canopy leaf area. Stem hydraulic conductivity measurements
    were made before and after removal of embolism, with flow rates logged with a
    digital liquid flow meter (LiquiFlow L10, Bronkhorst High-Tech BV, Ruurlo, Gelderland,
    Netherlands) using a filtered (0.22 um) solution of distilled water with 2 mmol
    KCl and flow analysis programs FlowDDE (V. 4.69) and FlowPlot (Versions 4.69 and
    3.34, respectively, Bronkhorst FlowWare, http://downloads.bronhorst.com). Embolism
    was removed by flushing the stem for a minimum of 30 min at constant low pressure
    (0.2 MPa). The relative difference in flow (percent loss of conductivity [PLC])
    before and after repeated flushing at high pressure was plotted against stem Psi
    to create stem hydraulic vulnerability curves. ^p For each species, the relationship

    vulnerability of roots was measured using the same principles of rehydration kinetics,
    whereby intact root systems absorbed water while connected to a reservoir of water
    placed on an analytical balance. Immediately following the leaf hydraulic measurement,
    targeted plants (still in their pots) were put on their side and the above-ground
    shoot component lowered inside a large open-topped plastic box accessed via a
    2-cm-wide vertical slit that had been cut-out from the top of one of the end walls
    (see schematic diagram Figure S2). The bottom of the cut-out space, containing
    the base of the stem, was then sealed with water-proof tape and the box filled
    with enough water to submerge the base of the stem. Sharp secateurs were used
    to cut the stem within the first 2 cm of its length entering the box, after which
    the end section that was still attached to the roots was immediately connected
    to hydraulic tubing leading to a beaker of water placed on a balance (as described
    for leaf hydraulics above). The maximum rate of water flow into the root system
    was calculated from the first 3-4 datapoints (i.e., the first 6-8 s) of each rehydration
    curve. Root hydraulic conductance (Kroot mmol s-1 m-2 MPa) was normalized by whole
    canopy leaf area, initial water potential, and water viscosity. We expressed Kroot
    on a leaf area basis, rather than a root mass basis, to facilitate direct comparisons
    between leaf and root hydraulic fluxes. ^p For each species, the relationship
    between hydraulic conductance of each plant organ and decreasing water potential
    (-MPa) was fitted with a Weibull curve using the "fitcond" function in the fitplc

  methods: Meanwhile, an opaque plastic bag was placed over the entire shoot component
    of each of the targeted individual and whole plants (with pots) were transported
    to the lab, where they were left for a minimum of 1 hr in darkness to facilitate
    water potential equilibration across plant tissues, before starting leaf, stem,
    and root hydraulic measurements (see detailed description below). ^p The hydraulic
    vulnerability of roots was measured using the same principles of rehydration kinetics,
    whereby intact root systems absorbed water while connected to a reservoir of water
    placed on an analytical balance. Immediately following the leaf hydraulic measurement,
    targeted plants (still in their pots) were put on their side and the above-ground
    shoot component lowered inside a large open-topped plastic box accessed via a
    2-cm-wide vertical slit that had been cut-out from the top of one of the end walls
    (see schematic diagram Figure S2). The bottom of the cut-out space, containing
    the base of the stem, was then sealed with water-proof tape and the box filled
    with enough water to submerge the base of the stem. Sharp secateurs were used
    to cut the stem within the first 2 cm of its length entering the box, after which
    the end section that was still attached to the roots was immediately connected
    to hydraulic tubing leading to a beaker of water placed on a balance (as described
    for leaf hydraulics above). The maximum rate of water flow into the root system
    was calculated from the first 3-4 datapoints (i.e., the first 6-8 s) of each rehydration
    curve. Root hydraulic conductance (Kroot mmol s-1 m-2 MPa) was normalized by whole
    canopy leaf area, initial water potential, and water viscosity. We expressed Kroot
    on a leaf area basis, rather than a root mass basis, to facilitate direct comparisons
    between leaf and root hydraulic fluxes. ^p For each species, the relationship
    between hydraulic conductance of each plant organ and decreasing water potential
    (-MPa) was fitted with a Weibull curve using the "fitcond" function in the fitplc
    package in R (Duursma & Choat, 2017). From these curves, the water potential corresponding
    to 12, 50, and 88 PLC from mean maximum values was calculated. In each case, where
    possible, bootstrapped confidence intervals (CIs; 95%) were calculated.

  methods: Photosynthesis at 80% stomatal closure (A80); Leaf gas exchange, canopy transpiration, and water potential ^p In both
    the drought response and recovery experiments, we measured leaf-level photosynthesis
    during the morning (9:00-12:00 hr) using up to four identical open gas exchange
    systems (Li-6400XT with Li-6400-02B LED light source, Li-Cor Inc.). One fully
    expanded leaf, considered to be representative of the condition of the majority
    of mature leaves, was enclosed in the cuvette and exposed to ambient light (1,000
    umol m-2 s-1), 400 umol mol-1 CO2, and a flow rate of 500 umol s-1. The leaf vapour-pressure
    deficit during each measurement was maintained between 0.9 and 1.4 kPa, and the
    leaf temperature was controlled at 22 ± 1 °C. ^p Leaves that had been measured
    for gas exchange (one per individual) were excised at midday and placed in a humidified
    plastic bag inside a cooler box and transported to the lab where leaf water potential
    (Psileaf) was measured using a Scholander-type pressure chamber (Model 1505D,
    PMS Instrument Company, Albany, OR, USA). Meanwhile, an opaque plastic bag was

    of photosynthesis and stomatal conductance during the drydown phase, we measured
    gas exchange, E, and midday Psileaf in a number of additional plants to those
    targeted for hydraulics. ^p Statistics ^p For each species, the response of leaf
    gas exchange to increasing water potential was parameterized using local polynomial
    regression and fitting a "loess" model in conjunction with the "fitcond" function
    in the fitplc package in R (Duursma & Choat, 2017). The resulting fit was used
    to calculate the water potential at 80% stomatal closure (gs80). It was also used
    to test whether leaf gas exchange was limited by water potential during recovery.

    deficit during each measurement was maintained between 0.9 and 1.4 kPa, and the
    leaf temperature was controlled at 22 ± 1 °C. ^p Each day, immediately following
    gas exchange measurements, the pots of targeted plants were placed inside 1-mm-thick
    plastic bags and sealed with zip ties at the base of the plant stem. Pots were
    then weighed on a precision high capacity balance (model FCB 15 K0.1BM, Kern,
    Balingen, Germany) at approximately 11:00 and 12:00 hr. Whole canopy transpiration
    (E, mmol m-2 s-1) was calculated from these measurements as the difference in
    pot mass (g) divided by the time (s) between measurements and whole plant leaf
    area (m2). In the drought response experiment, total canopy leaf area was determined
    for each plant after they were destructively harvested for hydraulic measurements
    (Li-3100C Area Meter, Li-Cor Inc., Lincoln, NE, USA). During recovery in the recovery
    response experiment, E was normalized for each plant by its original leaf area
    (i.e., the leaf area that would have been present immediately prior to the onset
    of drought). This original leaf area was estimated using measurements of stem
    basal diameter taken prior to the onset of drought and the allometric relationship
    between basal diameter and canopy leaf area generated for each species from the
    15-20 plants that were harvested during the drought response experiment. Basal
    stem diameter was measured using a portable high-precision laser micrometer (Metralight,
    San Mateo, CA, USA) mounted onto a modified piece of clear PVC sheet marked with
    a series of parallel and perpendicular lines. Pots were marked with two points
    90° apart that were used to align the micrometre with the base of the main stem
    for each measurement. For each species, the relationship between stem diameter
    and canopy leaf area was significant at p ≤ 0.05 (see Figure S1). ^p Leaves that
    had been measured for gas exchange (one per individual) were excised at midday
    and placed in a humidified plastic bag inside a cooler box and transported to
    the lab where leaf water potential (Psileaf) was measured using a Scholander-type
    pressure chamber (Model 1505D, PMS Instrument Company, Albany, OR, USA). Meanwhile,
