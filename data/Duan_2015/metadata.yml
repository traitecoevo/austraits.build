  description: 'Water relations and carbon dynamics were examined in two species with
    contrasting stomatal regulation strategies: Pinus radiata D. Don (relatively isohydric
    gymnosperm; regulating stomata to maintain leaf water potential above critical
    thresholds; data not included in AusTraits) and Callitris rhomboidea R. Br (relatively
    anisohydric gymnosperm; allowing leaf water potential to decline as the soil dries),
    to assess response to drought as a function of [CO2] and temperature.'

  sampling_strategy: "Experimental design Three-month-old seedlings of P. radiata
    (Pinaceae family) and C. rhomboidea (Cupressaceae family) raised in forestry tube
    stock were obtained from Greening Australia (Sydney) on 13 January 2012. Thereafter,
    seedlings of each species were transplanted from tube stocks into 80 PVC pots
    (15 cm diameter x 40 cm height) containing ~10 kg air-dried, native loamy sand
    soil (86.5% sand, 9.5% clay and 4% silt). Pots contained drainage holes at the
    bottom to prevent soil waterlogging. Twenty seedlings of each species were then
    randomly placed in each of the four adjacent, naturally sun-lit and C/T-controlled
    glasshouse compartments (each 3 m (width) x 5 m (length) x 3.5 m (height)), located
    at the University of Western Sydney (Richmond, NSW, Australia (33deg 36'40''S,
    150deg 44'26.5''E)). Prior to the drought treatment, seedlings were watered
    daily to field capacity and fertilized on two occasions (17 February and 19 March)
    with a commercial fertilizer (N:P:K- 27:2:10; All Purpose, Brunnings, Oakleigh
    South, VIC, Australia). Seedlings were rotated regularly within and between glasshouse
    compartments to minimize potential effects of glasshouse compartments on plant
    performance. Details of glasshouse design can be found in Ghannoum et al. (2010).
    In summary, two glasshouse compartments for Ta treatments were set to simulate
    the 30-year daily average temperature in the growing season (November-May) experienced
    in Richmond, NSW. Over the course of 24 h, T was changed five times to simulate
    diurnal temperature cycles in the field. An additional two glasshouse compartments
    assigned to the Te treatments were designed to simulate a constant 4 deg C increase
    in temperature relative to ambient daily temperature cycle. The mean growth temperatures
    for Ta and Te were 26/16 and 30/20 deg C (day/night), respectively. For the two
    compartments within each T treatment, [CO2] was automatically regulated to maintain
    ambient (target 400 ul l-1) and elevated (target 640 ul l-1) C, respectively.
    Ce was achieved by injecting CO2 gas (Food grade, AirLiquide, Fairfield, NSW,
    Australia) from pressurized cylinders through solenoid valves connected to a CO2
    monitor/controller (Lambda T, ADC BioScientific Ltd, Hoddesdon, Herts, UK). The
    target C and T were continuously monitored through the day and were intended to
    reflect the projected climate scenarios by the end of 21st century (IPCC 2012,
    Franks et al. 2013). The four treatments were termed as follows: CaTa (400 ul
    l-1, 26 deg C), CaTe (400 ul l-1, 30 deg C), CeTa (640 ul l-1, 26 deg C) and CeTe
    (640 ul l-1, 30 deg C). According to the primary research objective, we did not
    separate temperature and VPD effects in this study. Therefore, during the experimental
    period, VPD was not maintained constant among C and T treatments, reflecting a
    realistic scenario for future warmer climates. The diurnal VPD varied between
    0.1 and 2.9 kPa in Ta treatments (mean value: 0.86 +/- 0.01 kPa) and between 0.2
    and 4.3 kPa in Te treatments (mean value: 1.50 +/- 0.01 kPa). VPD did not vary
    between C treatments. Drought treatment After 2 months of growth in the C and
    T treatments, half of the seedlings (i.e., 10 seedlings) within each species were
    randomly assigned to one of the two water treatments (i.e., wellwatered or drought)
    in each of the four C and T treatments. The drought treatment commenced on 26
    March 2012 (defined as Day 1). Pots were weighed in the morning (between 09:00
    and 10:00 h) to determine water loss every second or third day. Well-watered seedlings
    were maintained at field capacity throughout the experimental period by replacing
    the amount of water lost during the preceding measurement interval. Drought seedlings
    received no water after the commencement of the drought treatment. Four blank
    pots filled with soil, but without seedlings, in each of the four glasshouse compartments
    (i.e., two for well-watered and two for drought) were used to monitor soil water
    evaporation. Hence, we could determine seedling water use independent of soil
    water evaporation. Soil VWC (m3 m-3) was measured using TDR probes (30 cm length;
    CS616, Campbell Scientific, Logan, UT, USA) in two randomly selected pots (one
    each for well-watered and drought, respectively) for each species in each of the
    four C and T treatments. Measurements were logged every hour, and data were stored
    in a data logger (CR3000, Campbell Scientific). Using regular measurements of
    pot weight from seedlings with TDRs, we obtained a linear regression between changes
    in pot weight (i.e., pot weight during drought progression compared with pots
    that were well-watered) and soil VWC for each species. We used this relationship
    to estimate soil VWC for each pot using pot weight."

  replicates: 1
  methods: Oven-dried plant organ samples from Days 1 to 206 were ground to fine powder
    in a ball mill. NSC concentration (mg g-1) (as the sum of starch concentration
    and soluble sugar concentration) was assayed following procedures described in
    Mitchell et al. (2013). Organ samples (20 mg) were weighed and then extracted
    with 5 ml of 80% aqueous ethanol (v/v) in a polyethylene tube. The mixture was
    boiled in a water bath at 95 deg C for 30 min, and then centrifuged at 3000 rpm
    for 5 min. The supernatant was collected and the pellet re-extracted once with
    5 ml of 80% aqueous ethanol (v/v) and once with 5 ml of distilled water, then
    boiled and centrifuged as before. The supernatants were reserved and evaporated
    to the last 1-3 ml in a Rotational Vacuum Concentrator at 40 deg C. Total starch
    was determined on the pellets remaining after the ethanol and water extractions,
    and assayed enzymatically using a total starch assay kit (Megazyme International
    Ireland Ltd, Wicklow, Ireland). Soluble sugars were determined on the supernatants
    by the anthrone method (Ebell 1969).

  methods: Three seedlings within each species assigned to well-watered treatment
    (n = 3) in each of the four C and T treatments were randomly selected for destructive
    harvest to establish a predrought baseline at the onset of the experimental drought
    (Day 1). Harvests were subsequently conducted on both well-watered and drought
    plants on Days 58 and 120 (n = 3). At the end of the experiment, when all drought
    seedlings were considered 'dead' (Day 206), the remaining seedlings were harvested
    (n = 4). At each harvest, seedlings were separated into leaves, stem and roots.
    Roots were washed free of soil. All harvested fresh organs were immediately placed
    into an oven at 110 deg C for 1 h to kill any biological activity. The plant organs
    were then dried at 70 deg C for 72 h and dry mass was determined. Root to shoot
    ratio was calculated by AusTraits as the ratio of root dry mass to aboveground
    dry mass.

    area was calculated by AusTraits as total leaf area divided by leaf dry mass.
