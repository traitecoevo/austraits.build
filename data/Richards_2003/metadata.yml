  description: Rainforest trait data from Anna Richards
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: 'Three species pairs were studied: Gardenia actinocarpa (restricted)
    and G. ovularis (widespread); Archidendron kanisii (restricted) and A. whitei
    (widespread); Xanthostemon formosus (restricted) and X. chrysanthus (widespread).
    Five of the species grow in Daintree National Park, and Archidendron whitei occurs
    in the Crater Lakes World Heritage area on the Atherton Tablelands (Table 1).
    A. whitei was chosen over other Archidendron species growing in the Daintree area
    because it is the most closely related species in the genus with the most similar
    life form and population structure, it has already been mapped extensively, and
    it shares similar life history traits with A. kanisii. Three to four individuals
    of each species were measured in summer (December 1999) and in winter (June 2000).
    Site details are summarised in Table 1 and are further described in Shapcott et
    al. (in preparation).'

  methods: Whole dried leaves were used for stable isotope and leaf element analysis.
    Leaf material was ground in a vibratory ball mill (Retsch MM-2, Haan, Germany),
    5 mg of tissue was weighed into a tin capsule and %N, %C, and d13C were measured
    in a mass spectrometer (CF-IRMS, Tracer Mass, Europa Scientific, Crewe, UK).

  methods: Youngest fully expanded leaves were collected. Leaf discs were removed
    with a cork borer, fresh weight and surface area recorded. Discs were stored in
    liquid nitrogen for pigment analysis (~100 mg leaf fresh weight). Additional discs
    were dried at 50degC and specific leaf area (cm2 g-1) calculated.

  entity_type: species

  methods: Roots of Archidendron species were excavated to determine whether N2 fixing
    symbioses were present. Nodules found on Archidendron kanisii roots were stored
    on silica gel and confirmed to be active symbioses (J. Sprent, University of Dundee,
    Scotland, pers. comm.).

  trait_name: root_structure

  methods: Roots of Archidendron species (Mimosaceae) were excavated to assess for
    nodulation. Nodules found on an Archidendron kanisii seedling were stored on silica
    and sent for electron microscopy to Professor J. Sprent (University of Dundee,
    Scotland). For assessment of mycorrhizal associations, surface roots were traced
    from the base of plants to the fine rootlets and stored in 50% ethanol. Endomycorrhizal
    analysis was performed on all six species by Dr Evelina Facelli at the Department
    of Soil and Water, The University of Adelaide - Waite Campus. Roots from the two
    Xanthostemon species were examined for ectomycorrhizqe under a x10 objective light
    microscope lens.

  entity_type: individual
  value_type: raw

  methods: All measurements were performed in the field on attached, intact, youngest
    fully expanded leaves. Leaf net C02 assimilation rate was measured using a portable
    infrared gas analyser (Li,6400, LICOR Inc, Lincoln, Nebraska, USA). Irradiance
    sources were sun & sky or a quartz halogen lamp, flow rate was 500-1000 ~-tmol
    s-1 and no temperature control was used. C02 exchange was measured over 6cm2 of
    leaf. The air passing through the chamber and infrared gas analysers was drawn
    from the ambient forest understorey 4-5m away. Seven measurements were taken for
    each replicate sample after the rate had reached a steady state. Transpiration
    rate and stomatal conductance were simultaneously determined.
