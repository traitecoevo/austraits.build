  description: Rainforest trait data from Anna Richards
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: 'Three species pairs were studied: Gardenia actinocarpa (restricted)
    and G. ovularis (widespread); Archidendron kanisii (restricted) and A. whitei
    (widespread); Xanthostemon formosus (restricted) and X. chrysanthus (widespread).
    Five of the species grow in Daintree National Park, and Archidendron whitei occurs
    in the Crater Lakes World Heritage area on the Atherton Tablelands (Table 1).
    A. whitei was chosen over other Archidendron species growing in the Daintree area
    because it is the most closely related species in the genus with the most similar
    life form and population structure, it has already been mapped extensively, and
    it shares similar life history traits with A. kanisii. Three to four individuals
    of each species were measured in summer (December 1999) and in winter (June 2000).
    Site details are summarised in Table 1 and are further described in Shapcott et
    al. (in preparation).'

traits:
- var_in: Leaf N %

  trait_name: leaf_N_per_dry_mass
  value_type: site_mean
  replicates: 3-4
  methods: Whole dried leaves were used for stable isotope and leaf element analysis.
    Leaf material was ground in a vibratory ball mill (Retsch MM-2, Haan, Germany),
    5 mg of tissue was weighed into a tin capsule and %N, %C, and d13C were measured
    in a mass spectrometer (CF-IRMS, Tracer Mass, Europa Scientific, Crewe, UK).
- var_in: SLA (cm2g)
  unit_in: cm2/g
  trait_name: specific_leaf_area
  value_type: site_mean
  replicates: 3-4
  methods: Youngest fully expanded leaves were collected. Leaf discs were removed
    with a cork borer, fresh weight and surface area recorded. Discs were stored in
    liquid nitrogen for pigment analysis (~100 mg leaf fresh weight). Additional discs
    were dried at 50Â°C and specific leaf area (cm2 g-1) calculated.

questions:
  austraits: paper also has d13C, d15N on leaves, chlorophyll, gas exchange,
    micronutrients, root associations. Do we want to include these - they are all
    standard traits. Some, but not all the data is in the second Richards data file
    (Richards_2008). However in the second file, data aren't linked to a location.
