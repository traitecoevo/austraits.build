  description: angiosperm dispersal data from Si-Chong Chen PhD
  collection_type: Various
  sample_age_class: adult_assumed
  sampling_strategy: Our study concerned vertebrates ingesting seeds, and the replicates
    were animal x plant interactions. Published data for vertebrate species and the
    seed species in their diet were located using the Institute for Scientific Information
    (ISI)Web of Knowledge (accessed in 2013) with the search terms (f$eces OR f$ecal
    OR dung$ OR scat$ OR dropping$ OR defecat* OR ingest* OR endozoochor* OR gut content$
    OR stomach content$ OR gizzard content$ OR diet OR food selection OR food resource$
    OR foraging OR frugivor* OR seed predat*) AND (seed$ OR fruit$ OR dispers*). We
    also searched for relevant papers in the reference lists of some focal papers.
    The plants in each animal's diet were recorded to species level where possible,
    but the unknown or undetermined plant species that had information about seed
    dimension in the original papers were also included. (This dataset is the angiosperm
    data. The gymnosperm data is separate.)
  original_file: seed_fruit_data.xls
  notes: Fruit types were defined in a functional manner, as dispersal units, including
    true fruits (e.g. Beilschmiedia recurva), accessory fruits (such as the receptacle
    in Semecarpus australiensis or the receptacle in Podocarpus) and appendages (e.g.
    the sarcotesta in Cycads). Fruits were classified as fleshy if they possessed
    conspicuous fleshy pericarps or fleshy appendages when mature (e.g. aril, thalamus,
    receptacle, calyx, rachis or bract or succulent pedicel); otherwise, they were
    classified as non-fleshy.
