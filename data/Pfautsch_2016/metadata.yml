  description: We present two comprehensive data sets that describe xylem vessel diameters
    and related sapwood traits for species of Eucalyptus from arid and semi-arid woodlands
    and forests in Australia. The data sets are unique in the sense that they are
    phylogenetically constrained, allowing in-depth assessment of plasticity of hydraulic
    attributes within a single tree genus.
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: Between 2009 and 2014, sapwood of mature trees was sampled in
    south-western, south-eastern and eastern Australia. One additional species was
    sampled from tropical north-western Australia. The first data set describes samples
    collected from the basal stem section (130 cm above ground) of three individuals
    of 31 species of which eight species were replicated at sites that differed in
    climatic conditions. The second data set describes vessel characteristics of three
    trees from each of 10 species that were sampled at 8 m below the tree apex. The
    sampled trees of these 10 species are also part of the first data set.

  notes: The two data sets have been combined to create this one comprehensive data
    set.

    and site between 2009 and 2014. Only mature, dominant trees without visible injuries
    or deformations, or reaction wood, were selected. Sapwood cores were extracted
    using a motorised (TED-262R, Tanaka, Japan) TRECOR(R) (CSIRO, Australia) tree
    corer (Figure 3) or a hand operated increment corer (SUUNTO, Finland), while sapwood
    wedges were cut with a hand- or chainsaw (Figure 4). Following the extraction,
    samples were kept fresh (on ice in the field, at 4ºC in the lab) in sealed tubes
    or plastic bags. ^p Fresh weight and volume of cubes of sapwood (size of cubes
    varied between 1 and 10 cm3, according to thickness of sapwood) from the outermost
    1 cm of sapwood were measured, before drying at 105 °C for 48h. Sapwood density
    (density-SW, g cm-3) was calculated from dry weight and volume.

    (density-SW, g cm-3) was calculated from dry weight and volume. A second set of
    fresh wood cubes (transversal plane of <0.5 cm2) was used to prepare three transversal
    sections (25-45um thickness depending on species) using rotary (Leica RM2255,
    Leica Microsystems, Germany) and sliding microtomes (Leica SM2010R). Resulting
    wood specimens were stained using a common histological dye (safranin) to simplify
    subsequent image analysis. Stained sections were positioned on glass slides and
    secured with cover glass for microscopic analysis. ^p Depending on vessel size
    and abundance, between three and eight digital images were acquired at random
    locations at various magnifications (50-, 100-, 200-times) using a transmission
    light microscope (Leica DM2500M, Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany). Digital
    images were captured using a mounted  high-resolution camera (Leica DFC 500, Leica
    Microsystems). Images were manually post processed to recreate partially destroyed
    or obscured vessels. Data of xylem vessel properties were generated from the corrected
    images using the LAS software package (Version 3.8, Leica Microsystems) or the
    freeware ImageJ (National Institutes of Health, Maryland, USA). These data included
    number, area and equivalent circular diameter (D) of each image.

  methods: We calculated hydraulic properties of sapwood for each species and site.
    Mean hydraulically-weighted vessel diameter (Dh) for each species and site was
    calculated after Kolb and Sperry (1999), as follows, where D is the equivalent
    circular diameter of vessels. Average vessel frequency (FV) was calculated per
    image by dividing of the sum of vessels by the image area. Resulting densities
    were scaled to a unified area basis (FV cm-2) before averaging FV per species
    and site. Similarly, the void-to-wood ratio (deltaVW) was calculated by dividing
    the sum of vessel area by the image area before scaling to species and site level.
