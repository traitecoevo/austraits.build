  description: Anatomy of photosynthetic organs of 39 xeromorphic species from subhumid
    NSW.
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: The photosynthetic organs (leaves, phyllodes, cladodes, and phyllichnia)
    of 39 species from 19 families, consisting of four species of perennial herb,
    22 shrub species,and 13 tree species, were collected for anatomical and scanning
    electron microscope (SEM) examination (table 1).

    description: The Rock Nature Reserve (lat. 357169S, long. 1477049E), South Western Slopes, New South Wales, is a small (341 ha) island of remnant vegetation surrounded by an extensively modified agricultural landscape. A north-south ridge, the highest point of which is over 350 m above the surrounding plains, dominates the reserve. Approximately 215 vascular plant species, in an open woodland with an overstory dominated by species of Eucalyptus, Acacia, and Callitris, have been recorded at this site (Burrows 1999). Of these species, 18 (8%) are trees, 36 (17%) are shrubs, 85 (40%) are perennial herbs, and 74 (35%) are annuals or biennials (Burrows 1999). The majority of the perennial herbs die back by the start of summer to an underground tuber, bulb, or similar structure, and only a few species, such as Dianella revoluta and Lomandra filiformis, stay in leaf during summer. Thus, only ca. 25% of the recorded species remain in leaf, or equivalent, for the whole year.

    photosynthetic organs, not total leaf area.
