  description: Anatomy of photosynthetic organs of 39 xeromorphic species from subhumid
    NSW.
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: The photosynthetic organs (leaves, phyllodes, cladodes, and phyllichnia)
    of 39 species from 19 families, consisting of four species of perennial herb,
    22 shrub species,and 13 tree species, were collected for anatomical and scanning
    electron microscope (SEM) examination (table 1).

  notes: The few duplicate values within this dataset and with Roderick dataset seem
    to all be coincidental - they are independent measurements.

    description: The Rock Nature Reserve (lat. 357169S, long. 1477049E), South Western
      Slopes, New South Wales, is a small (341 ha) island of remnant vegetation surrounded
      by an extensively modified agricultural landscape. A north-south ridge, the
      highest point of which is over 350 m above the surrounding plains, dominates
      the reserve. Approximately 215 vascular plant species, in an open woodland with
      an overstory dominated by species of Eucalyptus, Acacia, and Callitris, have
      been recorded at this site (Burrows 1999). Of these species, 18 (8%) are trees,
      36 (17%) are shrubs, 85 (40%) are perennial herbs, and 74 (35%) are annuals
      or biennials (Burrows 1999). The majority of the perennial herbs die back by
      the start of summer to an underground tuber, bulb, or similar structure, and
      only a few species, such as Dianella revoluta and Lomandra filiformis, stay
      in leaf during summer. Thus, only ca. 25% of the recorded species remain in
      leaf, or equivalent, for the whole year.
