  description: Whole-plant and tissue water relations of eight woody species from
    a humid wet-dry tropical savanna in the Darwin region of northern Australia to
    understand how seasonal changes in water availability and plant deciduousness
    affect water relations traits.
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: The Study Site ^p  The study site was at Solar Village, about
    35 km south-east of Darwin, and is described by Fensham (1990). Mean annual rainfall
    at a rainfall recording station 5 km from the site is 1695 mm (Collard Road 12°348S,
    131°058E; Bureau of Meteorology) and falls almost entirely between October and
    March (Fig. 1). Mean monthly vapour pressure deficit (VPD) varies with season
    between a minimum of about 1 kPa in the wet season and a maximum of about 3 kPa
    throughout the dry season, whereas monthly pan evaporation is about 250 mm throughout
    the year (Fig. 1). Soils are sandy loams, derived from lateritic substrates. The
    vegetation is open forest (sensu Specht 1981), 20-25 m tall, with a canopy cover
    of about 50%. It is dominated by Eucalyptus miniata and E. tetrodonta, with other
    woody subdominants and an understorey of shrubs with some grasses. Leaf area index
    of the woody component of a similar vegetation type is about 1 and varies seasonally
    by about 10% (A. O'Grady, unpublished data). The forest has not been burnt since
    1977, which is unusual for savannas in the Darwin region (Braithwaite and Estbergs
    1985). The grass and herb stratum is minor and so contributes little to the seasonal
    variation in leaf area index of the community. All measurements and samplings
    were made within a 160 m x 50 m belt transect, which was aligned down a gentle
    slope (Williams et al. 1996b). Replicate trees of the eight target species were
    tagged in each of seven adjacent blocks along the belt transect. ^p  The Species
    ^p  The eight target species were the most common woody species at the site and
    included representatives of the main phenological types described by Williams
    et al. (1997). Individual sample trees were all 4-6 m tall. The species were the
    evergreen species Eucalyptus miniata and E. tetrodonta (Myrtaceae), the semi-deciduous
    species Erythrophleum chlorostachys (Caesalpiniaceae), Xanthostemon paradoxus
    (Myrtaceae) and Eucalyptus clavigera (Myrtaceae), and the fully deciduous species
    Planchonia careya (Lecythidaceae), Terminalia ferdinandiana (Combretaceae) and
    Cochlospermum fraseri (Bixaceae). Nomenclature follows Dunlop et al. (1990), and,
    except for the eucalypts, species hereafter will be referred to by the generic
    name only.

  methods: Leaf phenology of the species used in this study was monitored every 2
    weeks during the experiment at the study site. Data are reported in a separate
    paper (Williams et al. 1997). Phenological 213Savanna Water Relations and Phenological
    Responses classifications derived from that study can be summarised as follows,
    evergreen species that retained 75-100% of their canopy throughout the year (Eucalyptus
    miniata and E. tetrodonta); semi-deciduous species in which the canopy fell to
    below 50% of full canopy in each dry season, normally for at least 2-3 months
    (Erythrophleum chlorostachys, Eucalyptus clavigera and Xanthostemon paradoxus);
    and deciduous species in which all individuals lost all leaves during the dry
    season, and were leafless for at least 1-2 months (Cochlospermum fraseri, Planchonia
    careya and Terminalia ferdinandiana)

  methods: The tissue water characteristics of the target species, except Cochlospermum,
    were derived from pressure-volume curves that were constructed during November
    and December 1992 (early wet season) and during April and May 1993 (late wet season).
    Small branches were cut from trees in the late afternoon and immediately recut
    underwater. These branches were kept in a dark and cool environment, with the
    cut end in water, for 12-36 h before pressure-volume curves were constructed.
    Cochlospermum was not studied, because leaves were not able to be fully rehydrated
    after sampling. After rehydration, a plastic bag was placed over a leaf before
    excision and leaves were rejected if the initial c was less than -0.05 MPa. In
    most cases, the initial c was greater than -0.02 MPa. Single leaves were used
    for all species except Erythrophleum, for which groups of two or three leaflets
    were used. For the eucalypts, pressure-volume curves were constructed by the air-drying
    method (Hinckley et al. 1980), i.e. from repeated, paired measurements of leaf
    mass and c. Leaves were allowed to transpire on the bench, at first covered with
    a plastic bag to slow the rate of drying and later uncovered. This method was
    not appropriate for the other species because the cooling that inevitably accompanied
    the release of pressure after each measurement of c caused chilling injury to
    leaf tissue. For the species other than the eucalypts, pressure-volume curves
    were constructed by the sap expression method (Tyree and Hammel 1972), i.e. by
    keeping the sample leaf in the pressure chamber under pressure, increasing the
    pressure by increments and calculating leaf mass for each pressure by collecting
    and weighing the expressed sap. The two methods were compared for three paired
    samples of E. clavigera and there was no significant difference between parameters
    derived by the two methods. However, Hardegree (1989) notes that the existence
    and direction of difference between these two methods varies between species and
    may be influenced by the relative volumes of apoplast and symplast and characteristics
    of the xylem that affect cavitation and air entry. The following parameters were
    derived, osmotic potential at full turgor (p100), osmotic potential at incipient
    plasmolysis (p0), relative water content at incipient plasmolysis (u0), bulk modulus
    of elasticity at full turgor (e) and the ratio of turgid weight to dry weight
    (TW:DW).

  methods: Diurnal variations in xylem pressure potential (c) and leaf conductance
    to water vapour (g) of the eight target species were measured on five occasions,
    October 1992, and March, May, July and October 1993. At each time of year, measurements
    were made on 6-10 sunny days over a 2-3 week period. On each day, measurements
    were made on one tree of each species from one block within the study site. Thus
    any effects of day and replicate or block were intentionally confounded. Leaf
    conductance (g) was measured first when sunlight reached the leaves and their
    surfaces were dry (usually 0800 hours) and about every 2 h after that. Leaf conductance
    was measured on the underside of sunlit, fully expanded leaves, using a vapour
    diffusion porometer (Model AP4, Delta T Devices, Hoddestown, UK). Ten leaves were
    measured on each tree at each time of day. The daily maximum g (gmax) was defined
    as the maximum mean g per tree for each day. The following environmental parameters
    were measured throughout the days that diurnal cycles were measured, photosynthetically
    active quantum flux density (at half-hourly intervals using a ceptometer (Delta
    T Devices, Hoddestown, UK)) and air temperature and relative humidity at 0.8 m
    above the ground (using Vaisalla sensors logged every 15 min). Leaf-to-air vapour
    pressure difference (LAVPD) was calculated using leaf temperature, air temperature
    and relative humidity.

  methods: Pre-dawn leaf water potential (ypd) of the major woody species was measured
    about every 2 months from October 1992 to December 1994. On each occasion, 5-7
    replicate trees of each of the following species were sampled, the evergreen trees
    Eucalyptus miniata and E. tetrodonta; the semi-deciduous trees and shrubs Xanthostemon
    paradoxus, Erythrophleum chlorostachys and Eucalyptus clavigera; and the deciduous
    shrubs Terminalia ferdinandiana, Planchonia careya and Cochlospermum fraseri.
    Two leaves per individual were sampled before dawn and stored in sealed plastic
    bags, which were kept in a dark container. Measurements of ypd were made using
    a pressure chamber within 1 h of excision from the plant. Terminalia and Cochlospermum
    were leafless during some dry-season months.
