  description: We examined the interactive effects of [CO2] (290, 400 and 650 mLL-1)
    and temperature (ambient, ambient +4 deg C) on leaf structural and chemical traits
    that regulate photosynthesis in Eucalyptus sideroxylon

  sampling_strategy: 'Growth conditions Detailed experimental set-up is described
    by Ghannoum et al. (2010a). Briefly, 9 kg of air-dried loamy-sand field soil was
    added to 10-L PVC pots, which were transferred to six adjacent, naturally-lit
    and temperature controlled glasshouse compartments. Three compartments were programmed
    to simulate the local ambient temperature (Richmond, NSW) and the remaining three
    compartments were maintained at ambient +4_C. Average temperatures for the ambient
    and elevated temperature treatments were 26/18 and 30/22 deg C (day/night) respectively.
    Within each temperature treatment, compartments were maintained at pre-industrial
    (280 mLL-1 target), current (400 mLL-1 target) or elevated (640 mLL-1 target)
    [CO2]. Atmospheric [CO2] was controlled and monitored as described by Ghannoum
    et al. (2010a). Mean daytime [CO2] during the experiment for the pre-industrial,
    current and elevated treatments was 290, 400 and 650 mLL-1 respectively. RH, monitored
    by Tinytag data loggers (TinyView, Gemini Data Loggers LTD, Chichester, UK), averaged
    57% during the study and did not differ among [CO2] and temperature treatments.
    As a result, vapour pressure deficit (VPD) was higher in the elevated compared
    with the ambient temperature treatment (1.8 vs 1.4 kPa, on average). Maximum mid-day
    photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), measured at a nearby (1 km away) weather
    station, was 2360 mmolm-2 s-1. Across the study, peak midday PAR averaged 1250
    mmolm-2 s-1. The glasshouse structure attenuated direct sunlight by ~10-15%. ^p
    Plant growth Seeds of red ironbark (Eucalyptus sideroxylon A.Cunn. ex. Woolls)
    were obtained from Ensis (Australian Tree Seed Centre, ACT) and germinated at
    ambient [CO2] in plastic greenhouses. Four weeks after germination, seedlings
    were transplanted by planting one seedling into the middle of each prepared pot.
    Pots were irrigated every 2-3 days as needed. Pots were irrigated on three occasions
    (30, 120 and 135 days after planting (DAP)) with a commercial fertiliser (General
    Purpose, Thrive Professional, Yates, Sydney, NSW) at a concentration of 0.2 g
    NL-1 (N: P : K : S : Fe :Mn: B; 25: 4.1 : 17.3 : 1.6 : 0.06 : 0.003 : 0.022%).
    Pots were routinely moved within the glasshouse compartments during the experimental
    period. Five pots from each treatment were randomly selected for this study.'

  methods: Duplicate 1.0x0.5 cm sections were collected, after 7 months of growth,
    on opposite sides of the midvein in the mid region of the lamina; one leaf was
    used per pot. The leaf tissue was immediately fixed in double aldehyde fixative
    containing 0.01 g of Triton-X, washed in three changes of 0.1M phosphate buffer
    (pH 6.9) and then dehydrated in an ethanol series before being embedded in LR
    White Resin (ProSci Tech, Townsville, Qld). Transverse sections 2 mm thick were
    stained with 0.1% toluidine blue. Sections were photographed using a JenOptik
    C14 digital camera attached to an Olympus compound light microscope (Olympus BX60,
    Center Valley, PA). Five images were recorded at various points along the leaf
    section. Image- Pro Plus (ver. 5.1; Media Cybernetics Inc., Bethesda, MD) was
    used to analyse leaf and epidermal thickness, palisade cell size, number of palisade
    layers and the contributions of cell layers and intercellular air space to leaf
    thickness and density. Percent palisade and percent intercellular airspace were
    calculated as the fraction of leaf structure between the epidermal layers occupied
    by palisade cells and intercellular air space respectively.

    sulfate (Sigma-Aldrich). The tube was vortexed and incubated in a 90 deg C water
    bath for 5 min, then centrifuged at 12 000g for 5 min. This step was repeated.
    The pellet was then washed twice with 0.2M KOH, twice with distilled water and
    twice with ethanol, mixing well and centrifuging at 12 000g for 5 min at each
    step. The pellet was oven-dried at 70 deg C and the dry mass was assumed to represent

    and water-use efficiency (WUE) were measured, after 7 months of growth, on one

    using a portable open gas-exchange system (Li-6400XT, Li-Cor, Lincoln, NE). Asat
    and Amax measurements were made on the same leaf at saturating light (1800 mmol
