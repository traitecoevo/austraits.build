  description: We examined the interactive effects of [CO2] (290, 400 and 650 mLL-1)
    and temperature (ambient, ambient +4 deg C) on leaf structural and chemical traits
    that regulate photosynthesis in Eucalyptus sideroxylon
  collection_type: glasshouse
  sample_age_class: sapling
  sampling_strategy: 'Growth conditions Detailed experimental set-up is described
    by Ghannoum et al. (2010a). Briefly, 9 kg of air-dried loamy-sand field soil was
    added to 10-L PVC pots, which were transferred to six adjacent, naturally-lit
    and temperature controlled glasshouse compartments. Three compartments were programmed
    to simulate the local ambient temperature (Richmond, NSW) and the remaining three
    compartments were maintained at ambient +4_C. Average temperatures for the ambient
    and elevated temperature treatments were 26/18 and 30/22 deg C (day/night) respectively.
    Within each temperature treatment, compartments were maintained at pre-industrial
    (280 mLL-1 target), current (400 mLL-1 target) or elevated (640 mLL-1 target)
    [CO2]. Atmospheric [CO2] was controlled and monitored as described by Ghannoum
    et al. (2010a). Mean daytime [CO2] during the experiment for the pre-industrial,
    current and elevated treatments was 290, 400 and 650 mLL-1 respectively. RH, monitored
    by Tinytag data loggers (TinyView, Gemini Data Loggers LTD, Chichester, UK), averaged
    57% during the study and did not differ among [CO2] and temperature treatments.
    As a result, vapour pressure deficit (VPD) was higher in the elevated compared
    with the ambient temperature treatment (1.8 vs 1.4 kPa, on average). Maximum mid-day
    photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), measured at a nearby (1 km away) weather
    station, was 2360 mmolm-2 s-1. Across the study, peak midday PAR averaged 1250
    mmolm-2 s-1. The glasshouse structure attenuated direct sunlight by ~10-15%. ^p
    Plant growth Seeds of red ironbark (Eucalyptus sideroxylon A.Cunn. ex. Woolls)
    were obtained from Ensis (Australian Tree Seed Centre, ACT) and germinated at
    ambient [CO2] in plastic greenhouses. Four weeks after germination, seedlings
    were transplanted by planting one seedling into the middle of each prepared pot.
    Pots were irrigated every 2-3 days as needed. Pots were irrigated on three occasions
    (30, 120 and 135 days after planting (DAP)) with a commercial fertiliser (General
    Purpose, Thrive Professional, Yates, Sydney, NSW) at a concentration of 0.2 g
    NL-1 (N: P : K : S : Fe :Mn: B; 25: 4.1 : 17.3 : 1.6 : 0.06 : 0.003 : 0.022%).
    Pots were routinely moved within the glasshouse compartments during the experimental
    period. Five pots from each treatment were randomly selected for this study.'

  methods: Duplicate 1.0x0.5 cm sections were collected, after 7 months of growth,
    on opposite sides of the midvein in the mid region of the lamina; one leaf was
    used per pot. The leaf tissue was immediately fixed in double aldehyde fixative
    containing 0.01 g of Triton-X, washed in three changes of 0.1M phosphate buffer
    (pH 6.9) and then dehydrated in an ethanol series before being embedded in LR
    White Resin (ProSci Tech, Townsville, Qld). Transverse sections 2 mm thick were
    stained with 0.1% toluidine blue. Sections were photographed using a JenOptik
    C14 digital camera attached to an Olympus compound light microscope (Olympus BX60,
    Center Valley, PA). Five images were recorded at various points along the leaf
    section. Image- Pro Plus (ver. 5.1; Media Cybernetics Inc., Bethesda, MD) was
    used to analyse leaf and epidermal thickness, palisade cell size, number of palisade
    layers and the contributions of cell layers and intercellular air space to leaf
    thickness and density. Percent palisade and percent intercellular airspace were
    calculated as the fraction of leaf structure between the epidermal layers occupied
    by palisade cells and intercellular air space respectively.

  methods: Three leaves per plant were harvested on a sunny day during the gas-exchange campaign, between 1100 and 1300 hours, for carbohydrate and cell wall content analysis. Leaf samples were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored in a -85deg C freezer. Before analysis, subsamples were freeze-dried for 24 h, then ground to a fine dust. Soluble sugars were assayed using a modified anthrone method as described in Ebell (1969) and total starch was enzymatically assayed on the residual pellet using a Megazyme total starch kit (Megazyme International Ireland Ltd, Wicklow, Ireland); total non-structural carbohydrate (TNC) was calculated as the sum of soluble sugar and starch.

Soluble sugars were assayed using a modified anthrone method as described in Ebell (1969) and total starch was enzymatically assayed on the residual pellet using a Megazyme total starch kit (Megazyme International Ireland Ltd, Wicklow, Ireland); total non-structural carbohydrate (TNC) was calculated as the sum of soluble sugar and starch.

  methods: Four leaf disks from recently fully expanded leaves were collected from each plant, in conjunction with samples collected for carbohydrate analyses, for chlorophyll and soluble protein content. Leaf disks were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored in a -85deg C freezer until extraction. Disks were extracted in 1.49mL of buffer (0.077 g 5mM DTT, 1 g 10% glycerol, 100 mL 1mM MgCl2, 40mL 0.5M EDTA, 20 mL 0.5M EGTA, 120 mL aminocaproic acid, 80 mL benzamidine, made up to 10mL with 50mM HEPES (pH 8.0)), 0.1 g 1% PVP and 10 mL 10mM PMSF in a pre-cooled mortar. Total chlorophyll content was determined on subsamples of the extract using an acetone-extract colourimetric method, as described by Porra et al. (1989). The remaining extract was centrifuged for 2 min and soluble protein content was determined on aliquots of the supernatant using a Coomassie Plus kit (VWR International, Brisbane, Qld).

  methods: Three leaves per plant were harvested on a sunny day during the gas-exchange campaign, between 1100 and 1300 hours, for carbohydrate and cell wall content analysis. Leaf samples were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored in a -85deg C freezer. Before analysis, subsamples were freeze-dried for 24 h, then ground to a fine dust. Cell wall content was determined as described by Harrison et al. (2009). About 10 mg of ground, freeze-dried leaf material was vortexed in 1.5mL of buffer (50mM tricine, pH 8.1) containing 1% PVP40 (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO), then centrifuged at 12 000g for 5 min. The supernatant was removed and the pellet re-suspended in 1.5mL of buffer without PVP containing 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (Sigma-Aldrich). The tube was vortexed and incubated in a 90 deg C water bath for 5 min, then centrifuged at 12 000g for 5 min. This step was repeated. The pellet was then washed twice with 0.2M KOH, twice with distilled water and twice with ethanol, mixing well and centrifuging at 12 000g for 5 min at each step. The pellet was oven-dried at 70 deg C and the dry mass was assumed to represent the leaf structural biomass.

  trait_name: specific_leaf_area
  value_type: individual_mean
  replicates: '8-10'
  methods: Leaf mass per area (LMA) was measured in conjunction with gas-exchange
    measurements. A minimum of 40 leaf disks from 8-10 recently fully expanded leaves
    per plant were collected using a 0.2 cm2 leaf corer. The disks were ovendried
    at 70 deg C for 48 h and weighed for dry mass. LMA was calculated as leaf dry
    mass/area (gm-2).

  trait_name: leaf_density
  value_type: individual_mean
  replicates: 2
  methods: Duplicate 1.0x0.5 cm sections were collected, after 7 months of growth,
    on opposite sides of the midvein in the mid region of the lamina; one leaf was
    used per pot. The leaf tissue was immediately fixed in double aldehyde fixative
    containing 0.01 g of Triton-X, washed in three changes of 0.1M phosphate buffer
    (pH 6.9) and then dehydrated in an ethanol series before being embedded in LR
    White Resin (ProSci Tech, Townsville, Qld). Transverse sections 2 mm thick were
    stained with 0.1% toluidine blue. Sections were photographed using a JenOptik
    C14 digital camera attached to an Olympus compound light microscope (Olympus BX60,
    Center Valley, PA). Five images were recorded at various points along the leaf
    section. Image- Pro Plus (ver. 5.1; Media Cybernetics Inc., Bethesda, MD) was
    used to analyse leaf and epidermal thickness, palisade cell size, number of palisade
    layers and the contributions of cell layers and intercellular air space to leaf
    thickness and density. Percent palisade and percent intercellular airspace were
    calculated as the fraction of leaf structure between the epidermal layers occupied
    by palisade cells and intercellular air space respectively.

  methods: Net photosynthesis at saturating light (Asat) and near-saturating CO2 (Amax), stomatal conductance (gs), the ratio of intercellular to ambient [CO2] (Ci/Ca) and water-use efficiency (WUE) were measured, after 7 months of growth, on one attached, recently fully expanded leaf per plant in the top-third of the plant, using a portable open gas-exchange system (Li-6400XT, Li-Cor, Lincoln, NE). Asat and Amax measurements were made on the same leaf at saturating light (1800 mmolm–2 s –1) with a target VPD of 1.4 kPa. Asat was measured at target growth [CO2] (280, 400 or 640 mLL–1) and midday growth temperature (26 or 30 deg C). Amax was measured at 1200 mLL–1 [CO2] and 26 deg C. Each leaf was allowed to stabilise before measurements were taken.
