  description: Study investigating density changes after fire for different fire response
    functional groups, in relation to post-fire rainfall and fire interval length.
  basis_of_record: field field_experiment
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: Time since last fire (TSF) was determined for natural shrubland
    vegetation across the study region from Jurien Bay in the south to Mt Adams Road
    in the north (Fig. 1) using fire history maps derived from satellite imagery.
    Selected sites (n = 33) ranged in TSF from 3 to 24 years, with a bias towards
    sites < 10 years since last fire in order to focus on impacts of shortened fire
    intervals. These sites of varied time since fire were burned experimentally to
    create fire interval treatments of varying length (see below). ^p Data Collection
    ^p A 40 × 40 m plot was established at each site and eight replicate 4 × 4 m subplots
    located within each based on a restricted random distribution such that subplot
    boundaries were no closer than 2 m. The identity and density of all woody species
    were recorded in each subplot. From 4 to 13 plots were sampled in autumn (March–April)
    of each year from 2006 to 2009, and then burned later in the same autumn (April–May)
    by state government fire management staff. Applying fire treatments over multiple
    years ensured that a range of pre- and post-fire rainfall conditions were sampled
    (see below, Table 1). Where fires did not propagate due to unsuitable weather
    or lack of fuel continuity, subplots were burned (including a 2 m buffer) using
    a truck-mounted flamethrower (see Fontaine et al. 2012 for details of fire behaviour
    and fuel measurements). Plots burned in 2006–08 were remeasured for density of
    all woody species 3 years after fire, and plots burned in 2009 were remeasured
    2 years after fire. Rainfall in the winter and summer preceding, and following,
    experimental fires ranged from average (within 5% of mean rainfall) to very dry
    (30–45% below average) (Table 1). Experimental fires were lit under weather conditions
    ranging from Moderate to Very High fire danger according to the McArthur Forest
    Fire Danger Index, but with no significant relationship between measures of fire
    intensity/severity and either weather conditions or fuel age (see Fontaine et
    al. 2012 and references therein for details).

locations:
  Geraldton Sandplain:
    latitude (deg): -29.9
    longitude (deg): 115.1
    description: The study was conducted in biodiverse Mediterranean-type shrublands
      (kwongan) of the Geraldton Sandplain region of SWA, 250–350 km north of Perth
      (Fig. 1). Vegetation is characterized by a broad range of perennial woody species
      as well as tussock and rhizomatous monocot taxa (Cyperaceae, Restionaceae, some
      Poaceae) growing in sandy soils of varying depth and age (Enright et al. 2012).
    precipitation, MAP (mm): 494
    temperature, mean summer max (C): 36.2
    temperature, mean winter max (C): 19.6
    precipitation, description: Warm–dry Mediterranean, with mean annual rainfall
      of 494 mm, 80% of which falls in the winter period from May to September (Eneabba
      climate station No. 008225, Australian Bureau of Meteorology)
    fire interval (years): Mean fire intervals estimated to range over 17–28 years
      across several shrubland types during the last 37 years (Enright et al. 2012).
    soil type: Sand over limestone and heavily leached acidic sands

  methods: A total of 153 woody species in 16 plant families was recorded in 264,
    4 × 4 m subplots across the 33 experimental fire sites (Table 2, Table S2 and
    archived data set, Enright et al. 2014). Species were assigned as resprouting
    or killed in response to fire, and with a serotinous or soil-stored (SSB) seed
    bank. All non-serotinous, woody species showed fire-cued germination apart from
    a few species characterized by post-fire flowering and dispersal of non-dormant
    seeds upon ripening (e.g. Xanthorrhoea spp.), but none of these were present in
    our samples. Data on species traits were obtained from our past work on this system
    (Enright et al. 2007), other published information (Sweedman & Merritt 2006) or
    personal observations during this study (see Table S2 for complete species list
    and trait set).
