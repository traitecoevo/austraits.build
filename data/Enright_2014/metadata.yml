  description: Study investigating density changes after fire for different fire response
    functional groups, in relation to post-fire rainfall and fire interval length.
  basis_of_record: literature field field_experiment
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: The study was conducted in biodiverse Mediterranean-type shrublands
    (kwongan) of the Geraldton Sandplain region of SWA, 250-350 km north of Perth
    (Fig. 1). The region is warm-dry Mediterranean, with mean annual rainfall of 494
    mm, 80% of which falls in the winter period from May to September (Eneabba climate
    station No. 008225, Australian Bureau of Meteorology). Mean daily maximum temperature
    ranges from 19.6 °C in July to 36.2 °C in February. The shrublands are fire prone,
    with mean fire intervals estimated to range over 17-28 years across several shrubland
    types during the last 37 years (Enright et al. 2012). Vegetation is characterized
    by a broad range of perennial woody species as well as tussock and rhizomatous
    monocot taxa (Cyperaceae, Restionaceae, some Poaceae) growing in sandy soils of
    varying depth and age (Enright et al. 2012). Two distinct soil types, sand over
    limestone and heavily leached acidic sands, were included in the study. Time since
    last fire (TSF) was determined for natural shrubland vegetation across the study
    region from Jurien Bay in the south to Mt Adams Road in the north (Fig. 1) using
    fire history maps derived from satellite imagery. Selected sites (n = 33) ranged
    in TSF from 3 to 24 years, with a bias towards sites < 10 years since last fire
    in order to focus on impacts of shortened fire intervals. These sites of varied
    time since fire were burned experimentally to create fire interval treatments
    of varying length (see below). ^p Data Collection ^p A 40 x 40 m plot was established
    at each site and eight replicate 4 x 4 m subplots located within each based on
    a restricted random distribution such that subplot boundaries were no closer than
    2 m. The identity and density of all woody species were recorded in each subplot.
    From 4 to 13 plots were sampled in autumn (March-April) of each year from 2006
    to 2009, and then burned later in the same autumn (April-May) by state government
    fire management staff. Applying fire treatments over multiple years ensured that
    a range of pre- and post-fire rainfall conditions were sampled (see below, Table
    1). Where fires did not propagate due to unsuitable weather or lack of fuel continuity,
    subplots were burned (including a 2 m buffer) using a truck-mounted flamethrower
    (see Fontaine et al. 2012 for details of fire behaviour and fuel measurements).
    Plots burned in 2006-08 were remeasured for density of all woody species 3 years
    after fire, and plots burned in 2009 were remeasured 2 years after fire. Rainfall
    in the winter and summer preceding, and following, experimental fires ranged from
    average (within 5% of mean rainfall) to very dry (30-45% below average) (Table
    1). Experimental fires were lit under weather conditions ranging from Moderate
    to Very High fire danger according to the McArthur Forest Fire Danger Index, but
    with no significant relationship between measures of fire intensity/severity and
    either weather conditions or fuel age (see Fontaine et al. 2012 and references
    therein for details).

  methods: A total of 153 woody species in 16 plant families was recorded in 264,
    4 x 4 m subplots across the 33 experimental fire sites (Table 2, Table S2 and
    archived data set, Enright et al. 2014). Species were assigned as resprouting
    or killed in response to fire, and with a serotinous or soil-stored (SSB) seed
    bank. Data on species traits were obtained from our past work on this system (Enright
    et al. 2007), other published information (Sweedman & Merritt 2006) or personal
    observations during this study (see Table S2 for complete species list and trait
    set).

    or killed in response to fire, and with a serotinous or soil-stored (SSB) seed
    bank. This pertains to observations of species following treatment with fire.
    Plants either resprouted (extant, adult plants) or regenerated from seed (new
    recruits, seedlings). All non-serotinous, woody species showed fire-cued germination
    apart from a few species characterized by post-fire flowering and dispersal of
    non-dormant seeds upon ripening (e.g. Xanthorrhoea spp.), but none of these were
    present in our samples. Data on species traits were obtained from our past work
    on this system (Enright et al. 2007), other published information (Sweedman &
