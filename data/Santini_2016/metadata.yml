  description: This study examined variation in branch xylem anatomy and foliar carbon
    stable isotopes (d13C) as a measure of water-use efficiency (WUE) in seven co-occurring
    species, Acacia aneura, Acacia bivenosa, Corymbia opaca, Eucalyptus camaldulensis,
    Erythrina vespertilio, Hakea sp., and Psydrax latifolia, in an arid zone open
    Corymbia savanna on the Ti Tree Basin, Northern Territory, Australia.
  basis_of_record: field

  sampling_strategy: The study site was located in the Ti Tree Basin (22.7048.5600S,
    133.24057.6700E), approximately 180 km north of Alice Springs, Northern Territory,
    Australia. The site is arid with a mean annual rainfall of 347 mm year-1 (Australian
    Bureau of Meteorology 2014, BoM station 15507), most of which falls in monsoonal
    summer storms. Mean minimum and maximum annual temperatures are 15 and 31 degrees
    celcius, respectively. The site reaches maximum air temperatures of 40 degrees
    celcius in the summer months (December-February).The Ti Tree Basin extends over
    5500 km2 and contains the ephemeral Hanson and Woodforde rivers, which only flow
    after intense storms (Harrington et al. 2002). During July-September 2014, we
    collected upper canopy terminal branches of seven co-occurring woody species from
    the Ti Tree Basin Acacia aneura, Acacia bivenosa, Corymbia opaca, Eucalyptus camaldulensis,
    Erythrina vespertilio, Hakea sp., and Psydrax latifolia. Branches of different
    species varied in diameter (2-7 mm), but we standardised our collection by sampling
    the terminal 25 cm of each branch.

  methods: Branches were collected and stored in sealed vials containing 50% ethanol.
    Cross sections of each branch were fixed in formalin-acetic acid-alcohol (FAA)
    for 7 days and then placed in 70% ethanol for 2 days; we repeated this washing
    process twice. Micro-sections of all species with the exception of E. vespertilio
    were prepared with a sledge Leica SM2010R microtome. Micro-sections of E. vespertilio
    were pre-treated with ethanol (8 h), xylene (4 h) and finally embedded in paraffin
    with a Shandon Histocentre 3 histology-embedding centre (Thermo Fisher Scientific,
    Australia) before cutting with a Microm HM325 rotatory microtome (Thermo Fisher
    Scientific, Australia). Micro-sections of all species were double stained with
    safranin-alcian blue. We photographed the micro-sections with a Leica DM750 microscope
    and used the software Image J 1.48v (National Institutes of Health, USA) to measure
    xylem traits. We determined the minor (a) and major (b) axis diameters of xylem
    vessels to calculate vessel area (VA). We also determined vessel density (VD)
    (Eq. 2) to calculate conductive area (CA) of each species (Lewis 1992) (see manuscripts
    for equations).

  methods: Root material collected for assessment of wood density was stored in paper
    bags and kept cool for laboratory analysis. Wood density of roots was measured
    in 4-cm lengths of sapwood. Sample numbers of individual roots (i.e. one root
    sample per plant) for assessment of wood density were as follows, Erythrina vespertilio
    (n=5), Acacia aneura (n=5), Hakea sp. (n=5), Psydrax latifolia (n=5), Corymbia
    opaca (n=3) and Eucalyptus camaldulensis (n=5). Root sapwood segments were weighed
    after drying to a constant mass. Wood density was calculated as the ratio of dry
    weight (5 days at 60°C) to volume of water displaced by the fully hydrated sapwood
    segments (i.e., after they were submerged in water for two days; see Santini et
    al. 2016).

  methods: Material to measure density of intact branches and wood density was stored
    in paper bags and was maintained cool in an insulated container until laboratory
    analysis. Density of intact branches was measured from ~5 cm length branch segments.
    Branches were placed in water for 2 days to obtain full branch hydration. We measured
    the mass of the displaced hydrated branch. The same branches were oven dried for
    5 days at 60 °C to attain constant weight. Density of intact branches was calculated
    by dividing dry mass by hydrated branch volume. Wood density was measured following
    the same methods as for measuring density of intact branches but after carefully
    debarking our intact branches with a razor blade.

  methods: Samples stored in paper bags were completely dried in an oven at 60 °C
    for 5 days. Dry leaf samples were ground with a Retsch MM300 grinding mill (Verder
    Group, Netherlands). The ground material was placed in 3.5 mm x 5 mm tin capsules
    for analysis of d13C. Analyses were performed with a Picarro G2121-i Analyser
    (Picarro, Santa Clara, CA, USA) for isotopic CO2. Values of d13C were quantified
    as in Eq. (10), where R corresponds to the isotopic value 13CO2/12CO2 of the sample
    (R a) or the standard (R b). We used atropine and acetanilide as laboratory standard
    references. Results were normalised with the international standards sucrose (IAEA-CH-6,
    d13CVPDB = -10.45), cellulose (IAEA-CH-3, d13CVPDB = -24.72) and graphite (USGS24,

    safranin-alcian blue. We photographed the micro-sections with a Leica DM750 microscope
    and used the software Image J 1.48v (National Institutes of Health, USA) to measure
    xylem traits. We determined the minor (a) and major (b) axis diameters of xylem
    vessels to calculate vessel area (VA) following Eq. (1). We also determined vessel
    density (VD) (Eq. 2) to calculate conductive area (CA) of each species as in Eq.
    (3) (Lewis 1992). We measured fibre wall thickness by measuring the width of 30-50
    adjoining fibre walls and dividing the total distance by two (Santini et al. 2012).
    We also assessed vessel wall thickness by measuring double-vessel walls of 20-30
    vessels per species and dividing the total distance by two.

    safranin-alcian blue. We photographed the micro-sections with a Leica DM750 microscope
    and used the software Image J 1.48v (National Institutes of Health, USA) to measure
    xylem traits. We calculated the potential hydraulic conductivity (K s) as in Eq.
    (4), where F is the vessel fraction and S is the ratio of vessel size to vessel
    number, calculated as in Eq. (5) and (6) (Zanne et al. 2010). Finally, we determined
    a drought vulnerability index (VI) by dividing vessel diameter (D h) by vessel
    density (Carlquist 1977) Eq. (8) and (9). The vulnerability index is a measure
    of the redundancy of the number of vessels present per unit sapwood area. A low
    value is taken to indicate a large resistance to drought (Carlquist 1977).
