  description: seed measurements for Alyxia species from Forster (1992) taxonomic
    revision
  basis_of_record: preserved_specimen
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: This revision is based on herbarium collections at AD, BO, BRI,
    BSIP, CANB, CBG, DNA, MEL, PERTH, QRS and SING, and type material from BM, K and
    PR (herbarium abbreviations as per Holmgren et al. 1990). The selected specimens
    demonstrate geographical distribution and are those most widely duplicated in
    herbaria. All Australian species and subspecies, except A. buxifolia, were examined
    in the field during 1981 to 1992, and A. maluensis Markgraf was examined in the
    Solomon Islands in 1991.
