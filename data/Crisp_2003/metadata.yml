  description: The phylogeny of the Australian legume genus Daviesia was estimated
    using sequences of the internal transcribed spacers of nuclear ribosomal DNA,
    with key traits mapped onto the phylogeny to understand their evolutionary history.
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: Specimens and DNA Extraction ^p To represent the phylogenetic
    diversity in Daviesia, 46 exemplars (table 1) were sampled from 16 of 18 recognized
    morphological groups (M. D. Crisp, unpublished manuscript). The eight outgroups
    (table 1) include exemplars of Erichsenia, Gompholobium, Sphaerolobium, and Viminaria.
    These are the other four genera in the Daviesia group, which is characterized
    by embryo sacs with giant antipodal cells (Crisp and Weston 1995; Crisp et al.
    2000). On the basis of the results of previous phylogenetic analyses (Crisp et
    al. 2000; Crisp and Cook 2003), the trees were rooted using Gompholobium. Total
    genomic DNA was extracted from fresh NaCl/CTAB-stored specimens (Rogstad 1992)
    or dry specimens using CTAB/chloroform extraction. Vouchers for all accessions
    are lodged in CANB or PERTH and are cited by collector's name and number in table
    1. ^p Evolution of Root Traits ^p Root anatomy (cord or unistelar) was scored
    from field observation for all 54 taxa. The putative origins of root type were
    assessed by MP optimization using ACCTRAN and DELTRAN. Topology-dependent permutational
    probability tests (Faith 1991) were run and compared different constraint trees
    of cord-rooted and unistelar taxa. Tree-based ML modeling (Pagel 1994, 1999; Cunningham
    1999; Mooers and Schluter 1999) of the evolution of root traits was not used in
    this study because part of the tree was poorly resolved, with very short basal
    internodes and a mixture of root types. This would imply a very high rate of evolutionary
    change along the very short internodes, which seems unrealistic for a trait with
    discrete states such as root type. Moreover, different resolutions among the many
    possible for the unresolved nodes would imply different rates of change. By contrast,
    in the well-resolved parts of the tree, the root traits appear to have rarely
    changed. No single likelihood model would accurately model change in a tree showing
    such internal inconsistency.

  methods: Growth habit was classified into plants with stems (or rhizomes) arising
    from a buried root crown and plants with stems arising at or above ground level.
    Plants of the first type usually have a well-developed tap root and multiple fine
    stems and continue to produce new stems from the root crown (Dodd et al. 1984,
    fig. 8.7B1). Plants of the second type usually have one or few stems and tend
    to grow by the branching of aerial stems. In shrubs in fire-prone ecosystems such
    as the Kwongan, burial of the root crown or other perennating structures such
    as rhizomes is a growth form associated with survival and resprouting following
    fire, especially if these structures are 5 cm or more below the soil (Pate 1994;
    Whelan 1995). Shrubs with their shoot buds held above ground are more likely to
    be killed by fire and to depend on seeds to regenerate following fire.

  methods: Soil types recorded on herbarium sheets of each species were classified
    into laterite-derived types (the dominant type in the Kwongan) versus other types
    (in general, of higher nutrient status; Bettenay 1984). For all taxa included
    in the phylogenetic analysis, these data were checked in the field. Because both
    lateritic soils and cord-rooted species are restricted mainly to the southwest
    of Western Australia, the test was repeated including only species from that area
    (75 species).

  methods: In one highly anomalous root modification found in this ecosystem, secondary
    thickening occurs by the successive production of adventitious vascular cambia
    outside the current outermost layer of phloem (Pate et al. 1984, 1989; Pate and
    Dixon 1996). In cross section, these cambia form concentric rings, while longitudinally
    they anastomose, giving rise to a complex network of interlinking vascular strands.
    In external morphology, the roots develop either flanges or a plaited ropelike
    appearance, hence the name “cord roots.” To date, cord roots have been reported
    only in species of the legume tribe Mirbelieae, where this trait appears to be
    restricted to a number of species of Daviesia and single species in each of the
    related genera Euchilopsis and Phyllota (Pate et al. 1989; Pate and Dixon 1996).
    Cord roots have not been reported previously in species of these genera occurring
    outside the Kwongan,but species of Daviesia with normal (unistelar) secondary
    thickening in their roots coexist with cord-rooted congeners (Pate and Dixon 1996).
    No unique function has been found for cord-root anatomy. However, coexistence
    of species with and without cord-root anatomy does not rule out differential responses
    in the two root types to a common environmental stress or adaptation to different
    microhabitats in the same community.
