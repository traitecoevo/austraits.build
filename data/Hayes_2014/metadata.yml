  description: Investigation into foliar nutrient concentrations and resorption efficiencies
    of plants growing along a dune chronosequence in Jurien Bay, Western Australia
  basis_of_record: field

  sampling_strategy: 'STUDY AREA AND STUDY SITE The > 2-million-year Jurien Bay dune
    chronosequence is located in south-western Australia, approximately 200 km north
    of Perth. A detailed description of the dune chronosequence is presented in Laliberte
    et al. (2012). Essentially, the Jurien Bay dune chronosequence consists of a series
    of overlapping dune systems within ~10 km of the coast; the dunes were deposited
    during various periods of high sea level from the Early Pleistocene (and possibly
    Late Pliocene) to the present (Laliberte et al. 2012). The different dune systems
    increase in age with distance from the coast and have not been buried by younger
    sediments. As a result, they have been exposed to weathering since their deposition,
    thus creating a clear west-east soil age gradient. This soil age gradient is associated
    with large changes in soil nutrient availability and the type of nutrient limitation
    (Laliberte et al. 2012, 2013; Uren & Parsons 2013) that match expectations from
    the Walker & Syers (1976) model of soil development. Indeed, a previous nutrient-limitation
    bioassay showed that plant growth is N-limited on very young dunes [although potassium
    (K) or micronutrients may also play a role], co-limited by N, P and/or other nutrients
    on intermediate-aged dunes, and P-limited on old dunes (hundreds of thousands
    to millions of years old; Laliberte et al. 2012). We used the same five chronosequence
    stages as studied in Laliberte et al. (2012), with the exception of stage 1, which
    in the present study represented young mobile dunes with established vegetation
    instead of unvegetated mobile dunes as used by Laliberte et al. (2012). The main
    geological and edaphic characteristics of these five chronosequence stages are
    summarized in Table 1. The climate of the study area is Mediterranean, with hot,
    dry summers and cool, wet winters. Mean annual rainfall (1968-2013) is 538 mm,
    ~80% of which falls between May and September. Mean annual maximum temperature
    is 25 deg C, with the warmest mean monthly maximum temperature being 31 deg C
    (February) and the coolest 20 deg C (July; Australian Bureau of Meteorology, http://www.bom.
    gov.au/climate/data/). In the 12 months prior to sampling (June 2011 to May 2012),
    the annual rainfall was 553 mm and the monthly maximum temperature was 26 deg
    C (Australian Bureau of Meteorology, http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/data/). Fire
    is the main disturbance in the area, with typical fire-return intervals of < 30
    years (Department of Conservation & Land Management 1995). ^p SITE SELECTION For
    leaf sampling, we used 50 plots (10 x 10 m each) where vegetation had been characterized
    previously (G. Zemunik, unpublished data). In each plot, seven 2 x 2 m subplots
    were positioned randomly. All individual plants were counted and identified to
    species in each 2 x 2 m subplot. The percentage canopy cover of each species was
    also estimated (i.e. projection of live foliage on ground). Relative cover (%)
    of each species per plot was then estimated as a fraction of total canopy cover
    over the seven subplots. Locations for the 10 x 10 m plots were selected using
    a random stratified sampling design. First, aerial photographs, maps (i.e. soil,
    geology and topography) and on-ground verification (e.g. using soil morphological
    characteristics) were used to define six broad regions corresponding to distinct
    dune systems and/or soil types. These six regions were spread over a ~450 km2
    (i.e. approximately 45 km north-south 9 10 km east-west) coastal area from south
    of Jurien Bay to Green Head. Secondly, these regions were digitized as polygons
    in a geographical information system (Quantum GIS, http:// qgis.org/). Thirdly,
    all vehicle-accessible roads and tracks from the general area were also digitised
    into the GIS. Finally, randomly-positioned points within each of the six distinct
    dune systems were generated in the GIS, constraining locations between 40 and
    200 m from a road or track in order to facilitate access. Due to the relatively
    small sizes of vegetation patches within the youngest dune system (i.e. stage
    1; young mobile dunes), locations were randomly selected without consideration
    to road or track proximity. Ten plots per dune system were selected for vegetation
    surveys, for a total of 60 plots. However, we only used five of these dune systems
    in this study (i.e. 50 plots total), excluding one of the two Spearwood dune subsystems
    used for vegetation surveys. The average closest distance between two neighbouring
    plots was 2.1 km. This was deemed large enough to minimize the potential for spatial
    autocorrelation to influence the results. ^p SPECIES SELECTION Using the vegetation
    survey data (G. Zemunik, unpublished data), we ranked species in each of the five
    chronosequence stages from the most to the least abundant, based on canopy cover
    estimates. We then selected 5-7 species from each stage, targeting the most-abundant
    species for each of four contrasting nutrient-acquisition strategies: arbuscular
    mycorrhizal (AM), ectomycorrhizal (EM), N2-fixing (NF) and non-mycorrhizal (NM).
    Ericoid mycorrhizal species were not considered because they were not among the
    most-abundant species. The nutrient-acquisition strategy of each species was identified
    based on available evidence in the literature and for most species was based on
    information known at the genus level. We note that N2-fixing species are generally
    arbuscular and/or ectomycorrhizal, but we considered them as a separate group
    because they often show high leaf [N] (McKey 1994; Vergutz et al. 2012). Species
    were selected from the 10 most-abundant species per stage, with the exception
    of stage 4 where the 18 most-abundant species were considered. The selected species
    accounted for between 38% (stage 5) and 65% (stage 1) of the total canopy cover
    of each stage (Table 2). A total of 18 species were selected for leaf sampling
    across all five chronosequence stages (Table 2).'

  trait_name: leaf_Ca_per_dry_mass
  entity_type: individual
  value_type: raw
  basis_of_value: measurement
  replicates: 1
  methods: LEAF SAMPLING  All leaf material was collected over a two-month period
    between late March and early May 2012, near the end of the dry summer season.
    In each of the 50 plots, only healthy mature individuals were selected for sampling.
    In general, mature and senesced leaves were sampled from one individual plant
    per species in each plot, and all leaves were bulked per species for each of the
    50 plots. A species was considered absent from a plot if it could not be found
    within ~30 m of its centre. The number of individual collections (one collection
    = both mature and senesced leaves) per species in each chronosequence stage ranged
    from five to 10. In each case, representative samples of mature and senesced leaves
    were collected using nitrile gloves in order to minimize sample contamination.
    Leaves were not washed prior to nutrient analyses but we consider dust contamination
    to be highly unlikely, given the sandy nature of the soils. Mature leaves were
    undamaged, fully expanded and exposed to full sunlight. LEAF NUTRIENT ANALYSES  Each
    leaf sample was oven-dried (70  deg C, 48 h) and finely ground using a Teflon-coated
    stainless steel ball mill. A subsample was acid-digested using concentrated HNO3:HClO4
    (3:1) and analysed for Ca, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Mo, P, S and Zn concentrations using
    inductively coupled plasma optical-emission spectrometry (ICP-OES; ChemCentre,
    Perth, WA, Australia). All digests were first analysed using a simultaneous Varian
    Vista Pro (Varian Australia Pty Ltd, Mulgrave, Victoria, Australia), radially
    configured ICP-OES equipment fitted with a charge-coupled device (CCD) detection
    system and an A.I. Scientific AIM-3600 auto-sampler. Samples with P concentrations
    close to minimum reporting limit were rerun on more sensitive axially-configured
    ICP-OES equipment.

    were collected using nitrile gloves in order to minimize sample contamination.
    Leaves were not washed prior to nutrient analyses but we consider dust contamination
    to be highly unlikely, given the sandy nature of the soils. In most cases, senesced
    leaves were collected directly from the plant by gently shaking the plant and
    collecting fallen leaves. Senesced leaves were easily distinguished from green
    leaves, since they were yellow or brown and detached easily from the plant. However,
    for a few species, it was not possible to collect senesced leaves from live plants,
    in which case senesced leaves were collected directly beneath the plant from recently
    fallen litter. In all cases, there was no visible degradation of senesced leaves
    collected from this litter, which had predominantly fallen during the summer and
    had not been exposed to any significant rain between litter fall and collection.
    Therefore, we assumed that losses of nutrients through leaching or decomposition
    were minimal, although some photodegradation (Austin & Vivanco 2006) might have
    occurred. LEAF NUTRIENT ANALYSES  Each leaf sample was oven-dried (70  deg C,

  entity_type: individual
  value_type: raw
  basis_of_value: measurement
  replicates: 1
  methods: LEAF SAMPLING  All leaf material was collected over a two-month period
    between late March and early May 2012, near the end of the dry summer season.
    In each of the 50 plots, only healthy mature individuals were selected for sampling.
    In general, mature and senesced leaves were sampled from one individual plant
    per species in each plot, and all leaves were bulked per species for each of the
    50 plots. A species was considered absent from a plot if it could not be found
    within ~30 m of its centre. The number of individual collections (one collection
    = both mature and senesced leaves) per species in each chronosequence stage ranged
    from five to 10. In each case, representative samples of mature and senesced leaves
    were collected using nitrile gloves in order to minimize sample contamination.
    Leaves were not washed prior to nutrient analyses but we consider dust contamination
    to be highly unlikely, given the sandy nature of the soils. In most cases, senesced
    leaves were collected directly from the plant by gently shaking the plant and
    collecting fallen leaves. Senesced leaves were easily distinguished from green
    leaves, since they were yellow or brown and detached easily from the plant. However,
    for a few species, it was not possible to collect senesced leaves from live plants,
    in which case senesced leaves were collected directly beneath the plant from recently
    fallen litter. In all cases, there was no visible degradation of senesced leaves
    collected from this litter, which had predominantly fallen during the summer and
    had not been exposed to any significant rain between litter fall and collection.
    Therefore, we assumed that losses of nutrients through leaching or decomposition
    were minimal, although some photodegradation (Austin & Vivanco 2006) might have
    occurred. LEAF NUTRIENT ANALYSES  Each leaf sample was oven-dried (70  deg C,
    48 h) and finely ground using a Teflon-coated stainless steel ball mill. A subsample
    was acid-digested using concentrated HNO3:HClO4 (3:1) and analysed for Ca, Cu,
    Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Mo, P, S and Zn concentrations using inductively coupled plasma
    optical-emission spectrometry (ICP-OES; ChemCentre, Perth, WA, Australia). All
    digests were first analysed using a simultaneous Varian Vista Pro (Varian Australia
    Pty Ltd, Mulgrave, Victoria, Australia), radially configured ICP-OES equipment
    fitted with a charge-coupled device (CCD) detection system and an A.I. Scientific
    AIM-3600 auto-sampler. Samples with P concentrations close to minimum reporting
    limit were rerun on more sensitive axially-configured ICP-OES equipment.
