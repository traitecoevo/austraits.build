  description: Investigation into foliar nutrient concentrations and resorption efficiencies
    of plants growing along a dune chronosequence in Jurien Bay, Western Australia

  sampling_strategy: 'STUDY AREA AND STUDY SITE The > 2-million-year Jurien Bay dune
    chronosequence is located in south-western Australia, approximately 200 km north
    of Perth. A detailed description of the dune chronosequence is presented in Laliberte
    et al. (2012). Essentially, the Jurien Bay dune chronosequence consists of a series
    of overlapping dune systems within ~10 km of the coast; the dunes were deposited
    during various periods of high sea level from the Early Pleistocene (and possibly
    Late Pliocene) to the present (Laliberte et al. 2012). The different dune systems
    increase in age with distance from the coast and have not been buried by younger
    sediments. As a result, they have been exposed to weathering since their deposition,
    thus creating a clear west<U+FFFD>east soil age gradient. This soil age gradient
    is associated with large changes in soil nutrient availability and the type of
    nutrient limitation (Laliberte et al. 2012, 2013; Uren & Parsons 2013) that match
    expectations from the Walker & Syers (1976) model of soil development. Indeed,
    a previous nutrient-limitation bioassay showed that plant growth is N-limited
    on very young dunes [although potassium (K) or micronutrients may also play a
    role], co-limited by N, P and/or other nutrients on intermediate-aged dunes, and
    P-limited on old dunes (hundreds of thousands to millions of years old; Laliberte
    et al. 2012). We used the same five chronosequence stages as studied in Laliberte
    et al. (2012), with the exception of stage 1, which in the present study represented
    young mobile dunes with established vegetation instead of unvegetated mobile dunes
    as used by Laliberte et al. (2012). The main geological and edaphic characteristics
    of these five chronosequence stages are summarized in Table 1. The climate of
    the study area is Mediterranean, with hot, dry summers and cool, wet winters.
    Mean annual rainfall (1968<U+FFFD>2013) is 538 mm, ~80% of which falls between
    May and September. Mean annual maximum temperature is 25 deg C, with the warmest
    mean monthly maximum temperature being 31 deg C (February) and the coolest 20
    deg C (July; Australian Bureau of Meteorology, http://www.bom. gov.au/climate/data/).
    In the 12 months prior to sampling (June 2011 to May 2012), the annual rainfall
    was 553 mm and the monthly maximum temperature was 26 <U+FFFD>C (Australian Bureau
    of Meteorology, http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/data/). Fire is the main disturbance
    in the area, with typical fire-return intervals of < 30 years (Department of Conservation
    & Land Management 1995). ^p SITE SELECTION For leaf sampling, we used 50 plots
    (10 x 10 m each) where vegetation had been characterized previously (G. Zemunik,
    unpublished data). In each plot, seven 2 x 2 m subplots were positioned randomly.
    All individual plants were counted and identified to species in each 2 x 2 m subplot.
    The percentage canopy cover of each species was also estimated (i.e. projection
    of live foliage on ground). Relative cover (%) of each species per plot was then
    estimated as a fraction of total canopy cover over the seven subplots. Locations
    for the 10 x 10 m plots were selected using a random stratified sampling design.
    First, aerial photographs, maps (i.e. soil, geology and topography) and on-ground
    verification (e.g. using soil morphological characteristics) were used to define
    six broad regions corresponding to distinct dune systems and/or soil types. These
    six regions were spread over a ~450 km2 (i.e. approximately 45 km north-south
    9 10 km east-west) coastal area from south of Jurien Bay to Green Head. Secondly,
    these regions were digitized as polygons in a geographical information system
    (Quantum GIS, http:// qgis.org/). Thirdly, all vehicle-accessible roads and tracks
    from the general area were also digitised into the GIS. Finally, randomly-positioned
    points within each of the six distinct dune systems were generated in the GIS,
    constraining locations between 40 and 200 m from a road or track in order to facilitate
    access. Due to the relatively small sizes of vegetation patches within the youngest
    dune system (i.e. stage 1; young mobile dunes), locations were randomly selected
    without consideration to road or track proximity. Ten plots per dune system were
    selected for vegetation surveys, for a total of 60 plots. However, we only used
    five of these dune systems in this study (i.e. 50 plots total), excluding one
    of the two Spearwood dune subsystems used for vegetation surveys. The average
    closest distance between two neighbouring plots was 2.1 km. This was deemed large
    enough to minimize the potential for spatial autocorrelation to influence the
    results. ^p SPECIES SELECTION Using the vegetation survey data (G. Zemunik, unpublished
    data), we ranked species in each of the five chronosequence stages from the most
    to the least abundant, based on canopy cover estimates. We then selected 5<U+FFFD>7
    species from each stage, targeting the most-abundant species for each of four
    contrasting nutrient-acquisition strategies: arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM), ectomycorrhizal
    (EM), N2-fixing (NF) and non-mycorrhizal (NM). Ericoid mycorrhizal species were
    not considered because they were not among the most-abundant species. The nutrient-acquisition
    strategy of each species was identified based on available evidence in the literature
    and for most species was based on information known at the genus level. We note
    that N2-fixing species are generally arbuscular and/or ectomycorrhizal, but we
    considered them as a separate group because they often show high leaf [N] (McKey
    1994; Vergutz et al. 2012). Species were selected from the 10 most-abundant species
    per stage, with the exception of stage 4 where the 18 most-abundant species were
    considered. The selected species accounted for between 38% (stage 5) and 65% (stage
    1) of the total canopy cover of each stage (Table 2). A total of 18 species were
    selected for leaf sampling across all five chronosequence stages (Table 2).'

  methods: LEAF SAMPLING  All leaf material was collected over a two-month period
    between late March and early May 2012, near the end of the dry summer season.
    In each of the 50 plots, only healthy mature individuals were selected for sampling.
    In general, mature and senesced leaves were sampled from one individual plant
    per species in each plot, and all leaves were bulked per species for each of the
    50 plots. A species was considered absent from a plot if it could not be found
    within ~30 m of its centre. The number of individual collections (one collection
    = both mature and senesced leaves) per species in each chronosequence stage ranged
    from five to 10. In each case, representative samples of mature and senesced leaves
    were collected using nitrile gloves in order to minimize sample contamination.
    Leaves were not washed prior to nutrient analyses but we consider dust contamination
    to be highly unlikely, given the sandy nature of the soils. Mature leaves were
    undamaged, fully expanded and exposed to full sunlight. LEAF NUTRIENT ANALYSES  Each
    leaf sample was oven-dried (70  deg C, 48 h) and finely ground using a Teflon-coated
    stainless steel ball mill. A subsample was acid-digested using concentrated HNO3:HClO4
    (3:1) and analysed for Ca, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Mo, P, S and Zn concentrations using
    inductively coupled plasma optical-emission spectrometry (ICP-OES; ChemCentre,
    Perth, WA, Australia). All digests were first analysed using a simultaneous Varian
    Vista Pro (Varian Australia Pty Ltd, Mulgrave, Victoria, Australia), radially
    configured ICP-OES equipment fitted with a charge-coupled device (CCD) detection
    system and an A.I. Scientific AIM-3600 auto-sampler. Samples with P concentrations
    close to minimum reporting limit were rerun on more sensitive axially-configured
    ICP-OES equipment.

    Leaves were not washed prior to nutrient analyses but we consider dust contamination

    leaves were collected directly from the plant by gently shaking the plant and
    collecting fallen leaves. Senesced leaves were easily distinguished from green
    leaves, since they were yellow or brown and detached easily from the plant. However,
    for a few species, it was not possible to collect senesced leaves from live plants,
    in which case senesced leaves were collected directly beneath the plant from recently
    fallen litter. In all cases, there was no visible degradation of senesced leaves
    collected from this litter, which had predominantly fallen during the summer and
    had not been exposed to any significant rain between litter fall and collection.
    Therefore, we assumed that losses of nutrients through leaching or decomposition
    were minimal, although some photodegradation (Austin & Vivanco 2006) might have

    collected from this litter, which had predominantly fallen during the summer and
    had not been exposed to any significant rain between litter fall and collection.
    Therefore, we assumed that losses of nutrients through leaching or decomposition
    were minimal, although some photodegradation (Austin & Vivanco 2006) might have
    occurred. LEAF NUTRIENT ANALYSES  Each leaf sample was oven-dried (70  deg C,
    48 h) and finely ground using a Teflon-coated stainless steel ball mill. A subsample
    was acid-digested using concentrated HNO3:HClO4 (3:1) and analysed for Ca, Cu,
    Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Mo, P, S and Zn concentrations using inductively coupled plasma
    optical-emission spectrometry (ICP-OES; ChemCentre, Perth, WA, Australia). All
    digests were first analysed using a simultaneous Varian Vista Pro (Varian Australia
    Pty Ltd, Mulgrave, Victoria, Australia), radially configured ICP-OES equipment
    fitted with a charge-coupled device (CCD) detection system and an A.I. Scientific
    AIM-3600 auto-sampler. Samples with P concentrations close to minimum reporting
    limit were rerun on more sensitive axially-configured ICP-OES equipment.

  methods: LEAF SAMPLING  All leaf material was collected over a two-month period
    between late March and early May 2012, near the end of the dry summer season.
    In each of the 50 plots, only healthy mature individuals were selected for sampling.
    In general, mature and senesced leaves were sampled from one individual plant
    per species in each plot, and all leaves were bulked per species for each of the
    50 plots. A species was considered absent from a plot if it could not be found
    within ~30 m of its centre. The number of individual collections (one collection
    = both mature and senesced leaves) per species in each chronosequence stage ranged
    from five to 10. In each case, representative samples of mature and senesced leaves
    were collected using nitrile gloves in order to minimize sample contamination.
    Leaves were not washed prior to nutrient analyses but we consider dust contamination
    to be highly unlikely, given the sandy nature of the soils. In most cases, senesced
    leaves were collected directly from the plant by gently shaking the plant and
    collecting fallen leaves. Senesced leaves were easily distinguished from green
    leaves, since they were yellow or brown and detached easily from the plant. However,
    for a few species, it was not possible to collect senesced leaves from live plants,
    in which case senesced leaves were collected directly beneath the plant from recently
    fallen litter. In all cases, there was no visible degradation of senesced leaves
    collected from this litter, which had predominantly fallen during the summer and
    had not been exposed to any significant rain between litter fall and collection.
