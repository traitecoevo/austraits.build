  description: Study investigating the post-fire regeneration strategies of three
    Banksia species in relation to fire were studied over 20 years in a mediterranean
    heathland-shrubland on the south coast of Western Australia.
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: The three species studied, Banksia baxteri R.Br., B. baueri R.Br.
    and B. nutans R.Br., occur only on the south coast of Western Australia. All were
    common in the study area on deep sand in sclerophyllous mediterranean shrubland
    and heathland at the western end of the Fitzgerald River National Park (34°12'S,
    119°22'E). This park is a large area (350 000 ha) of native vegetation, over half
    of which consists of a marine plain and associated vegetation systems in which
    we worked. The three banksias studied occur as widespread, intermingled and major
    components of this vegetation, each representing about 6-30% of canopy cover (Chapman
    and Newbey 1995). Banksia baxteri is a shrub to 4 m tall; B. nutans and B. baueri
    are both bushes to 1-2 m tall and 1-2 m wide. ^p A constellation of three sites
    5-10 km apart, whose fire histories were known from personal experience, were
    monitored from 1983 to 2001. One area (Site A) burnt in 1980, had not been burnt
    for at least 20 years before that. Another area (Site B) unburnt for at least
    40 years at the start of the study remained unburnt. At the third site (Site C),
    also long unburnt at the start of the study, part of the area (Site C1) was burnt
    in a wildfire in December 1989, while the remainder (Site C2) remained unburnt
    until a management fire in May 1998. At each site, the number of inflorescences
    per plant was counted in most years on at least 40 plants of each species, selected
    at random. Thus, it was possible to monitor the onset of flowering at Site A over
    19 years and at Site C over 12 and 3 years after fire and to compare them with
    nearby, similar vegetation long unburnt (Site B). This method helped to reduce
    the problems associated with overlapping chronosequences in which differences
    between sites may obscure temporal patterns (Whelan 1995). For each of the three
    species, the numbers of infructescences per plant were counted at Site C1 10 years
    after fire, at Site A 20 years after fire and at Site B more than 40 years after
    fire. At burnt sites, seedling density was determined from fifty x 1 m 2 quadrats
    for the first 3 years after fire, then twenty x 6.25 m 2 quadrats up to 10 years
    after fire; thereafter, total counts of all individuals of each species were made
    within 50 x 50 m grids established for animal trapping. Each of the three species
    had readily distinguishable leaves, even at the seedling stage, facilitating density
    estimates.
