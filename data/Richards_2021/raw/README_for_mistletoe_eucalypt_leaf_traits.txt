Metadata for mistletoe_eucalypt_leaf_traits.csv

day/month/year: Date samples were collected in the field

location: One of four regions (Marysville, Avoca, Little Desert, and Hattah), each of which contain one or more sample sites. See below for additional location description.

site: Collection site within a location. Sites were separated by elevation of approx 150m (Marysville, Pyrenees State Forest) and/or distance of at least 5 km.

type: Mistletoe (M) or eucalypt (T)

id: identifying number given to a mistletoe/eucalypt pair. 

leaf: A letter (A-E) was assigned to each of the five leaves from an individual mistletoe or eucalypt. Leaves were tracked individually through all measurements.

unique_id: A combination of type, id, and leaf that uniquely identifies each leaf sampled.

species: Latin genus and (where possible to determine) specific epipthet. Where individuals were not able to be positively identified to species because they lacked reproductive material, they were assigned a morphospecies id.

leaf_area: Surface area of one side of the leaf (cm^2).

leafthick: Average of three measurements of leaf thickness taken at different points along the lamina avoiding major veins (mm).

ldmc: Leaf Dry Matter Content, the ratio of dry mass to fresh mass for each leaf (mg g^-1)

sla: Specific Leaf Area, the ratio of leaf surface area to leaf dry mass (cm^2 mg^-1)

C: Percent carbon by dry mass (%, mg mg^-1). Nutrients were measured on only one leaf per plant.

N: Percent nitrogen by dry mass (%, mg mg^-1). Nutrients were measured on only one leaf per plant.

cn_ratio: Carbon to nitrogen ratio. Nutrients were measured on only one leaf per plant.

C13: Delta 13C, a measure of carbon 13 enrichment. Nutrients were measured on only one leaf per plant.

N15: Delta 15N, a measure of nitrogen 15 enrichment. Nutrients were measured on only one leaf per plant.

chlor2: mND705 index for chlorophyll content, based on reflectance at wavelengths of 445, 705, and 750nm (Sims and Gamon 2002).

caro: PRI index for the carotenoid to chlorophyll ratio, based on reflectance at wavelengths of 531 and 570 nm. The index decreases linearly with the carotenoid:chlorophyll ratio (Sims and Gamon 2002).

density: dry matter per cubic area, calculated as the inverse of SLA divided by leaf thickness (g cm^3)

swc: Saturated Water Content, calculated as the difference between wet mass and dry mass divided by dry mass (mg mg^-1)

Narea: Nitrogen per area, calculated as SLA divided by percent N (g cm^-2)

lat/lon: GPS coordinates of host Eucalyptus tree.

mat: Mean Annaul Temperature, extracted from Worldclim at a resolution of 30 seconds based on GPS coordinates

precip: Mean Annual Precipitation, extracted from Worldclim at a resolution of 30 seconds based on GPS coordinates

evap: Mean Annual Pan Evaporation, extracted from the Australian Bureau of Meterology at .25 degree resolution based on GPS coordinates. 

pep: Calculated for each site as mean annual precipitation divided by mean annual pan evaporation.

LOCATION DESCRIPTIONS:
MARYSVILLE: Because three of the sites in the Marysville occurred along an elevation gradient in the Rubicon State Forest, this location contains a third of the total variation across the P/Ep gradient. Sites were selected along the roadside of a National Forest road that ran through the park at  approximately 150m intervals in elevation. The two upper elevation sites may be classified as temperate rainforest, receiving considerable rainfall throughout the year and cooler temperatures, resulting in the highest P/Ep values (1.421 and 1.194 mm mm-1). These sites supported tall-statured forest mainly dominated by Eucalyptus regnans at the upper extent. The lowest elevation Marysville site was mixed Eucalyptus woodland, with a slightly lower P/Ep value (0.883 mm mm-1) than the higher elevation sites at this location. 

AVOCA: Three sites around Avoca in the Bealiba-Barp State Forest and the Pyrenees State Forest also represented mixed Eucalyptus woodland. Here the trees were of shorter stature than in the Marysville location and sites were dominated by a mix of Eucalyptus in the box, stringybark, and gum groups. P/Ep values varied from 0.381 to 0.524 mm mm-1.

LITTLE DESERT & HATTAH: The final three sites were split between the Little Desert National Park and Hattah State Forest/Hattah-Kulkyne National Park and represented mallee scrub habitat dominated by short-statured, multi-stemmed eucalypts in the mallee group. Soils in these sites were sandier than at the wetter sites, and receive both less rainfall and greater solar insolation  resulting in higher rates of total evapotranspiration (P/Ep values of 0.116 to 0.287 mm mm-1).
