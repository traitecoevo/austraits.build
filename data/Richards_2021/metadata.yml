  description: Study comparing leaf functional traits in mistletoes and their Eucalyptus
    (Myrtaceae) hosts in response to a climatic gradient of relative moisture supply
    from tall wet sclerophyll forest and temperate rainforest to arid mallee in Victoria,
    Australia.
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: In August 2018, we collected leaf samples from 55 mistletoe-host
    pairs (Table S1), including four species of mistletoes and 17 of Eucalyptus, at
    nine well-drained, upland sites in five state forests and national parks that
    span a substantial gradient in relative moisture supply (Table 1). ^p Sample collection
    ^p We haphazardly selected mistletoe-host pairs along roadsides at each site.
    To collect leaves, we launched weight bags attached to a line by hand or slingshot
    over infected tree branches with sun-exposed leaves, and then pulled mistletoe
    and eucalypt branches to the ground. Eucalypt leaves were always collected from
    the mistletoe host plant, but not always from the same branch infected by the
    mistletoe. From each branch, we collected five healthy, fully expanded leaves.
    Flowers or fruits, if present, were collected to aid in species identification.
    All samples were placed in plastic bags and kept in insulated containers prior
    to trait measurements.

    notes: Because three of the sites in the Marysville occurred along an elevation

      total variation across the P/Ep gradient. Sites were selected along the roadside
      of a National Forest road that ran through the park at  approximately 150m intervals
      in elevation. The two upper elevation sites may be classified as temperate rainforest,
      receiving considerable rainfall throughout the year and cooler temperatures,
      resulting in the highest P/Ep values (1.421 and 1.194 mm mm-1). These sites
      supported tall-statured forest mainly dominated by Eucalyptus regnans at the
      upper extent. The lowest elevation Marysville site was mixed Eucalyptus woodland,
      with a slightly lower P/Ep value (0.883 mm mm-1) than the higher elevation sites
      at this location.

    and eucalypt branches to the ground. Eucalypt leaves were always collected from

    mistletoe. From each branch, we collected five healthy, fully expanded leaves.
    All samples were placed in plastic bags and kept in insulated containers prior
    to trait measurements. We measured leaf area (cm2) from a photograph of the fresh
    leaf using ImageJ (version 1.52 h, National Institutes of Health). Photos were

    three places along the lamina avoiding major veins using a thickness gauge micrometer
    (B.C. Ames). The three measurements were averaged per leaf.

    All samples were placed in plastic bags and kept in insulated containers prior
    to trait measurements. We calculated leaf density (g dry mass cm-3), or dry matter
    per cubic area, calculated as the inverse of SLA divided by leaf thickness. Using
    fresh leaves, we measured leaf thickness in three places along the lamina using
    a thickness gauge micrometer (B.C. Ames). To determine SLA, each dried leaf was
    weighed and area calculated from a photograph of the fresh leaf using ImageJ (version
    1.52 h, National Institutes of Health). Photos were corrected for lens distortion
    using PTLens (ePaperPress).

    To collect leaves, we launched weight bags attached to a line by hand or slingshot
    over infected tree branches with sun-exposed leaves, and then pulled mistletoe
    and eucalypt branches to the ground. Eucalypt leaves were always collected from
    the mistletoe host plant, but not always from the same branch infected by the
    mistletoe. From each branch, we collected five healthy, fully expanded leaves.
    All samples were placed in plastic bags and kept in insulated containers prior
    to trait measurements. We calculated saturated water content ([g fresh mass-g
    dry mass]/g-1 dry mass) as the difference between wet mass and dry mass divided
    by dry mass.

    All samples were placed in plastic bags and kept in insulated containers prior
    to trait measurements. We measured leaf N per area (g N cm-2 leaf area), calculated
    as SLA divided by percent N. To determine SLA, each dried leaf was weighed and
    area calculated from a photograph of the fresh leaf using ImageJ (version 1.52
    h, National Institutes of Health). Photos were corrected for lens distortion using
    PTLens (ePaperPress). To determine percent N, leaves were dried in silica gel
    and transported to Wisconsin, USA where they were oven-dried at 50 °C for 72 h,
    then weighed on a Mettler Toledo analytical balance. After drying, one leaf per
    plant was randomly selected for elemental analysis. We prepared each sample by
    grinding in a Wiley Mill, packing 3-5 mg of leaf grounds in tin capsules, and
    sending them to the Idaho State University Stable Isotope Lab for leaf carbon,
    nitrogen, delta13C, and delta15N analysis. Analyses used a 2010 ThermoFisher Delta
    V Plus continuous flow isotope ratio mass spectrometer coupled with ConFlo IV/EA,
    TC/EA, and GasBench II.
