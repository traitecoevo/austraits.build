  description: Study comparing leaf functional traits in mistletoes and their Eucalyptus
    (Myrtaceae) hosts in response to a climatic gradient of relative moisture supply
    from tall wet sclerophyll forest and temperate rainforest to arid mallee in Victoria,
    Australia.
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: unknown
  sampling_strategy: In August 2018, we collected leaf samples from 55 mistletoe–host
    pairs (Table S1), including four species of mistletoes and 17 of Eucalyptus, at
    nine well-drained, upland sites in five state forests and national parks that
    span a substantial gradient in relative moisture supply (Table 1). ^p Sample collection
    ^p We haphazardly selected mistletoe–host pairs along roadsides at each site.
    To collect leaves, we launched weight bags attached to a line by hand or slingshot
    over infected tree branches with sun-exposed leaves, and then pulled mistletoe
    and eucalypt branches to the ground. Eucalypt leaves were always collected from
    the mistletoe host plant, but not always from the same branch infected by the
    mistletoe. From each branch, we collected five healthy, fully expanded leaves.
    Flowers or fruits, if present, were collected to aid in species identification.
    All samples were placed in plastic bags and kept in insulated containers prior
    to trait measurements.
