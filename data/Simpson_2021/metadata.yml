  description: Study investigating associations between fire regimes experienced by
    hundreds of grass species and their persistence strategy, within a phylogenetic
    context. The study also tested whether persistence strategies are associated with
    morphological and physiological traits.
  basis_of_record: literature
  life_stage: adult
  source_id: source_id
  sampling_strategy: Grass species' persistence strategies through fire were collected
    from a literature review, drawing upon large plant fire-response databases (e.g.
    Cook et al., 2005; Crowley et al., 2007; Paula et al., 2009), journal papers (e.g.
    du Toit et al., 2014; Marais et al., 2014; Moore et al., 2019) and the grey literature
    (such as Government reports regarding fire management strategies or control of
    invasive species). Data from sources already known to the authors were extracted
    first, followed by a targeted approach for species for which we had fire characteristic
    data. The latter was achieved by using the Web of Knowledge and Google Scholar
    search engines (to incorporate both the primary and grey literature) for the term
    '[species name] fire response'.

  methods: Grass species' persistence strategies through fire were collected from
    a literature review, drawing upon large plant fire-response databases (e.g. Cook
    et al., 2005; Crowley et al., 2007; Paula et al., 2009), journal papers (e.g.
    du Toit et al., 2014; Marais et al., 2014; Moore et al., 2019) and the grey literature
    (such as Government reports regarding fire management strategies or control of
    invasive species). Data from sources already known to the authors were extracted
    first, followed by a targeted approach for species for which we had fire characteristic
    data. The latter was achieved by using the Web of Knowledge and Google Scholar
    search engines (to incorporate both the primary and grey literature) for the term
    '[species name] fire response'. We classed species as either 'seeders' or 'resprouters'
    based on the response specifically to fire and not to other disturbances, as fire
    not only defoliates a plant (similar to other disturbances), but it also has lethal
    effects on meristem tissues (Pausas et al., 2016). Resprouters were defined in
    a number of ways depending upon the type of data available. For categorical data,
    resprouting species were defined as those where resprouting is the main post-fire
    persistence strategy. In a few cases, the ability to resprout was given in relation
    to fire characteristics (e.g. 'plants will recover from an occasional, but not
    annual, fire'), and these were classed as resprouters because they showed an ability
    to resprout after fire. For quantitative data, species that experienced < 30%
    mortality when subjected to 100% leaf scorch were classed as resprouters (sensu
    Crowley et al., 2007). Conversely, a species was classified as a seeder if the
    main post-fire persistence strategy was germinating from seed (which could be
    either from a stored soil seedbank or from seeds dispersed into a recently burnt
    area), or if plants of this species experienced > 70% mortality when subjected
    to 100% leaf scorch. In addition, annual species for which no response to fire
    could be found by searching the literature were assumed to be seeders, unless
    there was evidence to the contrary (n = 27).

  methods: Data on plant traits which we thought may be associated with the ability
    to resprout (Table 1) were collected from a number of sources. Photosynthetic
    type was acquired from Osborne et al. (2014), and bud position from the Kew GrassBase
    dataset (Clayton et al., 2006). The latter involved the assignment of categories
    of bud position -- belowground buds (species with rhizomes) or buds at ground-level
    (species with stolons or crown resprouters, defined as caespitose species with
    neither rhizomes nor stolons).
