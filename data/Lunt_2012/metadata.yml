  description: Lunt, Morgan, Scarlett, Salmon, Angevin trait data 1990s-2012 via John
    Morgan. Data were collected from places including Mt Hotham Alpine Resort, Bogong
    High Plains, Wail State Forest, Victorian Volcanic Plains, Gippsland Plains.
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: Data were collected from places including Mt Hotham Alpine Resort,
    Bogong High Plains, Wail State Forest, Victorian Volcanic Plains, Gippsland Plains.
  original_file: relevent data from the file "2014  updated plant functional trait
    database.xls" extracted. Original copy of the excel file located in Google Drive
    in the folder "Morgan_2011_1 Morgan_2011_2 Morgan_2014 Angevin_2010 Briggs_2010
    Cross_2011 Lunt_2012 Roberts_2006 Scott_2010".
  notes: In John Morgan's original file (see above) the same SLA values are listed
    under reference 9 (Lunt, Morgan, Scarlett, Salmon, Angevin 1990s-2012) and reference
    10 (Venn, Angevin, Pickering). They are all included in this dataset; SLA values
    duplicated in Angevin_2011, Cross_2009, and Meers_2010 have been filtered out.
    There are a very few seed mass duplicate values from related labs, but these haven't
    been filtered.
