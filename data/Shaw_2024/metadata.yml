  description: A pathogenicity experiment was established with five oomycete treatments,
    three putatively native Phytophthora species, the invasive P. cinnamomi, and Pythium
    irregulare, to determine the damping-off host range in selected plant species
    from a hyper-diverse Mediterranean-type ecosystem. Additionally, plant and seed
    traits were analysed to determine if they were correlated with susceptibility
    to pre-emergent damping-off.
  basis_of_record: lab
  sampling_strategy: The Phytophthora species selected were isolated through soil
    bating in kwongan plant communities native to southwest Australia (Table 1). Phytophthora
    cinnamomi was included in the experiment as it is a known invasive species with
    a wide distribution across the southwest of Western Australia (SWWA). Pythium
    irregulare has often been isolated from kwongan communities in our preliminary
    studies, and by Laliberté et al. (2015), and from agricultural systems in WA (Li
    et al., 2014). Phytophthora and Pythium species inocula were grown in a vermiculite
    substrate (1 L vermiculite, 10 g millet seed, 600 mL V8 broth) for 5 weeks at
    20°C in the dark (Simamora et al., 2017). Additional sterile vermiculite substrate
    was prepared in the same way for the inoculation of negative control treatments.
    Punnets used in the experiment were inoculated with the oomycete or negative control
    treatments at 1% of the dry sand weight. ^p Thirty plant species were selected
    to provide sufficient data to identify if functional traits reflected susceptibility.
    The 30 species of plants (Table 2) were selected from three dominant plant families,
    Fabaceae, Myrtaceae, and Proteaceae (Zemunik et al., 2016). Species were selected
    based on seed availability, previous viability tests, importance in rehabilitation
    in the region, abundance in natural communities, and seed and plant traits. Seed
    mass, seed storage mechanism, nutrient acquisition strategy, symbiotic association
    with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, response to fire, and mature plant size were considered
    and balanced as evenly as possible when selecting plant species for the experiment
    (Table 2; Appendix Appendices S1). The traits selected for the analysis were related
    to recruitment or hypothesized to affect mature plant species susceptibility to
    soil-borne plant pathogens (Lambers et al., 2018). Germination treatments were
    undertaken as outlined in Sweedman and Merritt (2006). ^p The emergence and survival
    of 30 plant species were monitored in five oomycete treatments and a negative
    control. Seedling emergence and mortality were recorded to determine host susceptibility
    to the oomycete treatments compared to the negative control (Table 1). Seedlings
    were recorded as emergent when both cotyledons were visible above the soil surface
    and then marked with a wooden toothpick to indicate when mortality had occurred
    for a specific seedling. The experiment ran between 23 October 2016 and 21 March
    2017. The experiment was conducted in an evaporatively cooled glasshouse; temperatures
    ranged from 17 to 30°C. Each combination of oomycete treatment (6) and plant species
    (30) was replicated 10 times (1800 punnet-cells). ^p Each replicate consisted
    of three free-draining 10-cell punnets (345 x 144 x 80 mm). River sand was steamed
    twice in the punnets at 98°C for 2 h on consecutive days and allowed to cool before
    inoculation. Vermiculite inoculum was mixed into the sterile river sand before
    sowing. Then ten seeds of each plant species were sown into a single punnet cell
    (70 x 70 x 80 mm, 250 mL). Seeds were sown using a tool to produce a consistent
    pattern and hole depth. The position of the plant species within the replicates
    was randomly selected. Replicates were arranged in a randomized block design in
    the glasshouse and moved every 10 days. The punnets were hand-watered with de-ionized
    water every other day to run-off. The presence of the Phytophthora treatments
    was confirmed by removing dead seedlings from the cell and plating the roots on
    amended NARH agar (Simamora et al., 2018). Pythium irregulare was isolated using
    NARH agar with the hymexazol removed as it suppresses Pythium species (Kato et
    al., 1990; Tsao, 1983). At the end of the experiment, all punnets were baited,
    as described by O'Brien et al. (2009), to confirm the presence and survival of
    the Phytophthora and Pythium species.
