  description: Freya's thesis data; study examines the height growth trajectories in 18 woody plant species in a light-saturated, fire-prone, semi-arid environment as well as the influence of functional traits on those trajectories.
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: This study took advantage of fire histories within Murray Sunset National Park (Avitabile et al. 2013) to conduct a chronosequence study of plant species growth over time (Falster & Westoby 2005a; Muir et al. 2014). Eleven areas varying in time-since-fire (1,2,4,8,13,15, 26, 33, 36,46,86 years), were selected within a relatively small region of Murray Sunset National Park, sites encompassed a range of post-fire ages whilst restricting the amount of edaphic variation, and all areas were within Triodia Mallee. Between three and five different patches within a 'time-since-fire' area were surveyed, totaling 50 surveys across 11 areas. Eighteen woody plant species were selected that had at least three individuals across each of the 50 survey sites, a total of 1250 individual plants were sampled.

traits:
- var_in: SLA

  trait_name: specific_leaf_area
  value_type: site_mean
  replicates: 5
  methods: Guidance on sample sizes for measuring plant traits were followed from Cornelissen et al. (2003), and we took five samples (ie five leaves or five stem sections) from each of five individual plants for each species. Specific leaf area (SLA; mg mm2), the one-sided leaf surface area of fresh leaves divided by the mass of leaves oven-dried at 65 deg C for 48 h was measured for at least five leaves from each of five individuals for each species.

  methods: Guidance on sample sizes for measuring plant traits were followed from Cornelissen et al. (2003), and we took five samples (ie five leaves or five stem sections) from each of five individual plants for each species. Stem tissue density (dry mass per unit fresh volume; mg mm"3) was measured using 40â€“60 mm long, stem segments from at least five individuals per species. Samples were collected in the field and refrigerated before processing as soon as feasible. Stem tissue density was then determined following Archimedes principle using the protocol from Cornelissen et al. (2003).
- var_in: SD_MASS

  methods: Guidance on sample sizes for measuring plant traits were followed from Cornelissen et al. (2003), and we took five samples (ie five leaves or five stem sections) from each of five individual plants for each species. Seed mass (mg) was measured for as many species as possible with field-collected seed, oven-dried and weighed. Seed mass data were also supplemented from the literature and a global seed mass database (Moles & Westoby 2003).

  methods: Guidance on sample sizes for measuring plant traits were followed from Cornelissen et al. (2003), and we took five samples (ie five leaves or five stem sections) from each of five individual plants for each species. Leaf nitrogen concentrations (Nmass; %) were calculated on five fully expanded leaves taken from well-lit positions on each of five individuals per species. Leaves from each species were then pooled and finely ground for nitrogen analysis. Total nitrogen concentration based on mass (%) was measured using complete combustion gas chromatography performed by The Surface and Chemical Analysis Network at The University of Melbourne.

  methods: We measured heights of at least five (and up to 10) individuals per species in each time-since-fire area. Many species in this region resprout after fire, but for species with postfire seed regeneration, separate measurements were made on seedling and resprouting individuals. It is easy to determine seeded individuals from resprouting individuals when plants are young, but as they age it becomes increasingly difficult to have confidence of whether an individual seeded or resprouted. Additionally, we thought it likely that resprouters would generally outpace reseeders due to their underground resource stores, and so modelling both functional types together might conflate growth rates based on functional traits and inherently different growth mechanisms (Falster & Westoby 2005a). Due to this, Eucalyptus oleosa, Eucalyptus gracilis and Melaleuca lanceolata (the resprouting species) were left out of the trait-based multispecies model, and their growth was modelled separately to represent the resprouting species.
