  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: The study area is in Murray Sunset National Park, Victoria (34.7683
    deg S, 141.8542 deg E), a large conservation area within the semi-arid Murray
    Mallee region of south-eastern Australia. This region of Victoria has hot dry
    summers and cold winters. Mean annual rainfall is 290 mm, falling mostly in the
    cooler months from May-November, and mean maximum daily temperatures ranging from
    15.4 deg C in July to 32.3 deg C in January (BOM). ^p Two main soil formations
    occur in this area, The Lowan Sands and The Woorinen Formation, which differ in
    colour, sand grain size and grain surface features driven largely by differing
    clay content (Pell, Chivas and Williams 2001). The landscape is dominated by dune/swale
    systems, which reflect subtle but important variation in soil characteristics
    and moisture availabilities (White 2006). ^p The vegetation and fire histories
    of the Murray Mallee region of south-eastern Australia have previously been comprehensively
    mapped (Haslem et al. 2012; Avitabile et al. 2013). The most common vegetation
    type of the region is tree 'mallee' which is characterized by small multi-stemmed
    eucalypts (mallees) with a shrubby and grassy understorey (Haslem et al. 2012).
    ^p Within this broad vegetation type, three distinct classes occur; Triodia mallee,
    Chenopod/ Shrubby mallee and Heathy Mallee (White 2006; Haslem et al. 2012). This
    study took advantage of fire histories within Murray Sunset National Park (Avitabile
    et al. 2013) to conduct a chronosequence study of plant species growth over time
    (Falster & Westoby 2005a; Muir et al. 2014). Eleven areas varying in time-since-fire
    (1,2,4,8,13,15, 26, 33, 36,46,86 years), were selected within a relatively small
    region of Murray Sunset National Park, sites encompassed a range of post-fire
    ages whilst restricting the amount of edaphic variation, and all areas were within
    Triodia Mallee. Between three and five different patches within a 'time-since-fire'
    area were surveyed, totalling 50 surveys across 11 areas. Eighteen woody plant
    species were selected that had at least three individuals across each of the 50
    survey sites, a total of 1250 individual plants were sampled.

  methods: Guidance on sample sizes for measuring plant traits were followed from
    Cornelissen et al. (2003), and we took five samples (ie five leaves or five stem
    sections) from each of five individual plants for each species. Specific leaf
    area (SLA; mg mm2), the one-sided leaf surface area of fresh leaves divided by
    the mass of leaves oven-dried at 65 deg C for 48 h was measured for at least five
    leaves from each of five individuals for each species.

    sections) from each of five individual plants for each species. Stem tissue density
    (dry mass per unit fresh volume; mg mm3) was measured using 40-60 mm long, stem
    segments from at least five individuals per species. Samples were collected in
    the field and refrigerated before processing as soon as feasible. Stem tissue
    density was then determined following Archimedes principle using the protocol
    from Cornelissen et al. (2003).

    was measured for as many species as possible with field-collected seed, oven-dried
    and weighed. Seed mass data were also supplemented from the literature and a global
    seed mass database (Moles & Westoby 2003).

  methods: Guidance on sample sizes for measuring plant traits were followed from
    Cornelissen et al. (2003), and we took five samples (ie five leaves or five stem
    sections) from each of five individual plants for each species. Leaf nitrogen
    concentrations (Nmass; %) were calculated on five fully expanded leaves taken
    from well-lit positions on each of five individuals per species. Leaves from each
    species were then pooled and finely ground for nitrogen analysis. Total nitrogen
    concentration based on mass (%) was measured using complete combustion gas chromatography
    performed by The Surface and Chemical Analysis Network at The University of Melbourne.

- var_in: Ht

  replicates: various
  methods: We measured heights of at least five (and up to 10) individuals per species
    in each time-since-fire area. Many species in this region resprout after fire,
    but for species with postfire seed regeneration, separate measurements were made
    on seedling and resprouting individuals. It is easy to determine seeded individuals
    from resprouting individuals when plants are young, but as they age it becomes
    increasingly difficult to have confidence of whether an individual seeded or resprouted.
    Additionally, we thought it likely that resprouters would generally outpace reseeders
    due to their underground resource stores, and so modelling both functional types
    together might conflate growth rates based on functional traits and inherently
    different growth mechanisms (Falster & Westoby 2005a). Due to this, Eucalyptus
    oleosa, Eucalyptus gracilis and Melaleuca lanceolata (the resprouting species)
    were left out of the trait-based multispecies model, and their growth was modelled
    separately to represent the resprouting species.
