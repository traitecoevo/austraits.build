  description: gymnosperm dispersal data from Si-Chong Chen PhD
  collection_type: literature
  sample_age_class: adult_assumed
  sampling_strategy: Our study concerned vertebrates ingesting seeds, and the replicates
    were animal x plant interactions. Published data for vertebrate species and the
    seed species in their diet were located using the Institute for Scientific Information
    (ISI)Web of Knowledge (accessed in 2013) with the search terms '(f$ eces OR f$ ecal
    OR dung$ OR scat$ OR dropping$ OR defecat* OR ingest* OR endozoochor* OR 'gut
    content$' OR 'stomach content$ ' OR 'gizzard content$ ' OR diet OR 'food selection'
    OR 'food resource$ ' OR foraging OR frugivor* OR 'seed predat*') AND (seed$ OR
    fruit$ OR dispers*)'. We also searched for relevant papers in the reference lists
    of some focal papers. The plants in each animal's diet were recorded to species
    level where possible, but the unknown or undetermined plant species that had information
    about seed dimension in the original papers were also included. (This dataset
    is the gymnosperm data. The angiosperm data is separate.)
