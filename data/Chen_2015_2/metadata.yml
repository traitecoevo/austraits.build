  description: gymnosperm dispersal data from Si-Chong Chen PhD
  collection_type: Various
  sample_age_class: adult_assumed
  sites: worldwide data compilation
  sampling_strategy: Our study concerned vertebrates ingesting seeds, and the replicates were animal × plant interactions. Published data for vertebrate species and the seed species in their diet were located using the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI)Web of Knowledge (accessed in 2013) with the search terms ‘(f$eces OR f$ecal OR dung$ OR scat$ OR dropping$ OR defecat* OR ingest* OR endozoochor* OR “gut content$” OR “stomach content$” OR “gizzard content$” OR diet OR “food selection” OR “food resource$” OR foraging OR frugivor* OR “seed predat*”) AND (seed$ OR fruit$ OR dispers*)’. We also searched for relevant papers in the reference lists of some focal papers. The plants in each animal’s diet were recorded to species level where possible, but the unknown or undetermined plant species that had information about seed dimension in the original papers were also included. (This dataset is the gymnosperm data. The angiosperm data is separate.)
