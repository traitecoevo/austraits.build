  description: Hakea data from Western Australia from Byron Lamont
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: Ten sites with Hakea species in abundance were selected along
    two gradients totalling 1300 km in southwestern Australia (Fig. 1). All site floras
    were evergreen and all species analysed were shrubs growing in the open. Sites
    were chosen to represent the range of annual rainfall in each region. In Australia,
    the average rainfall and mean annual temperature of the nearest town for 1970-2000
    was determined from records provided by the Bureau of Meteorology, Perth. At each
    site, all species present in the selected taxa were sampled, ranging from four
    to 16, with a mean of 10. At most sites, the species sampled occurred over an
    area of 100 x 100 m, but in some flat areas (with negligible change in growing
    conditions) species were separated by up to 2 km. All sites were sampled in spring
    (September'November) from the previous season's growth, that is, all leaves had
    passed through one summer's drought. Flowering or fruiting branches were avoided,
    while only upper, sun-exposed branches were included.

  value_type: site_mean
  replicates: 5 plants, 2 to 4 subsamples per plant
  methods: All leaves were iso(bi)lateral and rarely possessed protruding midribs
    or petioles (which were excluded if they were prominent). Five to 20 branches
    from a total of five representative, mature plants per species were collected
    and placed in sealed plastic bags. Later that day, the thickness of the lamina
    at the longitudinal midpoint of one to two representative leaves per branch per
    plant were determined with vernier calipers. The transverse shape of needle leaves
    was noted for future correction to leaf volume (Lamont et al. 2015). Avoiding
    mottled or damaged leaves, all previous season's leaves were removed from their
    stems and bulked in equal proportions per plant. They were kept in rolled-up plastic
    bags for a further 1-2 days, then counted as they were placed diagonally on the
    conveyor belt (Li-Cor 3000, Lincoln, NK) of an area meter. They were then placed
    in paper bags and dried at 60-70 degC for 2 days. Area, mass and thickness were
    treated on an individual leaf basis. Leaf mass to area ratio (LMA) was determined,
    correcting for shape of the needle leaves (Witkowski & Lamont 1991, Lamont et
    al. 2015). Dry leaf density (dry mass per volume) was determined from LMA divided
    by thickness.

    Hakea leaves can vary from leptophylls to mesophylls so that their dimensions
    cover an exceptionally large range. The long tail is due to the leptophylls, then
    we have the needle leaves (nano-microphylls) then the broad leaves (micro-mesophylls)
    to give the bimodal curve. A unimodal curve should not be fitted to these data.
