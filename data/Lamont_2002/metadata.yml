  description: Hakea and Banksia data from Western Australia from Byron Lamont
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: Ten sites with Hakea species in abundance were selected along
    two gradients totalling 1300 km in southwestern Australia (Fig. 1). Fourteen sites
    with Proteaceae in abundance were selected along a less clearly defined gradient
    of 400 km in the western Cape of South Africa (Fig. 1). All site floras were evergreen
    and all species analysed were shrubs growing in the open. Sites were chosen to
    represent the range of annual rainfall in each region. In Australia, the average
    rainfall of the nearest town for 1985–94 was determined from records provided
    by the Bureau of Meteorology, Perth. At each site, all species present in the
    selected taxa were sampled, ranging from four to 16, with a mean of 10 in Australia.
    Species with very hairy leaves (two in all) were avoided as this was considered
    an alternative strategy to sclerophylly in conserving water. Where the sexes of
    dioecious species had distinctive foliage (some Leucadendron, Aulax) they were
    treated as separate species. At most sites, the species sampled occurred over
    an area of 100 x 100 m, but in some flat areas (with negligible change in growing
    conditions) species were separated by up to 2 km. All sites were sampled in spring
    (September–November) from the previous season's growth, that is, all leaves had
    passed through one summer's drought. Flowering or fruiting branches were avoided,
    while only upper, sun-exposed branches were included.

  trait_name: specific_leaf_area
  value_type: site_mean
  replicates: 5
  methods: All leaves were iso(bi)lateral and rarely possessed protruding midribs
    or petioles (which were excluded if they were prominent). Five to 20 branches
    from a total of five representative, mature plants per species were collected
    and placed in sealed plastic bags. Later that day, the thickness of the lamina
    at the longitudinal midpoint of one to two representative leaves per branch per
    plant were determined with vernier calipers. The transverse shape of needle leaves
    was noted for future correction of leaf volume. Avoiding mottled or damaged leaves,
    all previous season's leaves were removed from their stems and bulked in equal
    proportions per plant. They were kept in rolled-up plastic bags for a further
    1–2 days, then counted as they were placed diagonally on the conveyor belt (Li-Cor
    3000, Lincoln, NK) or image plate (DIAS II, Delta-T Devices, Cambridge, UK) of
    an area meter. They were then placed in paper bags and dried at 60–70 °C for 2
    days and bulked dry mass taken. However, area, mass and thickness for the hakea
    material were treated on an individual leaf basis. Leaf mass to area ratio (LMA)
    was determined, correcting for shape of the needle leaves (Witkowski & Lamont
    1991). Dry leaf density (dry mass per volume) was determined from LMA divided
    by thickness (Witkowski & Lamont 1991).
