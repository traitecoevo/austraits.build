  description: This study investigates the reproductive potential of 22 rare and threatened
    Western Australian taxa in the genus Verticordia (Myrtaceae) over a 5-year period.
  basis_of_record: lab
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: All Verticordia seeds used in this study were collected from
    wild populations between January 1994 and December 1998. Site names have been
    abbreviated due to the confidentiality of locational information for conservation
    flora. Seed stocks are held ex situ at the Department of Conservation and Land
    Management's Threatened Flora Seed Centre, a seed-based genebank for the conservation
    of genetic material from rare and threatened taxa. Seeds were tested for germinability
    freshly collected and, in many cases, after moisture content reduction and storage
    at -20 oC for periods of up to 5 years. Seed set was assessed by sectioning 3
    replicate samples of 100 old flowers (fruits) through the hypanthium to establish
    the presence or absence of a healthy seed (swollen, moist, white embryo). Calculation
    of seed set by the cut test method was based on the proportion of seeds to old
    flowers rather than the seed to ovule ratio. Seed to flower ratio was considered
    to be a more useful indicator of reproductive potential than seed to ovule ratio
    as rarely did more than 1 ovule per flower set. “Seed set” was therefore defined
    as the number of intact and healthy seeds for a given number of flowers. Some
    predation of developing ovules was observed during cut tests, although the level
    of predation was not quantified.

  replicates: Seeds used in germination trials
  methods: Seed germination trials were conducted under laboratory conditions. Seed
    sample sizes were dependent on the number of old flowers (fruits) collected, as
    well as the number of seeds obtained by the cut test (seed set) and ranged from
    5 to over 1000 seeds (x-61). To aid germination, seeds were completely excised
    from the old flowers with a scalpel under a dissecting microscope. Prior to seed
    coat removal, flowers were soaked in distilled water for a minimum of 2 hours
    to soften the seed coat. Seeds were germinated in 90 mm glass Petrie dishes on
    a 0.75% (w/v) agar solution in temperature and light controlled incubation cabinets,
    using a 12-hour photoperiod. Cabinets were set at a constant 15 0C. A 2% solution
    of Previcure fungicide was added to the agar solution to inhibit fungal growth.
    Seeds were not surface sterilised prior to incubation. Petrie dishes were checked
    twice weekly and germination was determined by radicle emergence. ^p Previous
    research (A Cochrane, unpublished data) has indicated that many species of Verticordia
    are smoke responsive, and the seeds of those species requiring aqueous smoke treatment
    for optimum germination were soaked for 24 hours in a smoke solution obtained
    from Perth's Kings Park and Botanic Gardens and produced according to Dixon et
    al. (1995). After soaking, seeds were rinsed with distilled water prior to incubation.
    Growth promoters have been found to be necessary to cue germination in fresh seed
    of Verticordia, and the growth hormone gibberellic acid (GA3) was added to the
    agar medium at either 25 mg L-1 or 10 mg L-1.
