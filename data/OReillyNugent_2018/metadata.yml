  description: "Joint-species distribution models (JSDMs) can potentially untangle
    the environmental and competitive drivers of community composition. Extending
    JSDMs to include abundance data would allow them to be used to answer questions
    of community composition and species dominance. We describe a modelling approach
    that incorporates abundance data within a JSDM framework to identify non-native
    species having strong competitive impacts."
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult_assumed
  sampling_strategy: We use data from an experiment that tested whether different
    management interventions (including grazing exclusion) can increase native grassland
    species richness (Driscoll, 2017). In 2010 ten sites were established along a
    fertility gradient (see below). Sites ranged from relatively uninvaded communities
    to communities dominated by non-native species. Each site contained 10 permanently
    marked 5 m x 5 m plots separated by at least 1 m. From 2011, a range of experimental
    treatments were applied (see Appendix 1) whereby half of the 10 plots at each
    site were fenced in a single enclosure to exclude large mammalian herbivores (predominantly
    kangaroos but also rabbits). One treatment involved annual biomass removal by
    slashing, both inside and outside the fenced enclosures. Our analysis focused
    on these fenced and grazed, slashed and unslashed plots (Fig. S2). This paired
    design meant that we could compare species responses in fenced versus grazed plots
    to assess whether the competitive impact of non-native species was moderated by
    herbivores, and compare the effect of grazing by herbivores to general biomass
    removal (i.e. by slashing).   Vegetation surveys were conducted every year from
    2010 to 2016, except for 2014. In late spring (October), the percent cover of
    all vascular plant species was visually estimated in four 1 m x 1 m quadrats,
    which were placed in the corners of each plot (only 3 quadrats per plot were surveyed
    in 2013 due to time constraints). Our dataset thus comprised 6 years of vegetation
    cover data from 160 quadrats across 40 plots. In total, we had 920 quadrat level
    vegetation measurements, comprising 10,780 cover estimates for 142 species (70
    native and 72 non-native; Fig. S3) (see Appendix S1 for more details).

 Pinnacle Reserve, ACT:
      description: The vegetation of the reserve comprised a scattered overstorey of trees, predominantly Eucalyptus blakelyi and E. melliodora, with a dense understorey of grasses and forbs. The vegetation has been extensively modified over the last 150 years, primarily by tree clearance and livestock grazing. Livestock grazing ceased in the reserve in 1993 and the dominant herbivore is now the native eastern grey kangaroo (Macropus giganteus), which occurs at moderately high density (1.8 – 2.2 ha-1; Driscoll 2017). The understorey vegetation comprises a mix of native and non-native species, with many species introduced for pasture improvement (e.g. Dactylis glomerata and Trifolium subterraneum) or as pasture contaminants (e.g. Avena fatua and Bromus diandrus).

  methods: In 2015 and 2016, we measured the traits of species that made up 80% of
    the cover at each site. At each site, we recorded traits associated with growth
    rate and light capture on 5-10 adult individuals in each of the unslashed plots
    following standard protocols (Harguindeguy et al. 2013), including canopy height
    (m), maximum height (m), canopy width (m), leaf length and width (cm) and specific
    leaf area (mm2 mg-1; SLA). We used 90th quantile values from all measured plants
    to estimate species maximum potential for each trait, avoiding the influence of
    outliers.
