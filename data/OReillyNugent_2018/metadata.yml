  description: Joint-species distribution models (JSDMs) can potentially untangle
    the environmental and competitive drivers of community composition. Extending
    JSDMs to include abundance data would allow them to be used to answer questions
    of community composition and species dominance. We describe a modelling approach
    that incorporates abundance data within a JSDM framework to identify non-native
    species having strong competitive impacts.

  sampling_strategy: We use data from an experiment that tested whether different
    management interventions (including grazing exclusion) can increase native grassland
    species richness (Driscoll, 2017). In 2010 ten sites were established along a
    fertility gradient (see below). Sites ranged from relatively uninvaded communities
    to communities dominated by non-native species. Each site contained 10 permanently
    marked 5 m x 5 m plots separated by at least 1 m. From 2011, a range of experimental
    treatments were applied (see Appendix 1) whereby half of the 10 plots at each
    site were fenced in a single enclosure to exclude large mammalian herbivores (predominantly
    kangaroos but also rabbits). One treatment involved annual biomass removal by
    slashing, both inside and outside the fenced enclosures. Our analysis focused
    on these fenced and grazed, slashed and unslashed plots (Fig. S2). Vegetation
    surveys were conducted every year from 2010 to 2016, except for 2014. In late
    spring (October), the percent cover of all vascular plant species was visually
    estimated in four 1 m x 1 m quadrats, which were placed in the corners of each
    plot (only 3 quadrats per plot were surveyed in 2013 due to time constraints).
    In 2015 and 2016, we measured the traits of species that made up 80% of cover
    at each site. At each site, we recorded traits associated with growth rate and
    light capture on 5-10 adult individuals in each of the unslashed plots following
    standard protocols (Perez-Harguindeguy et al. 2013)

  Pinnacle Reserve, ACT:
    description: The vegetation of the reserve comprised a scattered overstorey of
      trees, predominantly Eucalyptus blakelyi and E. melliodora, with a dense understorey
      of grasses and forbs. The vegetation has been extensively modified over the
      last 150 years, primarily by tree clearance and livestock grazing. Livestock
      grazing ceased in the reserve in 1993 and the dominant herbivore is now the
      native eastern grey kangaroo (Macropus giganteus), which occurs at moderately
      high density (1.8 - 2.2 ha-1; Driscoll 2017). The understorey vegetation comprises
      a mix of native and non-native species, with many species introduced for pasture
      improvement (e.g. Dactylis glomerata and Trifolium subterraneum) or as pasture
      contaminants (e.g. Avena fatua and Bromus diandrus).

    soil type: Soils are typically low fertility, shallow and rocky, although some
      deeper soils occur on slopes and in depressions.

  methods: 5 - 10 of the tallest mature individuals were measured by holding the plant
    upright and measuring the distance between the ground and the highest point on
    the canopy using a two-meter, metal ruler. This measurement ignored infloresences
    and other protrusions if the main stem exceeded the canopy.

  methods: 5 - 10 mature individuals were measured by holding a two-meter metal ruler
    level above the longest axis of the plant and recording furthest difference between
    two outer points on the canopy. A second measurement was taken on the orthogonal
    axis (forming a cross) and canopy width was calculated as the average of these
    two measurements.

  methods: 5 - 10 full expanded green leaves were collected of the tallest mature
    individuals in each plot. Leaves were placed into plastic zip-lock bags and kept
    in an ice-box to reduce water loss. Leaves, excluding petioles, were scanned within
    2 - 4 hrs of collection, then oven dried at 70 degrees C for 72 hrs and weighed.
    Total leaf area was extracted using ImageJ.
