  description: Measurements of leaf traits on plantation-grown trees to disentangle
    the effects of acclimation and adaption; seeds collected in locations with disparate
    rainfall and grown on a productive and unproductive site
  basis_of_record: field_experiment
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: Full details of the common-garden sites may be found in Duncan
    et al . (2000); Duncan (2001). The two common-garden sites were in south-eastern
    Australia, a region where water deficits are common in summer, but the frequency
    and severity of such deficits varies throughout the region. Site PPFD is unknown
    but is unlikely to vary given that the two sites are at very similar latitudes,
    and do not differ in aspect (both are approximately flat) or the number of cloudy
    days. Rainfall at the productive site, Mt Worth, was more than twice as great
    as at the unproductive site, Glencoe (Table 1). Availability of N and P at Mt
    Worth was also greater than at Glencoe (see also differences in Nmass , Table
    S1 in Supplementary material). Additional data on N availability are given by
    Warren (2006). Both common gardens were established in 1987 with the planting
    of 88 seed lots ('ecotypes') representing 33 Eucalyptus species. Ecotypes were
    planted in a complete block design as 12-tree plots (three rows spaced at 3.6
    m, four trees spaced at 2.8 m) with five replicate plots. Our primary interest
    was variation among species, thus our sampling was restricted to 35 ecotypes representing
    29 species (Table S1). Multiple ecotypes of E. obliqua , E. elata , E. viminalis
    and E. saligna were included in the sampling and analysis as they originated from
    geographically isolated places with disparate rainfall. Multiple ecotypes (of
    the same species) were considered independent because they were separated by hundreds
    of kilometres. The names of ecotypes and their assignment to subgenera follows
    Brooker's recent classification of Eucalyptus (Brooker 2000).

  methods: The inverse of the reported variable, fresh mass/dry mass. Fresh weight
    of each leaf was measured immediately after removal of leaves from plastic bags

    + LI-3050A, Li-Cor Inc., Lincoln, Nebraska). Leaf area was only recorded for leaves
    unaffected by herbivory. Dry mass was determined after leaves were dried for 72
    h in an oven at 60 deg C. The SLA was calculated as (one-sided) area divided by
    dry mass; 5 leaves measured per tree.

- var_in: '[Rubisco] (mg g-1)'

  trait_name: leaf_rubisco_per_leaf_dry_mass
  entity_type: population
  value_type: mean
  basis_of_value: measurement
  replicates: 3-5
  methods: Rubisco was quantified by capillary electrophoresis using a method modified
    from Warren et al. (2000a). Capillary electrophoresis was performed with a Beckman
    P/ACE MDQ system (Beckman-Coulter, Fullerton, CA, USA) fitted with a photodiode
    array detector and controlled by a computer running SYSTEM GOLD software (Beckman-Coulter).
    The separation of proteins was performed in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) 14-200
    gel buffer (Beckman-Coulter) in an SDS-coated fusedsilica capillary (100 um internal
    diameter x 31.2 cm long, eCap SDS 14-200 capillary, Beckman-Coulter). Standard
    curves for purified Rubisco were highly linear (r2 = 0.99) over the range of 0.05-1
    g l-1. Standard curves were also highly linear (r2 = 0.98 or better) when constructed
    by serial dilution of leaf extracts from E. globulus, E. obliqua or E. rubida.
    In addition, there was 95% recovery of Rubisco in spike and recovery tests with
    leaf extracts from E. globulus, E. obliqua and E. rubida. These findings indicate
    that quantification was unaffected by the complex matrix of Eucalyptus leaves
    (Warren et al. 2000b). The fraction of N present as Rubisco was calculated assuming
    that Rubisco is 16.7% N by weight.
