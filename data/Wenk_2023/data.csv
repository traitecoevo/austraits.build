Terminalia prostrata,Combretaceae,APC_accepted,binomial,"species - floras; Barrett 2015, Australian Systematic Botany 28: 23–45",Barrett_2015,2015,"The status of this taxon has been a matter of some confusion and it is currently included under T. ferdinandiana Exell on the Australian Plant Census, although still recognised by BRI (Bostock and Holland 2013). It was described by Pedley (1990) as having a disjunct distribution on Cape York Peninsula, northern Queensland, and in the ‘top end’ of the NT. In northern Queensland, the taxon is only known as a prostrate or low-growing shrub. In the NT, the decumbent or low-growing shrubs are considered to represent resprouting forms of the large tree species T. ferdinandiana (I.Cowie, pers. comm.). These forms have had the main stems burnt off by fire, and the resprouting stems have the ability to flower and fruit at a young age; hence, they appear to be small shrubs such as T. prostrata. Dunlop et al. (1995) did not distinguish T. prostrata from T. ferdinandiana, although it was recognised in the NT by Puruntatameri et al. (2001). Precocious flowering and fruiting has also been observed in T. ferdinandiana in the Kimberley region following fire (R. L. Barrett, pers. obs.). Other species in the region such as Atalaya brevialata Cowie & G.M.Wightman and Planchonia careya (F.Muell.) R.Knuth also flower precociously when affected by fire in this manner (Barrett 2006; Cowie and Stuckey 2012).",shrub,woody,resprouts after fire,resprouts,,NT,,,,,,,

Androecium of usually 57–70 stamens but up to 78 recorded, with 10–15(18) stamens per fascicle; fascicles c. 1 mm wide at base, the filaments connate for half or more of their length and up to 2 mm long. Anthers c. 0.2 mm long, c. 0.4 mm wide. Ovary 3-locular; placenta broadly elliptic with marginal small circular attachment points for the ovules, flat, very broadly attached by an oval hollow structure; ovules 12–16 per loculus. Style 1.4–1.8 mm long, base separated by 0.4–0.5 mm from the placentas; stigma c. 0.3 mm diam. Fruit 2/3–3/4 inferior, c. 2.5 mm long, c. 2.5 mm diam.; hypanthium cup-shaped; disc flat around the margin, somewhat raised in centre into 3 valves, conspicuously dotted with minute white oil glands; placentas elliptic with acute ends, c. 0.7 mm long, c. 0.35 mm wide, c. 0.15 mm thick. Seeds laterally compressed, 0.8–0.9 mm long, c. 0.35 mm wide, 0.6–0.7 mm deep, the basal and distal inner facets roughly equal and the hilum above the middle of the basal inner facet, with a large modified region on the inner surface that is more or less triangular from side view and has narrowly oblong cells; testa pale yellowish brown, with longitudinal rows of many transversely oblong cells. Chaff pieces probably numerous, similar in appearance to seeds except that they tend to be only c. 0.2 mm wide, with the crustaceous wall similar to or thicker than that of the seeds. Distribution and habitat. Endemic to the Limmen Bight region of Northern Territory, recorded from near Limmen Gate on Bohemia Downs Station. Astartea intratropica grows in cracks on sandstone blocks and has recently been recorded as the dominant species in this restricted habitat. Mueller (1859) described the habitat as wet rocky slopes and around springs and Bentham (1867: 91) described it as ‘ravines of the sandstone table-land’. Phenology. Flowers and fruits recorded from late August to mid-September. Seorsus intratropicus is probably not lignotuberous, but its rocky habitat presumably gives it significant protection from fires",shrub,woody,occurs in fire-protected rocky habitats,,,,,fire_avoidance_among_rocks,,,,,
Thryptomene dampieri,Myrtaceae,APC_accepted,binomial,"species - Rye 2014, Nuytsia 24: 269–306",Rye_2014,2014,"Shrub usually low and spreading, often rooting adventitiously from prostrate or sprawling stems, 0.2–0.7(–1) m high, up to 1.5 m wide; flowering branchlets with 2–8 pairs of flowers usually in a dense cluster. Leaves mostly crowded and widely antrorse. Petioles 0.2–0.5 mm long. Leaf blades often somewhat recurved towards apex (but with keel apex incurved), mostly broadly obovate to depressed-obovate and 1.3–3 mm long, 1.5–2.2 mm wide, broadly obtuse, usually entire but sometimes minutely denticulate; abaxial surface convex, with 3 or 4(5) main rows of oil glands on each side of midvein and 3–5 glands < 0.1 mm diam. in each of the two central rows, rarely with only 1 or 2 rows of glands obvious; adaxial surface concave. Peduncles 1-flowered, 0.2–0.8 mm long. Bracteoles persistent after fruit shed, with the keel green and leaf-like, with broad scarious margins below the thick green apical point, broadly ovate, 0.6–1.6 mm long, denticulate on the scarious margins or entire. Pedicels ± absent. Flower buds with a concave or flat apex. Flowers 4–6 mm diam. Hypanthium with many fine irregular longitudinal wrinkles or similar irregular patterning. Sepals fairly erect in flower, tightly closed inwards in fruit, very broadly ovate or depressed-ovate, 0.5–0.9 mm long, 1–1.4 mm wide, pale pink, minutely denticulate or sometimes entire, often distinctly auriculate. Petals erect at base and widely spreading above in flower, loosely closed inwards in fruit, usually broadly obovate, 1.5–2 mm long, pink or pink-purple, ± entire. Stamens usually 10, alternating between the sepals and petals, ± equidistant. Filaments 0.4–0.8 mm long. Anthers c. 0.3 mm wide. Style 0.5–0.8 mm long. Fertile fruits depressed-obovoid, c. 1.4 mm long, c. 1.8 mm diam.; hypanthium developing a pattern of irregular longitudinal furrows; seed transversely reniform, 1.1–1.2 mm high, 1.4–1.5 mm across. Distribution and habitat. Extends from the Exmouth area south along the west coast to the Hamelin Bay area, occurring off-shore on Dorre and Dirk Hartog Islands (Figure 4). Occurs on sand dunes and limestone, for example on white beaches or on red sand overlying limestone, often in low heath including spinifex or in taller Acacia shrubland, also recorded in salty brownish sand. Phenology. Flowers from April to September. Fruits from August to October. Notes. This species is recorded as regenerating successfully from underground parts after fires. The bracteoles have a leafy keel and broad membranous sides, the apex usually prominent and leaf-like. The hypanthium is rugose, usually with numerous irregular wrinkles and grooves.",shrub,woody,resprouts from underground after fire,resprouts,,,,,underground_buds,,,,
