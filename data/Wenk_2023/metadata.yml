  description: A curated collection of life history values that includes nearly
    all species in the Australian Plant Census (APC). 
  basis_of_record: literature, field
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: This dataset is compiled from a combination of data extracted from state and national online floras, supplemented by the taxonomic literature. Information in the state and national floras was scraped using natural language processing and is individually stored in AusTraits under the dataset_ids ABRS_2022 (Flora of Australia), NHNSW_2022, NTH_2022, RBGV_2022, SAH_2022, WAH_2022_1, and WAH_2022_2. If all floras offered the same trait value for all taxa and that value was either 'annual' or 'perennial', this was automatically accepted. For all entries where different state floras provided different life history values or values that indicated a 'mixed score' (e.g. 'annual biennial'), the descriptions in the floras were individually read and a concensus score was assigned. For entries without a value in any of the floras, additional sources were refereced including the print Flora of Australia books, the taxonomic literature, floras from others countries (especially for naturalised species), and other reliable websites. The source for each score is documented in the columns 'source' and 'citation'. In addition, the column 'scoring' indicates if a score was based on the species, genus, or family descriptions; for some taxa the entire genus or family has the same life history score and then this value was used for all species lacking an individual score.
