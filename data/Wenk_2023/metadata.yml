  description: A curated collection of life history values that includes nearly all
    species in the Australian Plant Census (APC).
  basis_of_record: literature, field
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: This dataset is compiled from a combination of data extracted
    from state and national online floras, supplemented by the taxonomic literature.
    Information in the state and national floras was scraped using natural language
    processing and is individually stored in AusTraits under the dataset_ids ABRS_2022
    (Flora of Australia), NHNSW_2022, NTH_2022, RBGV_2022, SAH_2022, WAH_2022_1, and
    WAH_2022_2. If all floras offered the same trait value for all taxa and that value
    was either 'annual' or 'perennial', this was automatically accepted. For all entries
    where different state floras provided different life history values or values
    that indicated a 'mixed score' (e.g. 'annual biennial'), the descriptions in the
    floras were individually read and a concensus score was assigned. For entries
    without a value in any of the floras, additional sources were refereced including
    the print Flora of Australia books, the taxonomic literature, floras from others
    countries (especially for naturalised species), and other reliable websites. The
    source for each score is documented in the columns 'source' and 'citation'. In
    addition, the column 'scoring' indicates if a score was based on the species,
    genus, or family descriptions; for some taxa the entire genus or family has the
    same life history score and then this value was used for all species lacking an
    individual score.
