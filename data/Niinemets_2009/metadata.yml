  description: mesophyll conductance dataset from Niinemets and Wright for sclerophylls
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: A gradient of decreasing rainfall extends inland from the coast
    in this region. The two higher rainfall sites in Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park
    receive annually ~1.5-fold, and during the driest period between August and October
    ~1.8-fold, more precipitation than the two sites, located ~50 km west of Sydney
    in the Cumberland Plain (Castlereagh Nature Reserve and Agnes Banks Nature Reserve;
    Table 1). In both wetter and drier site pairs, the community on clay-rich soil
    had higher soil nutrient availabilities than that occurring on deep sands (Table
    1), with the drier/lower nutrient availability site (Agnes Banks) representing
    the extreme lowest values in soil nutrients, and the wetter/high nutrient site
    (West Head) the highest values (Table 1). At higher rainfall, the more fertile
    site supported closed forest with a rich understorey of ferns, cycads, shrubs,
    climbers, and herbs, while open woodland with species-rich heathy understorey
    occurs on the less fertile sand. The lower rainfall sites both supported open
    woodlands, with significant fractions of bare ground. A more detailed description
    of Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park sites is provided in Wright et al. (2001),
    while the drier sites are described in Benson (1992) and in NSW National Parks
    and Wildlife Service (1999). The overall aim in species selection was to obtain
    a broad, representative range of foliage architectures, longevities, and photosynthetic
    potentials across the sites. In addition, in each site, species with contrasting
    leaf structure and life span were selected to characterize site-specific variation
    and site effects on average foliage traits. As the major constraint in species
    selection, only broad-leaved species suitable for gas-exchange measurements with
    clip-on gas-exchange cuvettes were sampled. [See Rodeghiero et al. (2007) for
    extensive discussion of problems in gas-exchange measurements in leaves that do
    not entirely fill the small cuvette window or that result in extensive air passage
    between the cuvette gaskets.] At the more speciose, higher rainfall sites, 10
    species were sampled at the more fertile site and 13 species at the less fertile
    site. Six species were sampled at the more fertile low rainfall site, and three
    from the low nutrient site. To expand the overall variation range in foliage traits,
    naturally established individuals of three species (Pittosporum undulatum, Polyscias
    sambucifolia, and Acacia longifolia) and planted individuals of three other species
    (Banksia integrifolia, Banksia robur, and Macadamia ternifolia) were sampled in
    the forest and parklands of the Macquarie University campus, North Ryde, Sydney
    (33°46'S, 151°06' E). The campus environment with annual average precipitation
    of 1132 mm, annual average maximum temperature of 22.8°C and minimum temperature
    of 11.2°C, and high nutrient availability most closely resembles the wetter/high
    nutrient availability site (Table 1). Neither foliage N (P >0.13) nor foliage
    P (P >0.5) contents per mass differed between campus and wetter/high nutrient
    site according to analysis of variance (ANOVA). Altogether 35 species were studied
    across all sites (see Appendix I for the species list with key foliage traits).
    Two of the studied species are gymnosperms (cycads - Macrozamia communis and M.
    spiralis); all others are angiosperms. Six species (Acacia falcata, A. longifolia,
    A. myrtifolia, A. suaveolens, Macrozamia communis, and M. spiralis) are nitrogen
    fixers.

  methods: 'Twig sampling and conditioning for gas-exchange measurements was conducted
    as detailed in Niinemets et al. (2005a). Exposed twigs of mature individuals were
    sampled in all cases in the morning hours when ambient air water vapour pressure
    was low. The selected twigs were cut under water, and again immediately recut
    under water. The cut end was maintained in water and the twigs were transported
    to the laboratory within an hour from the collection. In the laboratory, the twigs
    in water were covered with plastic bags to reduce transpiration, and pre-conditioned
    at room temperature of 22 _C and at dim light of 50–100 lmol m_2 s_1 for 1–2 d
    before the gas-exchange measurements to stabilize stomatal conductance and reduce
    site-to-site and species-to-species differences in stomatal openness (Niinemets
    et al., 2005a). At each site, 2–4 different plants of a given species were sampled,
    and on average (6SD) 2.5160.82 individuals per species were investigated (altogether
    88 combined gasexchange/ fluorescence measurements). Gas-exchange and chlorophyll
    fluorescence Measurements: A Li-Cor LI-6400 portable photosynthesis system with
    a LI-6400-40 Leaf Chamber Fluorometer (Li-Cor, Inc., Lincoln, NE, USA) was employed
    to measure net assimilation rate (A) versus internal (CO2 concentration in substomatal
    cavities, Ci) CO2 response curves simultaneously with the effective quantum yields
    of photosystem II following the protocol of Niinemets et al. (2005a). A saturating
    quantum flux density of 1000 lmol m_2 s_1 (20% blue LED, 80% red LED) provided
    by the leaf chamber fluorometer was used. Leaf temperature was maintained at 25
    deg C, and a leaf to air water vapour pressure deficit was kept <1.1 kPa. Fully
    mature current-season leaves were used in all cases. Whenever a single leaf did
    not fully fill up the window of the gas-exchange cuvette, several leaves arranged
    side by side were enclosed in the cuvette.'

    in C*, Rd, and A (Harley et al., 1992; Niinemets et al., 2006). Chloroplastic
    CO2 concentrations (CC) for any given A were further calculated as CC¼Ci–A/gm,
    and the parameters of the photosynthesis model of Farquhar et al. (1980), the
    maximum carboxylase activity of Rubisco (Vcmax), and the capacity for photosynthetic
    electron transport (Jmax) were calculated as in Niinemets et al. (1999). In Vcmax

  methods: 'A low CO2 of 50 lmol mol_1 during the leaf stabilization period was used
    to ensure maximum stomatal openness before the measurement of A/Ci curves (Centritto
    et al., 2003). At this ambient CO2 concentration, maximum stomatal conductance
    was achieved 20 min to 2 h after leaf enclosure in the cuvette. After reaching
    the maximum stomatal conductance, steady-state values of net assimilation rates
    were measured at eight ambient CO2 concentrations between 50 lmol mol-1 and 2000
    lmol mol-1. When the steady-state assimilation rate at a given CO2 concentration,
    ;5 min after change in CO2 concentration, had been recorded, the steady-state
    chlorophyll fluorescence yield in the light-adapted state, F, was estimated, and
    a single saturating pulse of white light of 6800–7000 lmol m-2 s-1 was applied

    UPSII, was calculated as (Fm''–F)/Fm''. Upon completion of the A/Ci curve, the
    light was switched off, and as soon as the chamber temperature and ambient CO2
    concentrations had stabilized, commonly 1–2 min after leaf darkening, the dark
    respiration rate was recorded. '

  methods: 'A low CO2 of 50 lmol mol_1 during the leaf stabilization period was used
    to ensure maximum stomatal openness before the measurement of A/Ci curves (Centritto
    et al., 2003). At this ambient CO2 concentration, maximum stomatal conductance
    was achieved 20 min to 2 h after leaf enclosure in the cuvette. After reaching
    the maximum stomatal conductance, steady-state values of net assimilation rates
    were measured at eight ambient CO2 concentrations between 50 lmol mol-1 and 2000
    lmol mol-1. When the steady-state assimilation rate at a given CO2 concentration,
    ;5 min after change in CO2 concentration, had been recorded, the steady-state
    chlorophyll fluorescence yield in the light-adapted state, F, was estimated, and
    a single saturating pulse of white light of 6800–7000 lmol m-2 s-1 was applied
    to close all photosystem II centres and obtain the maximum fluorescence yield
    Fm''. From these measurements, the effective quantum yield of photosystem II,

    chlorophyll fluorescence measurements (JETR), leaf reflectance and transmittance
    were estimated with a Li-Cor portable spectroradiometer (Li-Cor 1800, Li-Cor,
    Inc.) equipped with a Taylor-type integrated sphere. These measurements along
    with the blue and red LED spectra of the LI-6400-40 Leaf Chamber Fluorometer light
    source (Li-Cor Inc., 2004) were used to estimate the amount of light absorbed,
    Qabs. JETR was then determined (Schreiber et al., 1994; equation in cited manuscript).
