  description: mesophyll conductance dataset from Niinemets and Wright for sclerophylls
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: A gradient of decreasing rainfall extends inland from the coast
    in this region. The two higher rainfall sites in Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park
    receive annually ~1.5-fold, and during the driest period between August and October
    ~1.8-fold, less precipitation than the two sites, located ~50 km west of Sydney
    in the Cumberland Plain (Castlereagh Nature Reserve and Agnes Banks Nature Reserve;
    Table 1). In both wetter and drier site pairs, the community on clay-rich soil
    had higher soil nutrient availabilities than that occurring on deep sands (Table
    1), with the drier/lower nutrient availability site (Agnes Banks) representing
    the extreme lowest values in soil nutrients, and the wetter/high nutrient site
    (West Head) the highest values (Table 1). At higher rainfall, the more fertile
    site supported closed forest with a rich understorey of ferns, cycads, shrubs,
    climbers, and herbs, while open woodland with species-rich heathy understorey
    occurs on the less fertile sand. The lower rainfall sites both supported open
    woodlands, with significant fractions of bare ground. A more detailed description
    of Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park sites is provided in Wright et al. (2001),
    while the drier sites are described in Benson (1992) and in NSW National Parks
    and Wildlife Service (1999). The overall aim in species selection was to obtain
    a broad, representative range of foliage architectures, longevities, and photosynthetic
    potentials across the sites. In addition, in each site, species with contrasting
    leaf structure and life span were selected to characterize site-specific variation
    and site effects on average foliage traits. As the major constraint in species
    selection, only broad-leaved species suitable for gas-exchange measurements with
    clip-on gas-exchange cuvettes were sampled. [See Rodeghiero et al. (2007) for
    extensive discussion of problems in gas-exchange measurements in leaves that do
    not entirely fill the small cuvette window or that result in extensive air passage
    between the cuvette gaskets.] At the more speciose, higher rainfall sites, 10
    species were sampled at the more fertile site and 13 species at the less fertile
    site. Six species were sampled at the more fertile low rainfall site, and three
    from the low nutrient site. To expand the overall variation range in foliage traits,
    naturally established individuals of three species (Pittosporum undulatum, Polyscias
    sambucifolia, and Acacia longifolia) and planted individuals of three other species
    (Banksia integrifolia, Banksia robur, and Macadamia ternifolia) were sampled in
    the forest and parklands of the Macquarie University campus, North Ryde, Sydney
    (33°46'S, 151°06' E). The campus environment with annual average precipitation
    of 1132 mm, annual average maximum temperature of 22.8°C and minimum temperature
    of 11.2°C, and high nutrient availability most closely resembles the wetter/high
    nutrient availability site (Table 1). Neither foliage N (P >0.13) nor foliage
    P (P >0.5) contents per mass differed between campus and wetter/high nutrient
    site according to analysis of variance (ANOVA). Altogether 35 species were studied
    across all sites (see Appendix I for the species list with key foliage traits).
    Two of the studied species are gymnosperms (cycads - Macrozamia communis and M.
    spiralis); all others are angiosperms. Six species (Acacia falcata, A. longifolia,
    A. myrtifolia, A. suaveolens, Macrozamia communis, and M. spiralis) are nitrogen
    fixers.

  methods: "Twig sampling and conditioning for gas-exchange measurements was conducted as detailed in Niinemets et al. (2005a). Exposed twigs of mature individuals were sampled in all cases in the morning hours when ambient air water vapour pressure was low. The selected twigs were cut under water, and again immediately recut under water. The cut end was maintained in water and the twigs were transported to the laboratory within an hour from the collection. In the laboratory, the twigs in water were covered with plastic bags to reduce transpiration, and pre-conditioned at room temperature of 22 _C and at dim light of 50–100 lmol m_2 s_1 for 1–2 d before the gas-exchange measurements to stabilize stomatal conductance and reduce site-to-site and species-to-species differences in stomatal openness (Niinemets et al., 2005a). At each site, 2–4 different plants of a given species were sampled, and on average (6SD) 2.5160.82 individuals per species were investigated (altogether 88 combined gasexchange/ fluorescence measurements). Gas-exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence Measurements: A Li-Cor LI-6400 portable photosynthesis system with a LI-6400-40 Leaf Chamber Fluorometer (Li-Cor, Inc., Lincoln, NE, USA) was employed to measure net assimilation rate (A) versus internal (CO2 concentration in substomatal cavities, Ci) CO2 response curves simultaneously with the effective quantum yields of photosystem II following the protocol of Niinemets et al. (2005a). A saturating quantum flux density of 1000 lmol m_2 s_1 (20% blue LED, 80% red LED) provided by the leaf chamber fluorometer was used. Leaf temperature was maintained at 25 deg C, and a leaf to air water vapour pressure deficit was kept <1.1 kPa. Fully mature current-season leaves were used in all cases. Whenever a single leaf did not fully fill up the window of the gas-exchange cuvette, several leaves arranged side by side were enclosed in the cuvette."

  methods: "A low CO2 of 50 lmol mol_1 during the leaf stabilization period was used to ensure maximum stomatal openness before the measurement of A/Ci curves (Centritto et al., 2003). At this ambient CO2 concentration, maximum stomatal conductance was achieved 20 min to 2 h after leaf enclosure in the cuvette. After reaching the maximum stomatal conductance, steady-state values of net assimilation rates were measured at eight ambient CO2 concentrations between 50 lmol mol-1 and 2000 lmol mol-1. When the steady-state assimilation rate at a given CO2 concentration, ;5 min after change in CO2 concentration, had been recorded, the steady-state chlorophyll fluorescence yield in the light-adapted state, F, was estimated, and a single saturating pulse of white light of 6800–7000 lmol m-2 s-1 was applied to close all photosystem II centres and obtain the maximum fluorescence yield Fm'. From these measurements, the effective quantum yield of photosystem II, UPSII, was calculated as (Fm'–F)/Fm'. Upon completion of the A/Ci curve, the light was switched off, and as soon as the chamber temperature and ambient CO2 concentrations had stabilized, commonly 1–2 min after leaf darkening, the dark respiration rate was recorded.

To determine the rates of photosynthetic electron transport from chlorophyll fluorescence measurements (JETR), leaf reflectance and transmittance were estimated with a Li-Cor portable spectroradiometer (Li-Cor 1800, Li-Cor, Inc.) equipped with a Taylor-type integrated sphere. These measurements along with the blue and red LED spectra of the LI-6400-40 Leaf Chamber Fluorometer light source (Li-Cor Inc., 2004) were used to estimate the amount of light absorbed, Qabs. JETR was then determined (Schreiber et al., 1994; equation in cited manuscript).

  methods: A low CO2 of 50 lmol mol_1 during the leaf stabilization period was used to ensure maximum stomatal openness before the measurement of A/Ci curves (Centritto et al., 2003). At this ambient CO2 concentration, maximum stomatal conductance was achieved 20 min to 2 h after leaf enclosure in the cuvette. After reaching the maximum stomatal conductance, steady-state values of net assimilation rates were measured at eight ambient CO2 concentrations between 50 lmol mol-1 and 2000 lmol mol-1. When the steady-state assimilation rate at a given CO2 concentration, ;5 min after change in CO2 concentration, had been recorded, the steady-state chlorophyll fluorescence yield in the light-adapted state, F, was estimated, and a single saturating pulse of white light of 6800–7000 lmol m-2 s-1 was applied to close all photosystem II centres and obtain the maximum fluorescence yield Fm'. From these measurements, the effective quantum yield of photosystem II, UPSII, was calculated as (Fm'–F)/Fm'.

questions:
  contributor: I still need to add in leaf thickness (missed it as I merged files), Are there any other variables in the files 'datafile-ian...' that I should particularly include? Maybe PNUE (a trait in AusTraits)
  question2: I'm not sure what the abbreviation "TPU" stands for.
  question3: Is the variable fv/fm represented somewhere in the fluorescence data under a different name - it is reported in other studies we've received. (but on branches so they don't show up)
  additional_traits: Additional traits include more fluorescence variables, rflectance data, and carotenoid content.
