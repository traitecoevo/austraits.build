  description: A comparison of stem hydraulic conductivity and vascular anatomy between
    eight C3 and eight C4 herbaceous species.
  basis_of_record: experiment
  life_stage: saplings
  sampling_strategy: All plants were grown from seeds for three months in 6 L pots
    on an outdoor roof at the University of Toronto, Ontario. The potting medium was
    a mix of 25% Promix (Sun Gro Horticulture Canada Ltd, Seba Beach, AB, Canada),
    25% sand and 50% topsoil. The plants were watered regularly to avoid drought and
    were fertilized once a week with a full-strength Hoagland's solution. Plants were
    measured approximately 3 months after germination.

  methods: Xylem area and conduit diameters were measured on stem cross-sections obtained
    from the same samples as used for hydraulic conductivity measurements. For each  pecies,
    six of the stem segments that had previously been used for Kh determination were
    fixed with formalin, acetic acid and ethyl alchohol in water (FAA), paraffin-embedded
    and sectioned using a sliding microtome. Sections were examined under a light
    microscope and images analysed with imaging software (Image Pro Plus; Carsen Group
    Inc., Markham, Ontario, Canada). The lengths of major and minor axes across a
    conduit were averaged to obtain vessel diameters. Maximum vessel diameter (MVD)
    was measured from each cross-section on the largest vessel. The vessels mean diameter
    (VMD), hydraulically weighted mean diameter (HMD), mean diameter of conduits that
    facilitate 95% of the flow (D95) and vessel frequency (VF, the number of vessels
    per xylem area) were determined for each segment by measuring all xylem conduits
    in three randomly chosen sectors from the cambium to pith that together represented
    at least 20% of the stem xylem area. The hydraulically weighted mean diameter
    (HMD) was calculated as D = 2(sumr5/sumr4), where r is the radius of a conduit
    (Sperry et al. 1994). Conduit efficiency value was determined by dividing the
    sum of the fourth power of all conduits extrapolated to whole xylem area by the
    leaf area supplied by these conduits. Conduit efficiency is important because
    it indexes the contribution of xylem anatomy to the hydraulic supply of the canopy.
    Porosity of the xylem was also indexed to the leaf area to produce leaf specific
    porosity (LSP), which is calculated as the total vessel lumen area divided by
    the leaf area.
