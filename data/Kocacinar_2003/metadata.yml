  description: A comparison of stem hydraulic conductivity and vascular anatomy between
    eight C3 and eight C4 herbaceous species.
  basis_of_record: lab
  life_stage: saplings
  sampling_strategy: All plants were grown from seeds for three months in 6 L pots
    on an outdoor roof at the University of Toronto, Ontario. The potting medium was
    a mix of 25% Promix (Sun Gro Horticulture Canada Ltd, Seba Beach, AB, Canada),
    25% sand and 50% topsoil. The plants were watered regularly to avoid drought and
    were fertilized once a week with a full-strength Hoagland's solution. Plants were
    measured approximately 3 months after germination.

  methods: Xylem area and conduit diameters were measured on stem cross-sections obtained
    from the same samples as used for hydraulic conductivity measurements. For each
    species, six of the stem segments that had previously been used for Kh determination
    were fixed with formalin, acetic acid and ethyl alchohol in water (FAA), paraffin-embedded
    and sectioned using a sliding microtome. Sections were examined under a light
    microscope and images analysed with imaging software (Image Pro Plus; Carsen Group
    Inc., Markham, Ontario, Canada). The lengths of major and minor axes across a
    conduit were averaged to obtain vessel diameters. Maximum vessel diameter (MVD)
    was measured from each cross-section on the largest vessel. The vessels mean diameter
    (VMD), hydraulically weighted mean diameter (HMD), mean diameter of conduits that
    facilitate 95% of the flow (D95) and vessel frequency (VF, the number of vessels
    per xylem area) were determined for each segment by measuring all xylem conduits
    in three randomly chosen sectors from the cambium to pith that together represented
    at least 20% of the stem xylem area.

    at least 20% of the stem xylem area. The hydraulically weighted mean diameter
    (HMD) was calculated as D = 2(sumr5/sumr4), where r is the radius of a conduit
    (Sperry et al. 1994). Conduit efficiency value was determined by dividing the
    sum of the fourth power of all conduits extrapolated to whole xylem area by the
    leaf area supplied by these conduits. Conduit efficiency is important because
    it indexes the contribution of xylem anatomy to the hydraulic supply of the canopy.
    Porosity of the xylem was also indexed to the leaf area to produce leaf specific
    porosity (LSP), which is calculated as the total vessel lumen area divided by
    the leaf area.

  methods: Stem hydraulic conductivity (Kh) was measured on 5-10 main stems of each
    species using segments 0.3-1 cm in diameter and 5-10 cm in length. Only the lower
    portion of the main stem was measured in order to maximize xylem content and minimize
    pith tissue. Stem segments of 5-10 cm were used for all measurements after preliminary
    assessments showed no change in Kh on stem segments ranging in length from 5 to
    15 cm. Segments were first cut under water, and then flushed with a perfusion
    solution at elevated pressure (150-175 kPa) to remove embolisms (Sperry, Donnelly
    & Tyree 1988). The perfusion solution was deionized, degassed and filtered (0.2
    µm) water. Agents such as KCl or oxalic acid were not used because the measurements
    lasted less than 30 min and new solution was used every 3 d; hence microbial growth
    was negligible. After perfusion, the volumetric flow rate through the segments
    was measured at 5-20 kPa. A pressure-flow plot was constructed for each segment
    and Kh was calculated from the slope of the plot multiplied by stem length (Dryden
    & Van Alfen 1983). Linearity was high in each case as indicated by r2 values between
    0.98 and 0.9999 for the linear regression equations. Xylem specific conductivity
    (Ks) was calculated by dividing Kh by xylem cross-sectional area determined with
    a light microscope (Olympus AX70, Olympus America Inc., Melville, New York, USA).
    Lumen specific conductivity (Kls) was obtained by dividing Kh by total vessel
    lumen area as determined by measuring the cross-sectional area of all the vessels
    in representative sectors of the xylem and extrapolating it to the whole xylem
    in a stem. Kls is more informative than Ks alone because Kls takes xylem porosity
    and vessel frequency into account. Leaf specific conductivity (KL) was measured
    as Kh divided by the leaf area distal to the segment. Leaf area was measured using
    a Li-Cor 3100 leaf area meter (Li-Cor, Lincoln, NB, USA).
