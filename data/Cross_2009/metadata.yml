  description: Erika Cross Woodlands of western Victoria trait data
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: The traits were collected from across a number of grassy Red
    Gum woodlands in western Vicroria (between Balmoral, Coleraine and Harrow). Plant
    trait measurements were made following the protocol outlined in Cornelisson et
    al. (2003). Plant material was collected from ten well-grown, robust, mature individuals
    growing in full sun positions. Specimens were excavated from soil with sufficient
    root material to allow an accurate assessment of root lateral spread. To avoid
    desiccation, plants were transported in sealed plastic bags until rehydration
    was possible. Rehydration involved submerging root material into water overnight
    (approximately 8-12 hours) in a cool, dark room.
  original_file: relevent data from the file "2014  updated plant functional trait
    database.xls" extracted. Original copy of the excel file located in Google Drive
    in the folder "Morgan_2011_1 Morgan_2011_2 Morgan_2014 Angevin_2010 Briggs_2010
    Cross_2011 Lunt_2012 Roberts_2006 Scott_2010"
  notes: Flowering period and flowering start times were derived from herbarium records
    (Royal Botanic Gardens Board, Melbourne, MELISR database, 20 January 2009). Only
    Victorian records in close proximity to the study region from an altitude less
    than 400 m a.s.l. were used. (But this data isn't in AusTraits)

- var_in: SLA (mg/mm2)
  unit_in: mm2/mg
  trait_name: specific_leaf_area
  value_type: site_mean
  replicates: 10
  methods: To obtain specific leaf area (SLA) leaf wet mass was recorded for rehydrated  leaves
    using an analytical weighing balance; leaves were then scanned using a 1200 dpi  flatbed
    scanner and leaf area measurement software. Leaves were then dried at 80oC for
    approximately 72 hours and allowed to cool in a desiccating cabinet before leaf
    dry weight was recorded using the same weighing balance as leaf wet mass. SLA
    was obtained by dividing leaf area by leaf dry mass. Leaf dry matter content was
    obtained by dividing leaf dry mass by leaf wet mass multiplied by 100. The largest
    leaves of each individual were used to measure the above mentioned traits. Damaged,
    senescent and generally unhealthy leaves were avoided.
