  description: In this study, we measured vulnerability to drought-induced cavitation
    in woody roots and stems of five tree species (Acacia aneura, Cedrus deodara,
    Eucalyptus crebra, Eucalytus saligna, and Quercus palustris) with a wide range
    of xylem anatomies. X-ray microtomography was used to visualize the accumulation
    of xylem embolism in stems and roots of intact plants that were naturally dehydrated
    to varying levels of water stress.
  basis_of_record: lab
  life_stage: sapling
  sampling_strategy: Plant material was sourced from a local Sydney nursery and grown
    in 10 litre pots under well-watered conditions in the tunnel house on Western
    Sydney University Hawkesbury campus for 4 weeks prior to measurement at the Australian
    Synchrotron. Individuals of A. aneura were grown from seed on Hawkesbury campus
    in 25 litre soil bags. At the time of measurement, plants were 2-3 years old and
    ranged in height from 1.5 m to 2.5 m; stems were 10-25 mm in diameter at the scan
    site. For each experiment, plant material was transported to the Australian Synchrotron
    (Clayton, VIC, Australia) and allowed to dehydrate naturally over a period of
    ~5 d. Three to five plants of each species were scanned at multiple time points
    (between five and nine time points) over 4-5 d of dehydration.

  methods: Acquired 2D longitudinal raw images were reconstructed into a series of
    2159 cross-sectional images with XLICT workflow 2015 (CSIRO) using the FBP (Paganin
    et al., 2002) reconstruction algorithm. For each scan, a cross-sectional slice
    was selected for analysis based on clarity. When plants were scanned at multiple
    time points, the precise scan location was marked with correction fluid on the
    stem and root, and slices used for analysis came from the same position within
    the scan zone. Embolized vessels were measured (area and diameter) and counted
    using 'Threshold' and 'Analyze particles' functions in Image J software (1.48).
    Total vessel counts were performed manually on fully embolized 'cut' scans in
    most cases. For E. saligna, total vessel counts were obtained from scans where
    both air- and water-filled vessels were clear and easy to distinguish. Vulnerability
    curves for C.  deodara were based on measurement of embolized xylem cross-sectional
    area, since the spatial resolution of images attained at IMBL was not sufficient
    to count individual tracheids in this species. We used the percentage of embolized
    conduits to estimate hydraulic impairment during drought. Using the percentage
    of embolized conduits could potentially underestimate vulnerability for species
    with a wide distribution of vessel diameters (Brodersen et  al., 2013); however,
    our data demonstrate that this issue does not significantly impact the shape of
    vulnerability curves or estimates of vulnerability curve parameters in the majority
    of species (Gauthey et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020). Therefore, the percentage
    of embolized conduits was plotted against water potential for all samples. A re-parameterized
    Weibull function was fitted to produce a vulnerability curve. From the curve,
    we calculated the stem xylem water potential (xylem tension) at which 12% and
    50% of vessels were embolized (P12 and P50, respectively) and 95% confidence intervals
    (CIs) using the fitplc package (Duursma and Choat, 2017) in R v.3.2.0 (R Core
    Team, 2015).

  methods: Two-dimensional cross-sectional images were examined for patterns of embolism
    spread as xylem water potential decreased. Individual plants were rescanned at
    the same location, making patterns of embolism propagation easy to follow. By
    determining the location and distribution of embolized conduits over the course
    of the dehydration, a general pattern of spread could be defined for each species.
    Native embolism present in xylem conduits at the start of the experiment under
    well-hydrated conditions was defined as the mean percentage embolism from initial
    scans of each plant if the first scan occurred at a water potential higher than
    the calculated P12 for that species. Three-dimensional volume rendering and segmentation
    of embolized conduits was performed with the open source visualization software
    Drishti (Limaye, 2012).
