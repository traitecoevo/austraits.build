  description: This project, extending over five decades, aimed to develop an authoritative
    flora list and acquire data on phenology, threatened species, endemism, old and
    young landscapes, phytogeography, old lineages, and fire responses at Two Peoples
    Bay Nature Reserve.

  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: Flora list and phenology ^p Florabase (Western Australian Herbarium
    1998-2024) has been integral to compiling the final flora list, enabling checks
    on correct names, authorship, collectors, phenology, geographical distribution,
    identifications, and individual specimen labels. Currently with 821,870 specimens
    of Western Australian plants and fungi databased in Florabase, the first co-author
    worked comprehensively through the 2547 specimens that gave the location 'Two
    Peoples Bay' (n = 2428); or 'Two People Bay' (n = 119). Other searches based on
    place names enabled comparison of collecting activity at Two Peoples Bay Nature
    Reserve with that conducted nearby. ^p In the compilation of the flora list, plant
    collections or lists of plant collections made by the following people at locations
    shown in Hopkins et al. (2024a) and in Fig. 1 and Table S1 herein have been examined
    mainly at the Western Australian Herbarium (PERTH), L. A. Moore and G. T. Smith
    (1974-1982, CSIRO plant study transects, Locations 1, 2, 3 and 6); M. C. Ellis,
    L. A. Moore, F. N. Robinson, and G. T. Smith (1969-1982, noisy scrub-bird study
    areas, locations 4 and 5); R. E. S. Sokolowski (1976, Location 7); I. Abbott (1980,
    Locations 7, 8 and 9); N. Smith and Kolichis (1980, Coffin Island); E. M. Gude
    (1990, wetlands in Locations 2, 3, 4, and 13). Collections in the more general
    Regions 10-12 were made by A. J. M. Hopkins (1975-1987), L. A. Moore and G. T.
    Smith (1974-1982), A. A. Burbidge (1970-1971), R. E. S. Sokolowski (1971-1978),
    G. Folley (1978-1982), and S. D. Hopper (1973-2021). Other collections for which
    no specific locality data were given have been incorporated without annotation.
    These collections result from visits to the Reserve by N. T. Burbidge from the
    Herbarium Australiense (1973), J. Powell from the National Herbarium in Sydney
    (1980), and A. S. George (1964, 1967 and 1971), N. G. Marchant (1971) and S. Paust
    (1971) from the Western Australian Herbarium. Many other collectors have been
    active over the past four decades, too numerous to list (but see Florabase at
    Western Australian Herbarium 1998-2024). Of note have been general collections
    of G. J. Keighery (1972-2019), the Miialyiin/Angove Lake and other collections
    of E. M. Sandiford, D. A. Rathbone, and E. J. Hickman (2008, 2013, 2017), the
    sedge and other collections of K. L. Wilson, R. L. Barrett, and S. Barrett (2008,
    2013), general collections of E. J. Croxford (1980-2009) and J. A. Cochrane (1994-2017)
    and granite collections by M. Dilly (past 5 years). ^p To test the comprehensiveness
    of the herbarium record, two approaches were adopted. First, noted orchidologist
    Andrew Brown compiled a full list of orchids on the Reserve, that he has seen
    and recorded in field notebooks over several decades. Orchids are perhaps the
    best studied of all families in the field, with abundant published material to
    assist identification (e.g. see Brown 2022 for the latest books). Brown is one
    of the most capable field students of Western Australian orchids, so any additions
    to the herbarium list for Orchidaceae are likely to be in his notebooks. In addition,
    Garry Brockman, an emerging taxonomist of Western Australian orchids, also provided
    a list of orchids seen on the Reserve over several decades, from his field notebooks.
    Second, special collection techniques were used by S. D. Hopper and colleagues
    to document granite flora, including the random stratified walk method, compilation
    of fieldbook herbaria, as well as examination of pertinent literature. These techniques
    are detailed elsewhere (Hopper et al. 2021b). ^p The large number of collectors
    and collections of Two Peoples Bay material has posed taxonomic problems in the
    compilation of a flora for the Reserve. Many of the identifications are not supported
    by voucher specimens and some specimens are in distant herbaria. However, there
    is now a substantial, though incomplete, collection located at the Western Australian
    Herbarium (PERTH). Field herbaria are also located at PERTH and at the Two Peoples
    Bay Research Station, as well as in the comprehensive field notebooks of S. D.
    Hopper. As far as possible, specimens incorporated in these herbaria are consistently
    named in Table S1 by the first and second co-authors to match those used in Florabase
    as of March 2024. ^p Plants recorded on granite OCBILs are highlighted on the
    master list (Table S1). In Table S2, these same species are categorised according
    to life history (terrestrial/aquatic; perennial/annual; herbaceous; graminoid/geophyte;
    ferns-fern allies; vine) and fire response (resprouter/seeder) based on the literature
    and herbarium records (see Hopper et al. 2021b) and actual fire responses recorded
    on the Reserve the first year following the 2015 wildfire. The occurrence of species
    in special habitats on the Reserve's granite outcrops was noted as on moss mats,
    herbfields, dwarf shrubs and Borya, larger shrubs and thickets/low forest flanking
    the granite (Nikulinsky and Hopper 2008; Hopper et al. 2021b). ^p In the 1990s,
    Table S1 was organised systematically by family based on an outdated morphological
    classification of vascular plants. However, the significant recent advances in
    molecular phylogenetics have enabled the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group to rearrange
    families according to their genetic relationships through four published iterations
    (The Angiosperm Phylogeny Group 2016). The Western Australian Herbarium has reorganised
    its collection predominantly in line with Angiosperm Phylogeny Group IV. However,
    certain families not recognised in Angiosperm Phylogeny Group IV such as Centrolepidaceae
    are recognised at PERTH. This rendered difficult the replication of family arrangements
    between that used in the 1990s and that in Florabase today. Consequently, Table
    S1 aims to compromise by arranging families alphabetically within major phylogenetic
    groups of ferns and fern allies, gymnosperms, early branching dicots, monocots
    and core eudicots. This system recognises all families used by the Western Australian
    Herbarium in Florabase. In Table S2, genera on granite outcrops are arranged alphabetically
    for ease of use, with aliens marked by an asterisk (*) and listed first ahead
    of native vascular plants.

    description: granite outcrops and dune and wetland lowlands
    notes: Two Peoples Bay Nature Reserve occupies 4774.7 ha on the south coast of Western Australia, east of Albany. Physiographically, it is dominated by the granite inselberg Maardjitup Gurlin (Noongar name for Mt Gardner), attaining 408 m in height at the end of the eastern peninsula (Fig. 1). An isthmus to the west gives way to lowlands of dunes and wetlands, with a low lateritic plateau in the north west (Smith 1987). Much of the western south coast is flanked by limestone rocks and platform reefs (Sinker Reef). Four islands are included in the Reserve (Fig. 1), which receives approximately 800 mm of rainfall each year.
