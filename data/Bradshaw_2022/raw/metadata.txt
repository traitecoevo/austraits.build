Variance in plant functional traits in Eucalyptus baxteri and E. obliqua - a pilot study to assess utility for inferring climate vulnerability

METADATA

###

SLA_data (leaf trait data):


$Location: Site location (text)

$Tree_ID: Code assigned to individual tree

$Leaf_ID: Code assigned to individual leaf sample

$Species: Eucalyptus species (baxteri or obliqua)

$Leaf_mass_mg: Dry leaf mass in mg

$Leaf_length_cm: Dry leaf length in cm

$Leaf_width_cm: Dry leaf width in cm

$LWR: leaf length:width ratio (leaf/width)

$Leaf_area_mm2: Dry one-sided leaf area in mm^2

$sla: Specific Leaf Area (Leaf_area_mm2/Leaf_mass_mg)

$Longitude: Spatial site coordinate x

$Latitude: Spatial site coordinate y

$site_spp: Combined site/species tag for plotting

###

SSD_data (wood trait data):


$Location: Site location (text)

$Tree_ID: Code assigned to individual tree

$Species: Eucalyptus species (baxteri or obliqua)

$Mass_mg: Dry wood sample mass in mg

$Volume_mm3: Wood sample volume in mm^3

$site_spp: Combined site/species tag for plotting

$MAP_mm: mean annual rainfall in mm


######

Species_trait_boxplots:

Difference in four functional traits between the two stringybark species over all sites. Box plots depict median (lines) and interquartile range (boxes). Whisker show 1.5x interquartile range from box margins and points are outliers. Differences in these traits may correspond to different environmental tolerances.

#

Sites_traits_boxplots:

Boxplots depicting differences in four functional traits among eight stringybark sites (two sites had both species). Sites are in ascending order according to rainfall MAP.

#

Individuals_traits_boxplots:

Boxplots depicting variation in three functional leaf traits (SLA, L:W ratio and leaf area) within and between individual stringybark trees. Blue: E. baxteri; Yellow: E. obliqua. ID codes (x-axis) group trees by sites (in alphabetical order by species).

#

Trat_rainfall_lm:

Scatterplots showing relationships between rainfall gradients and values of four key functional traits. Values for leaf traits are the mean taken across replicate leaf samples per individual. Trend lines show OLS regressions. Dashed lines are non-significant trends.

#

SB_variance_table:

Variance partitioning (SS) of functional traits in Eucalyptus baxteri and E. obliqua across eight sites.


#####

Scan1-Scan17:

Raw leaf sample (and some associated vouchers) scanned images.


#####

SB_traits_Rcode.R:

R code to load datasets and reproduce variance partitioning stats and figures.
