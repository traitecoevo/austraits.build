  description: This pilot study investigated variation in plant functional traits
    of stringyback eucalypt species, Eucalyptus obliqua and E. baxteri, along a gradient
    of mean annual rainfall in the Mount Lofty Ranges region of South Australia. The
    aim was to test the utility of functional traits for inferring relative climate
    vulnerability and to inform the level of replication needed in sampling within
    and between individuals and sites to capture variation.

  sampling_strategy: This pilot project examined variation in plant functional traits
    of Eucalyptus obliqua and E. baxteri, across eight sites spanning a gradient of
    mean annual rainfall of approximately 700 - 1100 mm. Traits included were 1. Stem
    specific density, 2. Leaf area, 3. Leaf length-to-width ratio, and 4. Specific
    leaf area. We sampled three - five individual trees per site and collected 1x
    stem samples and 5x leaf samples per individual for analysis. Stem samples were
    taken from young wood sections approximately 1.5 cm diameter (Perez-Harguindeguy
    et al. 2016), selected straight sections with no branching where possible. Young
    but fully mature sun leaves with minimal insect damage were selected as leaf samples.

  methods: Stem samples were taken from young wood sections approximately 1.5 cm diameter
    (Perez-Harguindeguy et al. 2016), selected straight sections with no branching
    where possible. To calculate SSD, we calculated fresh volume as the cross-sectional
    area of the stem segment multiplied by its length and also, for comparison, we
    measured the volume by placing each sample into a measuring cylinder full of water.
    The displacement of water when the sample is added (final volume- initial volume)
    gave the volume of the sample. Samples were then air dried and weighed on a 0.1
    mg balance after oven drying at 100oC. SSD is equal to oven dry mass divided by
    fresh volume.

  methods: To calculate leaf area, length:width ratio and SLA, we pressed and dried
    leaf samples and scanned them with a scale bar. ImageJ was used to measure one-sided
    leaf area, length and width. A recent pilot analysis in a set of eucalypt species
    showed that that amount of eucalypt leaf shrinkage is small (~10%) and consistent
    across samples (Morgan et al. 2021). Therefore, the use of dry leaf area for SLA
    is valid as it is not biased by shrinkage, and can be converted to fresh leaf
    area with minimal error.
