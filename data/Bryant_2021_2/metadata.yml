  description: An investigation of seasonal acclimation of traits that improve drought
    tolerance in trees remains poorly resolved to improve understanding how plants
    acclimate to drought is crucial for predicting future vulnerability.

  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: 2.1 Study site and sampling design ^p The study site on the Daintree
    River, Daintree National Park, Far North Queensland (16°17'24.8″S 145°24'36.8″E),
    has a tropical monsoonal climate. Long-term monthly rainfall and temperature data
    were obtained from the Low Isles meteorological station (1968-2017; http://bom.gov.au/climate/data/
    accessed March, 2019). Mean annual precipitation for the Daintree region is 2,168
    ± 468 mm y-1 with ~80% of the rainfall occurring from December through May. Peak
    mean daily maximum and minimum air temperatures occur in December (32.5 ± 0.9°C)
    and July (20.5 ± 0.7°C), respectively. Temperature increases and infrequent rainfall
    over the dry season are associated with progressive increases in daily average
    vapour pressure deficit (VPD). ^p Seasonal measurements were conducted early and
    late in the dry season, 13-25 August and 13-25 November 2018, respectively. Micrometeorological
    measurements of temperature and relative humidity were recorded at 10 min intervals
    at the study site during the study period using a portable weather station (Kestrel
    3500 Delta T Meter, Neilsen-Kellerman Co., Boothwyn, PA) mounted 3 m above water
    level at high tide. Shoots with intact healthy, fully expanded foliage, were collected
    from the same stand of Sonneratia alba trees, ~ 6-7 m in height and statistical
    comparisons were made of mean values. Shoots were sampled at a height ranging
    from 1.5 to 3 m above high-tide and were transported to the lab in plastic bags
    with moistened paper towel. ^p As S. alba predominantly grows in loosely consolidated
    sediments along the estuary margin, the surface water salinities are representative
    of those experienced by their shallow root systems (Ball & Pidsley, 1995). To
    assess the estuarine osmotic potentials (psi-est) experienced by S. alba, a handheld
    refractometer (A.S.T. Co. Ltd., Japan) was used to measure salinity of estuary
    surface water at high tide. Salinities were averaged from three salinity measurements
    per day, repeated for each of 5 days during each of the early and late dry season
    sampling periods. Osmotic potentials of estuarine water were calculated based
    on the fraction of seawater, where standard seawater has a salinity of 35 ppt
    and an osmotic potential of -2.4 MPa at 25°C (Harvey, 1966).

  methods: Minimum leaf conductance (gmin), was determined for leaves from each of
    nine trees in the early dry season and five in the late dry season. Minimal leaf
    conductance, gmin, was determined by methods previously described (Kerstiens,
    1996; Sack et al., 2003) as the cuticular transpiration, per two sided area, per
    mole fraction difference in water vapour between leaf and air, where air inside
    the leaf was assumed saturated with water vapour (Pearcy et al., 2000; Supporting
    Information).

  methods: Leaf water relations were determined from pressure-volume (p-v) curves,
    that is, plots of leaf water potential versus relative water content (RWC). A
    p-v curve was constructed for one mature leaf from each of seven trees in the
    early dry season (n = 7) and six trees in the late dry season (n = 6) with the
    bench drying method (Tyree & Hammel, 1972) using a Scholander pressure chamber
    (1050D, PMS Instrument Albany; Supporting Information). Key leaf traits and water
    relations parameters were determined, including leaf dry mass per area (LMA),
    saturated water content (SWC), bulk osmotic potential at turgor loss point (psi-TLP),
    relative water content at turgor loss point (RWCat TLP), osmotic potential at
    full hydration (psi-O), leaf bulk modulus of elasticity (e), symplastic modulus
    of elasticity (e-symplast), and fractions of leaf water held in the apoplast (Af)
    and symplast (Sf) were calculated from the p-v curves (Bartlett et al., 2012).

  methods: Diurnal changes in stem and leaf water status, gas exchange and leaf hydraulic

    system (LI-COR 6400XT, LI-COR Biosciences, Nebraska).  Photosynthetically active
    radiation was standardized at 1000 umol photons m-2 s-1 and the flow rate was
    set to 500 umol s-1, and all other parameters (CO2, temperature, humidity) were
    left at ambient levels. After attaching the gas analyser head, measurements were
    logged after photosynthetic rate and stomatal conductance stabilized (usually
    2-3 min). The time elapsed between the first tree and last tree during a measurement
    cycle was <45 min. After gas exchange measurements, the exposed and the wrapped
    leaves were harvested, placed into zip-lock bags and their water potentials measured
    in the lab within 90 min. Leaf hydraulic conductance (Kleaf) was calculated from
    diurnal gas exchange and water potential measurements on an area basis as, E/(psi-stem
    - psi-leaf). where E is the transpiration rate and psi-stem - psi-leaf represents
    the water potential gradient between the transpiring leaf and stem.nknown
