  description: The aim of our study was to determine how the leaf mechanical properties
    that contribute to the phenomenon of sclerophylly vary among species in relation
    to soil nutrients.
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: The locality was selected because of the close proximity of markedly
    different soil types, allowing investigation of soil effects in a common climate.
    Three soil/landform types were selected for study to provide contrasting nutrient
    status, based on McArthur (1991); (1) red earths developed on dolerite (moderate
    nutrient status); (2) exposed laterite developed from Precambrian granite with
    shallow gravelly soil often restricted to pockets in the laterite (low nutrient
    status); (3) deep grey sands over pale ferruginous gravels and laterite (very
    low nutrient status). Five patches of each soil type were used for replication,
    interspersed as far as possible. Mechanical properties and associated leaf traits
    related to sclerophylly were determined in 14-19 of the most common dicot species
    on each soil type (all woody shrubs or trees, total of 44 species, Table 2) in
    spring (September) 2001. One plant per species was generally sampled at each of
    the five replicate patches, but some species could not be located in all five
    patches so samples were spread through a lesser number of patches (Table 2).

    description: The study was undertaken at Tutanning Nature Reserve in southwestern
      Australia (ca. 150 km south-east of Perth). This region has a diverse sclerophyllous
      flora, a commonly larger leaf size than some other sclerophyllous floras which
      facilitates some mechanical measurements, and mosaics of soils with contrasting
      nutrient status. The reserve is a 2310-ha island of natural vegetation surrounded
      by cleared land. It experiences a Mediterranean climate with an annual rainfall
      of 448 mm, 80% of which falls from May to October, and a mean 96 daily maximum
      temperature of 23.1 C (Bureau of Meteorology for Pingelly, 20 km west of the
      reserve). The locality was selected because of the close proximity of markedly
      different soil types, allowing investigation of soil effects in a common climate.
      The Reserve includes the residuals of a Tertiary lateritic plateau, where exposed
      indurated laterite and deep siliceous sands or gravels overlying the laterite
      are flanked by areas where the laterite has been stripped to expose granite
      and dolerite (Brown and Hopkins, 1983; McArthur, 1991). Some changes, such as
      from exposed laterite to deep grey sands, can take place over distances less
      than 50 m. The soils overlying granite and dolerite support woodland dominated
      by Eucalyptus and/or Allocasuarina. The exposed laterite typically supports
      shrublands dominated by Proteaceae, and the deep sand supports shrublands dominated
      by Myrtaceae, Proteaceae and Fabaceae. Both shrublands are exceptionally species-rich
      (Brown and Hopkins, 1983) and may include emergent mallee-form eucalypts.

  methods: Sunlit leaves, or terminal branchlets in Allocasuarina species, fully expanded
    during the previous growth season, were collected haphazardly across the plant,
    soon after sunrise to maximise water content (soils were moist due to spring rains
    and leaves were fully hydrated). They were enclosed in wet absorbent paper in
    sealed plastic bags. Petioles were removed and fresh weight was measured on one
    or more leaves from each replicate plant. Leaf area of the same leaves was measured
    using image analysis (Bioscan, Monash University),

    Neutral Detergent Fibre, NDF). Foliar N and NDF were used to derive the Loveless
    Sclerophylly Index (SI, 100 crude fibre dry weight/crude protein dry weight: Loveless,
    1961, 1962). NDF was measured following Van Soest et al. (1991). Foliar N was
    measured using a Leco CHN-2000 analyzer. SI was calculated as the ratio of NDF
    dry weight to protein dry weight (N x 6.25).'
