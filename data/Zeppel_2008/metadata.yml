  description: This paper compares rates of tree water use, Huber value, canopy conductance
    and canopy decoupling of two disparate, co-occurring tree species, in a stand
    of remnant native vegetation in temperate Australia in order to compare their
    relative behaviour seasonally and during and after a drought.

  sampling_strategy: The study site was located in remnant woodland on the Liverpool
    Plains (roughly 90km south of Tamworth) on the north-west plains of New South
    Wales, Australia. Vegetation at the site consisted of open woodland, with an average
    height of 14m, dominated by Eucalyptus crebra F. Muell. and Callitris glaucophylla
    J. Thompson & L.A.S. Johnson. These two species were uniformly spread with little
    clumping, and account for around 75% of the tree basal area at the site. Total
    tree basal area for the site was 23.8 ± 3.4 m2 ha-1 and leaf area index was generally
    1.0-1.2 throughout the year, which meant the remnant forest was sparse, with little
    shading of trees occurring. The eucalypt population had a lower density than that
    of the Callitris (42 stems ha-1 compared with 212 stems ha-1), but contributed
    75% of the basal area of the two species because the average diameter of the Eucalyptus
    was much larger than that of the Callitris. ^p Seven C. glaucophylla and eight
    E. crebra trees were destructively sampled, to determine leaf area and sapwood
    area, in each of December 2002 (summer), June 2003 (winter) and January 2003 (summer).
    The DBH of each tree and the diameter of each branch (measured at the junction
    with the stem) were measured. Three branches from each tree were selected from
    the lower-, mid- and upper-third of the canopy.  For sap flow measurement and
    transpiration, a minimum of seven and a  maximum of 15 trees, that represented
    the range of size classes present at the study site, were instrumented with commercial
    sap flow sensors for each species at each sampling time.

  methods: Three branches from each tree were selected from the lower-, mid- and upper-third
    of the canopy and the total projected leaf area of each branch was determined
    with a leaf area meter (WinDIAS Delta-T Devices Ltd, Burwell, Cambridge, UK).
    C. glaucophylla leaves were examined under a binocular microscope, and were found
    to be three-sided. The projected area of photosynthetically active material was
    measured only on C. glaucophylla. A regression of branch diameter and leaf area
    for each species was then used to calculate the total leaf area per tree from
    the branch diameters of all branches for each individual tree. Regressions of
    DBH v. total branch diameter and individual branch diameter v. leaf area per stem
    were also calculated. This allowed an estimate of leaf area to be calculated from
    DBH by allometric relationships (Vann et al. 1998; Burrows et al. 2000; Santiago
    et al. 2000). Sapwood cross-sectional area was measured on two 5-mm-diameter cores,
    taken from the trunk at 1.3-m height. Sapwood area was measured on each tree that
    was instrumented with Greenspan sap flow loggers. In addition, sapwood area was
    measured on trees that were felled. A distinct colour change was observed between
    bark, sapwood and heartwood in both species. Huber value (Hv) was calculated by
    dividing sapwood area (m2) by leaf area (m2).

  methods: Maximum hourly canopy conductance (Gc) of each tree was estimated from
    hourly transpiration and climate data by using the inverted Penman-Monteith equation
    (Lu et al. 2003). Because there can be a time lag between transpiration at the
    canopy level, and sap flow in the tree stem 1.3 m above ground, owing to stem
    storage of water in trees (Schulze et al. 1985; Ewers and Oren 2000; Lhomme et
    al. 2001), it was necessary to estimate the length of this time lag so that transpiration
    rates and Gc values could be most accurately modelled with the Penman-Monteith
    equation (Martin et al. 2001; Phillips et al. 2002). Regressions between hourly
    values of transpiration (m3 water per m2 leaf area h-1) and radiation (MJ m-2)
    on clear sunny days were performed for time differences of -1, 0, 1 and 2 h. The
    regression with the highest r2 was determined to be the time lag, and regressions
    were performed for two or three trees, for each sampling period (winter 2002,
    r2 = 0.95; summer 2002-03, r2 = 0.72; winter 2003, r2 = 0.96; and summer 2003-04,
    r2 = 0.89). Each season had a time lag of one hour, with the exception of summer
    2002-2003, which had no time lag, possibly owing to an extremely large rain event
    (93 mm) preceding the sampling period. Therefore, a lag of 1 h was used in all
    hourly time-step calculations, except summer 2002-2003. With transpiration as
    an input, GC (mmh-1) was estimated (see manuscript for equation).

  methods: Sap velocity was measured by the heat pulse technique with commercial sap
    flow sensors (Greenspan Technology Pty Ltd, Warwick, Qld, Australia). Two SF-100
    probe sets (four sensors) were inserted at 90◦ to each other in each tree. A preliminary
    Monte Carlo simulation showed that four probes per tree were adequate (Zeppel
    et al. 2004). A minimum of seven and a maximum of 15 trees, that represented the
    range of size classes present at the study site, were instrumented for each species
    at each sampling time. Sap velocities were monitored at 15-min intervals during
    a 2-week period in July-August 2002 (mid-drought; winter), January-February 2003
    (mid-drought; summer), July-August 2003 (post-drought; winter) and February-March
    2004 (post-drought; summer). Tree water use was calculated for each sensor for
    12 consecutive days after allowing 2 days for development of the wound that develops
    as a result of drilling into the wood (Olbrich 1991; O'Grady 2000). The weighted
    averages technique of Hatton and Wu (1995) was used to convert sap velocities
    to volume of transpired water. Volume fractions of wood and water in the sapwood
    were determined gravimetrically on 5-mm cores taken from 10 trees of each species
    on two occasions.
