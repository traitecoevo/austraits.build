  description: We examined the relationships between productivity and diversity using
    inventory data from 977 plots in 386 multispecies reforestation plantings. Diversity
    was estimated using observed species richness and three functional diversity indices
    calculated from four functional traits; specific leaf area, wood density, seed
    mass and maximum attainable height.
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: Additional trait data were collected in the field for 129 species
    for SLA and 137 for wood density. Trait values from field collected data were
    estimated on five individuals (five samples per individual for SLA, one sample
    for wood density). Individuals were located mostly in protected areas, within
    the species' natural range. Mature plants were randomly selected within stands.
  original_file: Data extracted from the two files 'Staples_2019_SLA.csv' and 'Staples_2019_wood-density.csv'.
    The two files were combined and saved in the AusTraits project.

  trait_name: specific_leaf_area
  value_type: raw_value
  replicates: 1
  methods: Adult, sun-exposed foliage chosen wherever possible. Dominant photosynthetic
    tissue used (phyllodes for Acacia species, entire cladode structure for Casuarina
    etc). Petioles and rachi included in surface area and mass estimates. One-sided
    ("projected") surface area estimated using a digital scanner on leaves and using
    image software. Mass estimated after drying at 60C. Trait data collected in the
    field for 129 species for SLA, following protocols in Perez-Harguindeguy 2013.
    Trait values from field collected data were estimated on five individuals (5 measurements
    per individual) for SLA. NB - No identifier available to link raw measurments
    to individuals.
