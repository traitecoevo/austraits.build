  description: functional trait measurements in relation to landscape position in
    alpine habitats (frost hollows vs. higher slope positions)
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: Data on species occurrences and functional traits were collected
    from the Bogong High Plains in northeast Victoria, Australia between Nov 2011
    and May 2012 (the austral summer). The Bogong High Plains are located on alpine
    and sub-alpine plateaus at elevations between 1500 and 1900 m in the Great Dividing
    Range. Air temperatures vary widely, ranging from -20 deg C in the winter to above
    30 deg C in the summermonths (Williams 1987). We selected 23 frost hollows, which
    spanned a range of elevations and steepness, and had a gradation of vegetation
    types. One or two transects were laid out at each frost hollow, depending on accessibility.
    Transects varied in length and steepness, running from open woodland to open heathland.
    Thirty-six transects in total were established along north- and south-facing slopes
    of these frost hollows. We set up three 10 m x 10 m plots along each transect,
    where we collected shrub species occurrence and trait data. Plots at the top of
    the slopes were placed in open woodland. Bottom plots were located in open heathland
    on flatter areas at the bottom of the slope. The middle plots were placed approximately
    midway between the plots at the top and bottom of the slope. Because the sites
    differed in lengths and steepness of slopes, the distances between plots also
    varied in length and attitudinal gradients. Some frost hollows in the area may
    occur within wetlands and bogs (Wahren et al. 1999). Soil properties like soil
    moisture and chemistry might therefore change along the slopes towards the frost
    hollows. In this study, we selected sites that were well-drained to avoid confounding
    the effects of soilmoisture and temperature. Soil depth and moisture were similar
    between frost hollows and side slopes (data not shown). We also measured temperatures
    at different positions for three of the slopes, demonstrating that the bottom
    of the slope reaches lower temperatures and spends more time at sub-zero temperatures
    (see Appendix S1). Study species and plant functional traits All shrub species
    that occurred within the 108 plots were recorded (three plots on each of 36 transects).
    Trees and herbaceous species were excluded from this study as they could have
    different ecological strategies (Koerner 2012). We recorded the relative foliage
    projected area of each species within each plot as a percentage of the total area
    of the plot (Appendix S2). Functional traits that relate to a plant's susceptibility
    to frost damage were selected, and measured from a subset of individuals for each
    species (see Table 1 for a list of functional traits).

- var_in: Height.cm
  unit_in: cm
  trait_name: .na
  value_type: raw_value
  replicates: 1
  methods: We measured vegetative height from three individuals of each species within
    each plot, and maximum height of each species was obtained from across all the
    measured individuals. The number of replicates per species ranged from three to
    268 individuals, and depended on species occurrences across all plots; some species
    were only present in one plot.
- var_in: SLA.cm2/g
  unit_in: cm2/g
  trait_name: specific_leaf_area
  value_type: raw_value
  replicates: 1
  methods: Leaf area and SLA of each species were measured from a subset of individuals;
    because occurrences varied greatly between species, number of individuals from
    which leaf trait measurements were taken varied for each species, ranging from
    three to 78 individuals per species. Average one-sided leaf area was measured
    using ImageJ software (Schneider et al. 2012). Because most species had small
    leaves, we measured average leaf area and dry mass in batches of multiple leaves.
    Leaves were oven-dried at 70 deg C for 72 h and their dry mass obtained (Perez-Harguindeguy
    et al. 2013). SLA was calculated as the ratio of the one-sided area of each group
    of leaves to its dry mass (Perez-Harguindeguy et al. 2013).
- var_in: lumen.fraction
  unit_in: dimensionless
  trait_name: vessel_lumen_fraction
  value_type: raw_value
  replicates: 1
  methods: Proportion of section occupied by xylem lumen (lumen area / x-sectional
    area). We recorded xylem anatomical traits from two individuals of each species.
    Transverse stem cross-sections, each 0.1-mm thick and extending from pith to bark,
    weremade using a microtome. Sections were photographed under a compoundmicroscope,
    and xylem traits measured using ImageJ (Schneider et al. 2012). We calculated
    the lumen fraction from the ratio of xylem lumen area to the total area of the
    section, the average cross- sectional area of each xylem vessel, and measured
    the vessel density of each stem section, i.e. the number of xylem vessels per
    unit area, by dividing the number of vessels observed in each section by the total
    area of the section (Zanne et al. 2010).
- var_in: non-lumen.fraction
  unit_in: dimensionless
  trait_name: vessel_non_lumen_fraction
  value_type: raw_value

  methods: Proportion of section occupied by xylem lumen (lumen area / x-sectional

    the vessel density of each stem section, i.e. the number of xylem vessels per
    unit area, by dividing the number of vessels observed in each section by the total
    area of the section (Zanne et al. 2010).
- var_in: Stem.Density
  unit_in: g/cm3
  trait_name: wood_density
  value_type: raw_value
  replicates: 1
  methods: We measured stem specific densities of each species from a subset of individuals
    across all sites; sample size for each species ranged from one to 24 individuals.
    Stem cuttings 50-mm long were removed 200 mm from the tip of the stems. The fresh
    volume of each stem cutting was determined using the volume displacement method
    (Hacke et al. 2000; Perez-Harguindeguy et al. 2013), and stem specific density
    was calculated from the ratio of stem dry mass to fresh volume.

  unit_in: 10-4 mm2
  trait_name: .na
  value_type: raw_value

  methods: Total area within section occupied by xylem lumen. We recorded xylem anatomical
    traits fromtwo individuals of each species. Transverse stem cross-sections, each
    0.1-mm thick and extending from pith to bark, weremade using a microtome. Sections
    were photographed under a compoundmicroscope, and xylem traits measured using
    ImageJ (Schneider et al. 2012). We calculated the lumen fraction from the ratio
    of xylem lumen area to the total area of the section, the average cross- sectional
    area of each xylem vessel, and measured the vessel density of each stem section,
    i.e. the number of xylem vessels per unit area, by dividing the number of vessels
    observed in each section by the total area of the section (Zanne et al. 2010).
