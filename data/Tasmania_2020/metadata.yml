  notes: The custom R code filters out interpolated values, as identified in the submitted data file. The custom R code also filters out values known to be sourced from herbarium databases already in AusTraits. In particular, seed mass values that are identical to those in Kew_2019_1 are filtered out. Plant height values that are identical to those in Barlow_1981, CPBR_2002, GrassBase_2014, RBGSYD_2014, SAH_2014, TMAG_2009, and WAH_1998 have been removed.
