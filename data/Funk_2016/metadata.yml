  description: Australian subset of a worldwide comparison of functional traits in
    invasive versus native species in mediterranean-climate ecosystems
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: We selected eight moderately to heavily invaded MCE communities
    including grasslands, shrublands, and woodlands. Our sites had similar mean annual
    precipitation (330-834 mm), but varied greatly in soil nutrient availability,
    grazing frequency, and fi re history. At each site, we collected functional trait
    data from five individuals of the most common invasive (5-9 species per site)
    and native (7-47 species per site) species for a total of 39 invasive and 129
    native species. Some species occurred in more than one region. Physiological and
    chemical traits were measured on fully expanded,recently mature leaves in the
    middle of the spring growing season, prior to fl owering.

  unit_in: .na
  trait_name: plant_growth_form
  entity_type: population
  value_type: mode
  basis_of_value: expert_score

  methods: We used the following six life form categories, petaloid monocot perennials,
    non- petaloid monocot annuals, non- petaloid monocot perennials, annual forbs,
    perennial forbs, and woody species. Petaloid monocots, or lilioids, is an informal,
    polyphyletic group of five monocot orders with similar flower morphology (from
    manuscript, although these are not the values in the spreadsheet)

  trait_name: leaf_mass_per_area
  entity_type: individual
  value_type: raw
  basis_of_value: measurement
  replicates: 1
  methods: After photosynthetic measures, leaves were collected, scanned to determine
    leaf area, dried at 65 deg C for 3 d, and weighed to determine LMA.

  unit_in: cm/mg
  trait_name: specific_root_length
  entity_type: individual
  value_type: raw
  basis_of_value: measurement
  replicates: 1
  methods: Specific root length (SRL) was sampled for species with rooting depth less
    than 100 cm. Roots were either subsampled from excavated root systems or taken
    from soil cores made at 10 cm depth immediately adjacent (2-5 cm) to the stem.
    Root length was measured and roots were dried at 65 deg C for 3 d and weighed
    to determine SRL (cm 2 g-1).

  unit_in: .na
  trait_name: .na
  entity_type: population
  value_type: mode
  basis_of_value: expert_score
  replicates: 5
  methods: We used three categories of root depth (0-30 cm, 30-100 cm, or >100 cm).
    For annuals, perennial forbs, and small- statured woody species, we excavated
    the entire root system and measured maximum root depth. For large woody species,
    we assumed a root depth greater than 100 cm.

  methods: 'Nutrient acquisition strategy was assigned using information gathered
    from the literature (Appendix S2). We grouped species into four NAS categories:
    (1) facultative or obligate mycorrhizal, (2) nitrogen-fixing with or without mycorrhizae,
    (3) specialized roots (i.e., cluster roots, fine roots and long root hairs, parasitic
    root structures), and (4) none of the above (i.e., no specialized NAS, non- mycorrhizal
    plants).'

  methods: Photosynthetic and transpiration rates were measured with a LI- 6400 portable
    photosynthesis system (LICOR, Lincoln, Nebraska, USA). All measurements were conducted
    at saturating light levels (1600 umol photons m-2 s-1 ), 400 uL L-1 CO 2 , leaf
    temperature of 25 deg C, and at relative humidity of 40-60%. When necessary, photosynthetic
