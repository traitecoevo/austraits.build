  description: Compilation of published and unpublished data on the vulnerability
    of the transport system to drought-induced embolism for woody species worldwide;
    only Australian component included in AusTraits
  basis_of_record: literature
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: The data set was compiled from published papers and unpublished
    results of the authors (see Supplementary Table 1), including 480 species from
    172 sites, with 384 angiosperm and 96 gymnosperm species. Genera and species names
    were checked for orthography and synonymy using TaxonScrubber (version 2.1; http://www.salvias.net/pages/taxonscrubber.html),
    the International Plant Names Index (http://www.ipni.org), Tropicos (http://www.tropicos.org),
    Phylomatic (http://www.phylodiversity.net/phylomatic/) and the Angiosperm Phylogeny
    Website (http://www.mobot.org/MOBOT/research/APweb/). Samples based on measurements
    of roots, petioles or trunks were removed for the analyses. Data presented for
    WP50 and WP88 were from distal branches (approximately 0.5-1.2 cm in diameter)
    of 1- to 3-year-old stems and therefore represent a conservative estimate of embolism
    resistance, as roots and leaves are normally less embolism resistant than stems
    within a species. All but 2% of the samples are from mature trees with 2% of samples
    coming from saplings or seedlings. PET data were extracted from the Global Aridity
    Index (Global-Aridity) and the Global Potential Evapo-Transpiration (Global-PET)
    Geospatial Database (http://www.cgiar-csi.org/2010/04/134/). The data set was
    then filtered for the target parameters. The data set was first filtered for samples
    in which both WP50 and WPmin were available, and filtered separately for WP50
    and MAP, which accounted for the majority of samples initially included. Only
    WP88 data for WPmin filtered species were included. Relationships between WP50
    and climate variables (MAP, aridity index, mean precipitation of the driest quarter)
    were analysed using a generalized model assessed by restricted maximum likelihood
    in which variance was simultaneously modelled as a power function of the same
    climate variables. Quantile regression was also used to assess the boundary relationship
    between WP50 and climate variables. As WP50 is a negative variable, the 10% quantile
    was used, which is equivalent to the 90% quantile for a positive response variable.
    WP50 and WPmin were collected from the same population of plants with the exception
    of a few cases in which WPmin data were extracted from another study or from unpublished
    sources. In 67% of our samples WPmin was measured as xylem or stem water potential,
    that is, the leaves were covered with plastic and aluminium foil such that leaf
    and stem water potentials were equilibrated. In the remaining 33% of cases WPmin
    was measured as leaf water potential. In this case, WPx may be less negative than
    leaf water potential because of the pressure drop across the leaf hydraulic pathway
    caused by transpiration. Because of the difference in leaf and xylem water potential
    it is possible the amount of embolism in the stem could be overestimated, that
    is, the safety margin would appear narrower than it actually was. However, there
    are two main reasons why this issue would not alter the results. First, WPmin
    has most probably been underestimated in most cases because we lack continuous
    long-term data sets of water potential. Second, 48% of the species for which leaf
    water potential was recorded were below -2.0 MPa. At this point the stomata are
    assumed to be closed in isohydric species (that is, species that close their stomata
    to prevent WPx from dropping) and thus leaf water potential would be close to
    equilibrium with stem water potential. To estimate the magnitude of any potential
    error, we correlated WPmin pre-dawn and WPmin midday for studies in which both
    were available. Although there is equilibrium for WPmin pre-dawn between leaves
    and stems, in theory there should be a more significant drop in WPmin midday for
    leaves than for stems. However, the slope of the relationship between WPmin midday
    and WPmin pre-dawn was statistically indistinguishable for leaves and stems, indicating
    that no bias was introduced by combining leaf and stem WPmin data (analysis of
    covariance (ANCOVA) interaction term, F1,112 = 0.944, P = 0.333).
