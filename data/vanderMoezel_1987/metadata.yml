  description: The study contains data on fire response, juvenile periods and flowering
    phenology of species in the Northern Sandplain shrublands of western Australia.
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: Twenty-six permanently marked 20 m x 10 m plots were established
    in Northern Sandplain shrublands near Badgingarra, Western Australia (30°16'S,
    115°26'E). The sites were representative of a range of topographic sites and ages-since-last-fire.
    Each site was initially categorized as lateritic upland or deep sand slope as
    these edaphic conditions have proved to produce the major floristic differences
    in the vegetation of this region (Bell and Loneragan 1985). The ages of more recently
    burned sites were determined by records of the Western Australian Bush Fire Board.
    Sites burned before 11 years ago could not be exactly documented and were grouped
    as >11 years. Each site was visited monthly from March 1981 till December 1981
    and a list of species in flower was compiled. Post-fire regeneration strategies
    were determined from recently burnt sites.

    description: Sites located near Badgingarra, Western Australia. Prior to European
      settlement, the region probably received fires on a cycle of some 25 years (Bell
      1985). Today fire frequencies are higher due to man-caused fires (Bell et al.
      1984) and a controlled-burning regime must be imposed on certain regions under
      management (Bell and Loneragan 1985).

  methods: Post-fire regeneration strategies were determined from recently burnt sites.
    Obligate seed regenerating species could be recognized because they initially
    have only a single erect stem. These seedlings were clearly differentiated from
    resprouting species which tend to be multi-stemmed. Geophytes were classed as
    sprouters since they regenerate after fire by producing new shoots from underground
    storage organs.

  methods: Post-fire regeneration strategies were determined from recently burnt sites.
    The time required for plants to reach reproductive maturity after fire was recorded
    for 108 species. Since all species were not present at every site, and sites of
    one and three years-since-last-fire were not available, the exact number of years
    to reach reproductive maturity could not be assigned to most species. Many species,
    therefore, were given values of <2, <4>2, etc. A value of <4>2 means that the
    species was seen flowering in a four-year-old site, was not seen flowering in
    a two-year-old site and was not recorded in a three-year-old site, so therefore
    it flowers within three or four years after a fire.

    Each site was visited monthly from March 1981 till December 1981 and a list of

    flowering times for those months were listed as no flowering; however, flowering
    may have been present.
