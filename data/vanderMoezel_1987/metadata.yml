  description: The study contains data on fire response, juvenile periods and flowering
    phenology of species in the Northern Sandplain shrublands of western Australia.
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: Twenty-six permanently marked 20 m x 10 m plots were established
    in Northern Sandplain shrublands near Badgingarra, Western Australia (30°16'S,
    115°26'E). The sites were representative of a range of topographic sites and ages-since-last-fire.
    Each site was initially categorized as lateritic upland or deep sand slope as 
    these edaphic conditions have proved to produce the major floristic differences
    in the vegetation of this region (Bell and Loneragan 1985). The ages of more recently
    burned sites were determined by records of the Western Australian Bush Fire Board.
    Sites burned before 11 years ago could not be exactly documented and were grouped
    as >11 years. Each site was visited monthly from March 1981 till December 1981
    and a list of species in flower was compiled. Post-fire regeneration strategies
    were determined from recently burnt sites.

    notes: Sites located near Badgingarra, Western Australia. Prior to European settlement,
      the region probably received fires on a cycle of some 25 years (Bell 1985). Today
      fire frequencies are higher due to man-caused fires (Bell et al. 1984) and a 
      controlled-burning regime must be imposed on certain regions under management
      (Bell and Loneragan 1985).
