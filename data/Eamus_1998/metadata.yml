  description: field campaigns of Derek Eamus via Ian Wright
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: The species chosen to represent the major evergreen and deciduous
    species and to complement previous studies (Myers et al. 1997, Prior et al. 1997a,
    Williams et al. 1997a, 1997b) were the two deciduous species Planchonia careya
    (F. Muell.) Knuth, Terminalia ferdinandiana and the two evergreen species Eucalytpus
    tetrodonta and E. miniata. The semi-deciduous species Syzygium suborbiculare (Benth.)
    Hartley and Perry was also measured in some cases. The study trees were between
    4 and 7 m in height.

  notes: Dark respiration rates were 10^6 too high. I went back to the manuscript to verify this was an error and corrected the data file. -- Lizzy Wenk The manuscript also includes the following traits not currently in Austraits -- ash content, lipid content, and heat of combustion
sites:
  Berrimah:
    latitude (deg): -12.4339
    longitude (deg): 130.9228
    rainfall (mm): 1600
    description: Vegetation is open forest (sensu Specht 1981) dominated by Eucalyptus
      tetrodonta F. Muell. and E. miniata A. Cunn. ex Schauer with sub-canopy dominants
      mostly comprised of Erythrophleum chlorystachys (F. Muell.) Baillon, Xanthostemum
      paradoxus F. Muell. and Terminalia ferdinandiana Excell. Perennial and some
      annual grasses (Sorghum, Chrysopogon, Ericahne spp. ) are present in the understory.
      Rainfall is about 1600 mm per annum, 90% of which falls in the wet season (December--March).
      Maximum/minimum temperatures are 31.8/24.8 °C in the wet season and 30.5/20.0
      °C in the dry season. Seasonal variations in microclimate and water relations
      of trees at a savanna site 25 km SE of this site have been described by Duff
      et al. (1997) and Myers et al. (1997).

  methods: Between four and seven replicate trees were sampled at each measurement
    time. Two or three individual branches of seven replicate trees of each species
    were tagged in September 1995 and weekly observations made for 4 months to identify
    new leaf flushes and to obtain estimates of leaf age for known populations of
    leaves in the canopy from that time onward.

  methods: Leaves were dried at 70 °C and ground to pass through a 2-mm mesh screen
    in a hammer mill (Retsch Gmblt 5657, Haan, West Germany) and then further ground
    with a mechanical mortar and pestle. Total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) was determined
    in duplicate 0.2-g samples by the micro-Kjeldahl method (AOAC 1990). Samples were
    digested with concentrated sulfuric acid at 390 °C for 2 h. Quantitative analyses
    were performed by flow injection analysis (QuikChem Method 13-07-06-2-D, Lachat
    Instruments, Milwaukee, WI).

- var_in: Amass (nmol/g/s)
  unit_in: nmolCO2/g/s
  trait_name: photosynthetic_rate_per_dry_mass
  value_type: site_mean
  replicates: 3 leaves on each of 7 individuals
  methods: Light-saturated assimilation rate (Amax) was measured with an LI-6200 portable
    photosynthesis unit (Li-Cor, Inc., Lincoln,NE). Three fully expanded, healthy
    leaves were selected from the upper canopy of each of seven trees for measurement
    in April 1996. All measurements were made in the morning during the late wet season
    when assimilation rate is maximal in this environment (Eamus and Cole 1997, Prior
    et al. 1997a, 1997b). Leaves were then dried at 70 °C and weighed.

    several additional similar leaves, were stored in damp plastic bags until transported
    to the laboratory (typically 2--4 h). Leaf area was determined with a leaf area
    meter (Delta-T Devices, Cambridge, U.K.).
