  description: field campaigns of Derek Eamus via Ian Wright
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: The species chosen to represent the major evergreen and deciduous
    species and to complement previous studies (Myers et al. 1997, Prior et al. 1997a,
    Williams et al. 1997a, 1997b) were the two deciduous species Planchonia careya
    (F. Muell.) Knuth, Terminalia ferdinandiana and the two evergreen species Eucalytpus
    tetrodonta and E. miniata. The semi-deciduous species Syzygium suborbiculare (Benth.)
    Hartley and Perry was also measured in some cases. The study trees were between
    4 and 7 m in height.

  notes: Dark respiration rates were 10^6 too high. I went back to the manuscript
    to verify this was an error and corrected the data file. Lizzy Wenk

    description: Vegetation is open forest (sensu Specht 1981) dominated by Eucalyptus
      tetrodonta F. Muell. and E. miniata A. Cunn. ex Schauer with sub-canopy dominants
      mostly comprised of Erythrophleum chlorystachys (F. Muell.) Baillon, Xanthostemum
      paradoxus F. Muell. and Terminalia ferdinandiana Excell. Perennial and some
      annual grasses (Sorghum, Chrysopogon, Ericahne spp.) are present in the understory.
      Rainfall is about 1600 mm per annum, 90% of which falls in the wet season (December-March).
      Maximum/minimum temperatures are 31.8/24.8 deg C in the wet season and 30.5/20.0
      deg C in the dry season. Seasonal variations in microclimate and water relations
      of trees at a savanna site 25 km SE of this site have been described by Duff
      et al. (1997) and Myers et al. (1997).

  unit_in: months
  trait_name: leaf_lifespan
  value_type: site_mean
  replicates: 4-7
  methods: Between four and seven replicate trees were sampled at each measurement
    time. Two or three individual branches of seven replicate trees of each species
    were tagged in September 1995 and weekly observations made for 4 months to identify
    new leaf flushes and to obtain estimates of leaf age for known populations of
    leaves in the canopy from that time onward.

  unit_in: nmolCO2/g/s
  trait_name: photosynthetic_rate_per_dry_mass_saturated
  value_type: site_mean
  replicates: 3 leaves on each of 7 individuals
  methods: Light-saturated assimilation rate (Amax) was measured with an LI-6200 portable
    photosynthesis unit (Li-Cor, Inc., Lincoln,NE). Three fully expanded, healthy
    leaves were selected from the upper canopy of each of seven trees for measurement
    in April 1996. All measurements were made in the morning during the late wet season
    when assimilation rate is maximal in this environment (Eamus and Cole 1997, Prior
    et al. 1997a, 1997b). Leaves were then dried at 70 deg C and weighed.

    to the laboratory (typically 2--4 h). Leaf area was determined with a leaf area
    meter (Delta-T Devices, Cambridge, U.K.).

    the heat of combustion on a total dry weight basis to the corresponding ash-free
    weight.
