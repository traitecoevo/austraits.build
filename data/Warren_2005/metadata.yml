  description: An investigation of adaptation of leaf morphology and physiology of
    Eucalyptus sideroxylon subsp. tricarpa to rainfall in a common garden experiment.
  collection_type: common_garden
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: Seed collection and the common garden site The common garden
    experiment included 15 populations grown under uniform conditions. Seed had been
    collected from sites spanning the natural range of red ironbark (Table 1) and
    separated from each other by more than 20 km. At each site, seed was collected
    by shotgun from one healthy dominant tree, as described elsewhere (Stackpole and
    Tibbits 2001 and CSIRO Australian Tree Seed Centre, www.ffp.csiro.au/tigr/ atscmain/).We
    obtained long-term climate data from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (www.bom.gov.au/climate/averages/)
    for each seed collection site. The common garden experiment was established in
    the goldfields area of central Victoria, Australia (36.62 deg S, 144.30 deg E,
    175 m a.s.l.). The site is located on ex-pasture land with a north to north easterly
    aspect of less than 4 deg. The soil has a gradational profile, from reddish-brown
    loam with ironstone (the top 20 cm), to orange-brown medium clay (20 to 80 cm),
    to greyer mottled clays (up to a depth of 80 to 150 cm or more). The closest meteorological
    station with long-term climatic records is Bendigo Prison (Australian Bureau of
    Meteorology, Site No. 081003, 36.75 deg S, 144.28 deg E). In July (midwinter),
    mean daily minimum and maximum temperatures are 3.5 and 12.1 deg C, respectively.
    In January (midsummer), mean daily minimum and maximum temperatures are 14.3 and
    28.9 deg C, respectively. Mean annual point potential evapotranspiration (Morton
    1983) for this area is between 1400 and 1600 mm. Mean annual rainfall is 550 mm
    year -1. However, measurements were made in the spring of 2003 when rainfall for
    the preceding 12 months had been only 80% of the long-term mean. In mid-June of
    2000, the site was ripped to a depth of 60 cm with a winged ripper. Rip lines
    were subsequently bedded with a mound-plough, giving rise to 20-cm mounds. Seedlings
    were planted on September 25 and 26, 2000, with five trees per row, at a spacing
    of 4.0 (between rows) to 1.8 m. Measurements were made in spring 2003 when the
    soil was at field capacity and trees were 3 years old, had adult foliage and were
    between 1.5 and 3 m tall.

  methods: The maximum rate of light-saturated photosynthesis (Amax) was measured
    on five trees per population over two warm (about 15 to 20 deg C maximum) cloudless
    days in spring 2003. Two measurements were made per tree and averaged. Populations
    were measured in random order throughout the 2 days to avoid confounding population
    with diurnal effects. surements were made on the youngest fully expanded foliage
    from the north (sunlit) side of the tree. Measurements were made with an open,
    infra-red gas analyzer (LI-6400, Li-Cor, Lincoln, NE) at 360 to 370 umol mol-1
    CO2, 20 deg C leaf temperature, 1500 umol m-2 s-1 photosynthetic photon flux (PPF),
    and a leaf-to-air vapor pressure deficit of 1.0-1.3 kPa. Initial experiments established
    that this PPF was above the light-saturation point of red ironbark. Photosynthesis,
    transpiration and intercellular carbon dioxide concentration (Ci) were allowed
    to stabilize before measurements were taken. Additional measurements were made
    on five nearby (~250 m distant) trees of the Bodalla population because initial
    measurements indicated that the Bodalla population included in the common garden
    had a much lower Amax than the other populations. However, the Amax of the adjacent
    population was also low (t test, P > 0.1), confirming that a low Amax is characteristic
    of this population. Immediately following measurement of photosynthesis, five
    leaves per tree were collected for subsequent morphological measurements and chemical
    analyses.
