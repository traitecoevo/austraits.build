  description: A survey of rainforest tree communities across the Australian subtropics
    (spanning 600 to 2500 mm rainfall year-1), including the measurement of functional
    traits on 285 (91%) of all recorded species.
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: 2.1 Study System ^p This study was undertaken in subtropical
    rainforest and dry forest between Ballina in New South Wales (NSW) and Gladstone
    in Queensland, Australia (Figure S1). At the time of European colonisation, rainforest
    and dry forest was patchily distributed throughout the subtropics of Australia
    within a matrix of pyric vegetation (Figure S1) that was actively managed by the
    region's Indigenous Peoples using fire for thousands of years (Fensham and Fairfax
    1996; Butler et al. 2014). Emerging evidence indicates that culturally important
    rainforest tree species were also translocated by Indigenous Peoples (Rossetto
    et al. 2017; Fahey et al. 2024), though the proportion of potentially translocated
    species in each rainforest or dry forest assemblage is likely to be small. Remaining
    rainforests and dry forests form distinct assemblages across topographic (Laidlaw
    et al. 2016) and regional (Shapcott et al. 2017) climate gradients and have been
    classified into sub-formations (Table S1) based on physiognomy (Webb 1959; Queensland
    Herbarium 2023). ^p 2.2 Survey Design and Methodology ^p From February 2021 to
    July 2023, we surveyed 40 forest tree communities (i.e., sites), distributed across
    the region's major climate gradients and combined these with five sites surveyed
    previously at the Bunya Mountains using the same methodology (Brown et al. 2022)
    (Figure S1). Sampled communities were located on soils derived from basalt or
    granite (Wilson and Taylor 2012), the most widespread substrates that support
    rainforests and dry forests in the region. Within each site, four 25 x 25 m plots
    were established across 1-2 ha of homogeneous forest, and the stem diameter (DBH)
    and species identity of all self-supporting woody individuals ≥ 3 cm were recorded.
    We avoided large canopy gaps and areas with signs of historical logging to capture
    climax assemblages across the region. ^p 2.5 Trait Sampling and Measurement ^p
    We measured morphological and anatomical traits that are well-understood proxies
    for direct physiological processes of tree hydraulic and light utilisation strategies
    (Table 1). Between 2019 and 2023 we sampled individuals from multiple locations
    per species to enable robust estimates of species-level means (refer to Table
    S3 for sample sizes by trait and species). Sampling in the field focused on north-facing
    forest edges where sun-exposed branches of mature individuals were accessible
    using telescopic pole pruners for most species including many obligate understory
    species. We also opportunistically sampled sun-exposed branches from healthy,
    mature cultivated individuals. Trait values measured on cultivated individuals
    did not differ systematically from naturally occurring individuals (Table S4).

  methods: We used microscopy on petioles to measure average xylem vessel lumen diameter
    (lumen breadth; b) and vessel wall thickness (t) to describe hydraulic efficiency
    and vessel reinforcement, respectively (Blackman et al. 2018). Petioles were collected
    from an average of three individuals per species. Sections were made at 10 um
    thickness using a cryostat (CryoStar NX70, Thermo Fisher Scientific), then stained
    with 0.1% toluidine blue in 1% sodium acetate buffer solution and mounted with
    coverslips. While replicate petioles were sampled from most individual plants,
    we selected the best quality section per individual for measurement (Table S3).
    Using a light microscope at 40x magnification, three distinct bundles of five
    xylem vessels were identified for each section, with vessel wall thickness and
    lumen diameter measured in ImageJ (Schneider, Rasband, and Eliceiri 2012). For
    each vessel, lumen breadth was calculated as the average of the widest and narrowest
    diameters, and vessel wall thickness (t) was calculated as the average of three
    measurements for each vessel wall. Refer to Supporting Information and Figure
    S3 for further details.

  methods: A single branch (5-7 cm long, 2-7 cm diameter) was sampled from an average
    of three individuals per species (Table S3) to measure wood density (dry mass/fresh
    volume; g cm-3). After removing the bark, fresh volume was measured via water
    displacement and dry mass was measured after samples were dried for 3 days at
    105°C (Williamson and Wiemann 2010).

  methods: A sunlit branch was collected from an average of four individuals per species
    (Table S3). To prevent desiccation, cut branches were stored in wet plastic bags
    during transport to the laboratory. To rehydrate leaves, branches were recut in
    deionised water and covered with a black plastic bag until the following day.
    Four undamaged, fully expanded leaves were selected from each branch following
    rehydration and weighed with an analytical balance (GR-200, A&D Company Ltd.,
    Tokyo, Japan) to obtain fresh mass, then scanned through a leaf area meter (LI-3100C
    Area Meter, LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, USA) to measure lamina area. For compound
    leaves, at least half of the leaflets were selected per leaf, and measurements
    were performed on individual leaflets. After drying leaves at 70°C for 3 days,
    specific leaf area (SLA; lamina area/dry mass; mm2/mg) and leaf dry matter content
    (LDMC; dry mass/fresh mass; proportion) were calculated for each individual leaf
    or leaflet (Perez-Harguindeguy et al. 2013).
