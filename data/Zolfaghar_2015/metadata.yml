  description: A study seeking to to determine how depth-to-groundwater (DGW) impacts
    on leaf water relations, leaf structure and branch xylem vulnerability to embolism
    in a mesic environment.
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: This study was conducted between January 2010 and December 2012
    at six sites located in remnant native Eucalyptus woodland within the Kangaloon
    bore-field in the Upper Nepean catchment, 110 km south-west of Sydney, New South
    Wales, Australia (between 34°29'S 150°34'E and 34°32'S 150°37'E). All sites have
    been protected from logging since their declaration as 'protected areas' in the
    1920s. Six sites were chosen along an 11 km transect to span a range of average
    DGW, 2.4, 4.3, 9.8, 13, 16.3 and 37.5 m. Depth-to-groundwater in this area has
    been monitored by the Sydney Catchment Authority (SCA) on a daily basis since
    2006 and average DGW was estimated using this data set. Average DGW fluctuated
    minimally (<10%) across all sites during the past 6 years. There were four dominant
    species across all sites, Eucalyptus piperita Sm., E. globoidea Blakely, E. sieberi
    L.A.S.Johnson and E. sclerophylla (Blakely) L.A.S.Johnson & Blaxell (Table 1).
    The dominant tree species were defined as those that, when summed at a site, accounted
    for >80% of total tree standing basal area. During 2000-10, the study area received
    an annual average rainfall of 1067 mm (BOM station no. 68243, http://www.bom.gov.au/).
    However, rainfall in 2011 and 2012 was 1561 and 1188 mm, respectively (46 and
    11% above average). The largest average monthly rainfall occurs in February (186
    mm) and the smallest in August (51 mm). Average minimum temperature occurs in
    July (2.7°C) and average maximum temperature in January (24.3°C) (2000-12).

  methods: Pressure-volume analyses were used to assess leaf water relations during
    late summer (February and early March) and late winter (August). Within each site
    three trees per species were selected and three terminal branches (from the upper
    canopy, 10-15 m height, depending on tree height) were excised (leaves attached)
    and immediately re-cut under water to remove any air emboli. The newly re-cut
    end of the branch was placed in water and the entire branch-and-leaves covered
    in black plastic bags to facilitate full rehydration. Following overnight rehydration
    one mature fully expanded leaf per branch was excised and its fresh weight measured
    using a digital balance (0.001 g resolution). The leaf was allowed to lose a small
    amount of weight through transpiration and its water potential was measured using
    a Scholander-type pressure chamber (Model 3000, Soil Moisture Equipment Corp.,
    Santa Barbara, CA, USA). This process was repeated several times until at least
    five points were obtained on the linear part of the type II transform (i.e., five
    points beyond the point at which zero turgor was attained). Pressure-volume curves
    were established by plotting the inverse of leaf water potential (-1/psi) of each
    sample vs relative water content (RWC) (pressure-volume curve type II) following
    Eamus et al. (2006). The projected area of each leaf was measured using a leaf
    area meter (WinDAS 3.1), and leaf dry weight determined after oven drying at 65
    °C for 72 h. Leaf RWC was calculated; see manuscript for the equation. From the
    pressure-volume curve, leaf water potential at turgor loss point (psi-TLP), RWC
    at turgor loss point (RWCTLP), osmotic potential at full turgor and modulus of
    elasticity were calculated according to the method of Bartlett et al. (2012).

  methods: Branch xylem vulnerability to embolism was determined for terminal branches
    from all four species across four sites, 2.4, 4.3, 9.8 and 37.5 m DGW. Maximum
    vessel length of all species at each site was measured following Macinnis-Ng et
    al. (2004) and all branches used for vulnerability testing were at least 10% longer
    than the longest vessel length recorded for each species. Measurements were made
    on three trees per species. Embolism was induced using the bench de-hydration
    method in summer (December-February) and air injection method in winter (June-August).
    The change in method occurred because the air injection system is much faster
    and provides more precise control of water potentials than the branch drying method
    but the air injection system was not available in the summer. Xylem vulnerability
    curves and P50 values did not differ across the two methods of assessment (data
    not shown). ^p The bench de-hydration method of Prior and Eamus (1999) was applied
    to terminal branches (between 40-70 cm length and 3-6 mm diameter) by allowing
    excised branches to de-hydrate in air for various time periods. After allowing
    time for partial de-hydration, water potential of two leaves on the same branch
    was measured using a pressure chamber (Model 3000, Soil Moisture Equipment Corp.).
    Following this, and prior to measuring xylem hydraulic conductance, both ends
    of the branches were trimmed and all leaves removed under water using a sharp
    razor blade. Leaf scars were then sealed using glue and parafilm to prevent flow
    through them. Hydraulic conductance was then measured using two custom made vacuum
    chambers by measuring the rate of flow of acidified, filtered and de-gassed water
    through the branch at four pressures (20, 30, 40 and 50 kPa). After measuring
    the initial conductance, maximum conductance of the branch was measured after
    flushing each branch with acidified, filtered and de-gassed water at an applied
    pressure of 175 kPa for 30 min.  ^p The air injection method used a commercially
    available Digital Cavitation Chamber Instrument (Model 1505D-EXP, PMS Instrument
    Company, Albany, OR, USA). In the air-injection method, terminal branches were
    inserted into the cavitation chambers after all leaves had been excised and leaf
    scars sealed with glue and parafilm. The bark at the central part of branch (where
    it was inserted into the cavitation chambers) was removed and the sapwood was
    lightly notched using sharp blade to facilitate air injection into the xylem.
    Branches were flushed with acidified, filtered and de-gassed water at a pressure
    of 175 kPa for 30 min to remove air bubbles from embolized vessels. Maximum hydraulic
    conductance of the branch was measured by measuring the rate of flow of solution
    through the sapwood induced by positive pressure. Cavitation was then induced
    by increasing the air pressure inside the chamber for 5 min. After releasing the
    pressure inside the chambers, hydraulic conductance was re-measured. This process
    was repeated using increasing pressures within the chamber until 90% of maximum
    conductance had been lost due to embolism. Having measured the maximum and initial
    conductance in both methods, percentage loss in conductance (PLC) was calculated
    as (Froend and Drake 2006), PLC=kmax-kkmax x 100,(2)where kmax is the maximal
    conductance of the branch. Vulnerability curves were generated by plotting percentage
    PLC against the corresponding water potential (psi-x). Data were fitted to an
    exponential-sigmoidal function to find P50 (Eq. (3)), PLC=100(1+exp[a(Y-b)]),(3)
    where a is the gradient of the linear transformation, b is constant and psi is
    the branch water potential.

  methods: Two sapwood samples were extracted (at a height of 1.3 m) from the stem
    of five trees per species from each site, using increment corers. Immediately
    after collection samples were sealed in plastic straws and returned to the laboratory
    in a cooler. Once in the laboratory each core was placed in water for half an
    hour to ensure full hydration. After removal from water, branches were surface
    dried and their fresh volume measured following method described by (Ilic 2000).
    The samples were then oven dried and the dry mass measured. Sapwood density (g
    cm-3) was calculated as the ratio of dry weigh versus fresh volume.
