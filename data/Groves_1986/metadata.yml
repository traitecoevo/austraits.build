  description: In this study we compared the distribution patterns of biomass, nitrogen,
    phosphorus and other nutrients in vegetative and reproductive organs in two species
    of Banksia (Proteaceae), Banksia marginata Cav. and Banksia ornata F. Muell.,
    at different times after fire.

  sampling_strategy: The study sites represented an age sequence since fire of 1,
    6, 11, 16, 25, 38 and 50+ years (Gill and McMahon 1986). Site selection for stands
    younger than 25 years was based on several replicates and a knowledge of the fire
    history of the region (McMahon 1984b). For each age stand of B. ornata, the heights
    of the first 30 plants along a line transect (Gill and McMahon 1986) were measured
    and the numbers of inflorescences (flowers) and cones on each plant counted. These
    values were averaged and the two plants which most closely approximated the mean
    plant in height and numbers of flowers and cones in each stand were cut off at
    ground level. Only one plant was sampled from each of the 38 and 50t year stands
    because of their large size (about 2 m high). In the 50+ year stand there were
    plants of B. ornata which had senesced completely and were thus unsuitable for
    biomass sampling; others,were still growing actively. For practicality, we compromised
    by selecting one plant intermediate between these two extreme conditions. Plants
    of B. marginata were sampled from the same sites as B. ornata. Only the depauperate
    heathland form of B. marginata occurred at these sites, and mature 25 year plants
    were abont 1.5 m high. Two representative plants were selected visually from each
    stand up to 11 years after fire and one from each of the 16 and 25 year stands,
    as the density of B. marginata was low at these sites. There were no B. marginata
    plants in the 38 or 50+ year vegetation. Extra cones of each species were collected
    from each site to provide enough seeds for chemical analyses. Plant samples were
    separated as soon as possible into the following parts- dead and living stems
    and leaves, young stems and leaves of the current season's growth, flowers and
    cones. Each organ was dried at 80Â°C in a forced-draught dehydrator for at least
    3 days and weighed.

    description: The study sites were in heathland dominated by Banksia ornata and
      Casuarina spp.. All sites were in or adjacent to the Little Desert National
      Park, near Nhill in western Victoria. These infertile soils form extensive tracts
      of undulating sandplain in the Little Desert area of western Victoria. All sites
      were situated within the 80-160 m a.s.1. contours, and were either flat or gently
      sloping, thereby minimising aspect differences. The climate of the area conforms
      to the summer dry-winter wet Csb type (Dick 1975).
    precipitation, MAP (mm): 400-430
    soil: The soils at the sites are deep infertile bleached sands with a ferruginous
      B horizon and have a principal form Uc 2.21 (Northcote et al. 1975).

  methods: Dried plant samples (except for seeds) were ground in a Wiley laboratory
    mill to pass a 20-mesh (0.84 mm) screen. Bulky material was subsampled before
    being ground. Subsamples (300 mg) of the plant powders were digested in duplicate
    by a Kjeldahl method with 0.5% selenium as a catalyst and salicylic acid to reduce
    any nitrate-nitrogen present so that total nitrogen could be measured (Eastln
    1978). For seeds, two subsamples each of 10 seeds (including wings) were digested
    for each age category. Concentrations of total nitrogen and total phosphorus were
    determined from the digests with an autoanalyser, using the indophenol blue method
    for nitrogen and the vanadomolybdate method for phosphorus. Concentrations of
    the major cations (potassium, calcium, magnesium and sodium) were determined from
    the Kjeldahl digests by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. For the micronutrients
    iron, zinc, manganese and copper, subsamples (usually 1 g) of plant material were
    digested in duplicate in a mixture of nitric and perchloric acids, and concentrations
    in the diluted digests were determined by atomic absorption spectrometry. Total
    sulfur in vegetative organs was determined by X-ray fluorescent spectroscopy (Norrish
    and Hutton 1977). Seeds were ground in a mortar and pestle, and subsamples (300
    mg) were wet-ashed; total sulfur in these digests was determined turbidimetrically
    (Sansum and Robinson 1974). Reference material (US. National Bureau of Standards
    1571 or 1572) was included every 40 samples to check digestion and analytical
    procedures.

    for nitrogen and the vanadomolybdate method for phosphorus. Concentrations of
    the major cations (potassium, calcium, magnesium and sodium) were determined from
    the Kjeldahl digests by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. For the micronutrients
    iron, zinc, manganese and copper, subsamples (usually 1 g) of plant material were
    digested in duplicate in a mixture of nitric and perchloric acids, and concentrations
    in the diluted digests were determined by atomic absorption spectrometry. Total
    sulfur in vegetative organs was determined by X-ray fluorescent spectroscopy (Norrish

  methods: Dried plant samples (except for seeds) were ground in a Wiley laboratory
    mill to pass a 20-mesh (0.84 mm) screen. Bulky material was subsampled before
    being ground. Subsamples (300 mg) of the plant powders were digested in duplicate
    by a Kjeldahl method with 0.5% selenium as a catalyst and salicylic acid to reduce
    any nitrate-nitrogen present so that total nitrogen could be measured (Eastln
    1978). For seeds, two subsamples each of 10 seeds (including wings) were digested
    for each age category. Concentrations of total nitrogen and total phosphorus were
    determined from the digests with an autoanalyser, using the indophenol blue method
    for nitrogen and the vanadomolybdate method for phosphorus. Concentrations of
    the major cations (potassium, calcium, magnesium and sodium) were determined from
    the Kjeldahl digests by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. For the micronutrients
    iron, zinc, manganese and copper, subsamples (usually 1 g) of plant material were
    digested in duplicate in a mixture of nitric and perchloric acids, and concentrations
    in the diluted digests were determined by atomic absorption spectrometry. Total
    sulfur in vegetative organs was determined by X-ray fluorescent spectroscopy (Norrish
    and Hutton 1977). Seeds were ground in a mortar and pestle, and subsamples (300
    mg) were wet-ashed; total sulfur in these digests was determined turbidimetrically
    (Sansum and Robinson 1974). Reference material (US. National Bureau of Standards
    1571 or 1572) was included every 40 samples to check digestion and analytical

  methods: Dried plant samples (except for seeds) were ground in a Wiley laboratory
    mill to pass a 20-mesh (0.84 mm) screen. Bulky material was subsampled before
    being ground. Subsamples (300 mg) of the plant powders were digested in duplicate
    by a Kjeldahl method with 0.5% selenium as a catalyst and salicylic acid to reduce
    any nitrate-nitrogen present so that total nitrogen could be measured (Eastln
    1978). For seeds, two subsamples each of 10 seeds (including wings) were digested
    for each age category. Concentrations of total nitrogen and total phosphorus were
    determined from the digests with an autoanalyser, using the indophenol blue method
    for nitrogen and the vanadomolybdate method for phosphorus. Concentrations of
    the major cations (potassium, calcium, magnesium and sodium) were determined from
    the Kjeldahl digests by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. For the micronutrients
    iron, zinc, manganese and copper, subsamples (usually 1 g) of plant material were
    digested in duplicate in a mixture of nitric and perchloric acids, and concentrations
    in the diluted digests were determined by atomic absorption spectrometry. Total
    sulfur in vegetative organs was determined by X-ray fluorescent spectroscopy (Norrish
    and Hutton 1977). Seeds were ground in a mortar and pestle, and subsamples (300
    mg) were wet-ashed; total sulfur in these digests was determined turbidimetrically
    (Sansum and Robinson 1974). Reference material (US. National Bureau of Standards
    1571 or 1572) was included every 40 samples to check digestion and analytical
    procedures.

  methods: Dried plant samples (except for seeds) were ground in a Wiley laboratory
    mill to pass a 20-mesh (0.84 mm) screen. Bulky material was subsampled before
    being ground. Subsamples (300 mg) of the plant powders were digested in duplicate
    by a Kjeldahl method with 0.5% selenium as a catalyst and salicylic acid to reduce
    any nitrate-nitrogen present so that total nitrogen could be measured (Eastln
    1978). For seeds, two subsamples each of 10 seeds (including wings) were digested
    for each age category. Concentrations of total nitrogen and total phosphorus were
    determined from the digests with an autoanalyser, using the indophenol blue method
    for nitrogen and the vanadomolybdate method for phosphorus. Concentrations of
    the major cations (potassium, calcium, magnesium and sodium) were determined from
    the Kjeldahl digests by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. For the micronutrients
    iron, zinc, manganese and copper, subsamples (usually 1 g) of plant material were
    digested in duplicate in a mixture of nitric and perchloric acids, and concentrations
    in the diluted digests were determined by atomic absorption spectrometry. Total

  methods: Dried plant samples (except for seeds) were ground in a Wiley laboratory
    mill to pass a 20-mesh (0.84 mm) screen. Bulky material was subsampled before
    being ground. Subsamples (300 mg) of the plant powders were digested in duplicate
    by a Kjeldahl method with 0.5% selenium as a catalyst and salicylic acid to reduce
    any nitrate-nitrogen present so that total nitrogen could be measured (Eastln
    1978). For seeds, two subsamples each of 10 seeds (including wings) were digested
    for each age category. Concentrations of total nitrogen and total phosphorus were
    determined from the digests with an autoanalyser, using the indophenol blue method
    for nitrogen and the vanadomolybdate method for phosphorus. Concentrations of
    the major cations (potassium, calcium, magnesium and sodium) were determined from
    the Kjeldahl digests by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. For the micronutrients
    iron, zinc, manganese and copper, subsamples (usually 1 g) of plant material were
    digested in duplicate in a mixture of nitric and perchloric acids, and concentrations
    in the diluted digests were determined by atomic absorption spectrometry. Total
    sulfur in vegetative organs was determined by X-ray fluorescent spectroscopy (Norrish

    and Hutton 1977). Seeds were ground in a mortar and pestle, and subsamples (300
    mg) were wet-ashed; total sulfur in these digests was determined turbidimetrically
    (Sansum and Robinson 1974). Reference material (US. National Bureau of Standards
    1571 or 1572) was included every 40 samples to check digestion and analytical
    procedures.

  methods: Dried plant samples (except for seeds) were ground in a Wiley laboratory
    mill to pass a 20-mesh (0.84 mm) screen. Bulky material was subsampled before
    being ground. Subsamples (300 mg) of the plant powders were digested in duplicate
    by a Kjeldahl method with 0.5% selenium as a catalyst and salicylic acid to reduce
    any nitrate-nitrogen present so that total nitrogen could be measured (Eastln
    1978). For seeds, two subsamples each of 10 seeds (including wings) were digested
    for each age category. Concentrations of total nitrogen and total phosphorus were
    determined from the digests with an autoanalyser, using the indophenol blue method
    for nitrogen and the vanadomolybdate method for phosphorus. Concentrations of
    the major cations (potassium, calcium, magnesium and sodium) were determined from
    the Kjeldahl digests by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. For the micronutrients
    iron, zinc, manganese and copper, subsamples (usually 1 g) of plant material were
    digested in duplicate in a mixture of nitric and perchloric acids, and concentrations
    in the diluted digests were determined by atomic absorption spectrometry. Total
    sulfur in vegetative organs was determined by X-ray fluorescent spectroscopy (Norrish
    and Hutton 1977). Seeds were ground in a mortar and pestle, and subsamples (300
    mg) were wet-ashed; total sulfur in these digests was determined turbidimetrically
    (Sansum and Robinson 1974). Reference material (US. National Bureau of Standards
    1571 or 1572) was included every 40 samples to check digestion and analytical
    procedures.
