  description: leaf traits for scleorphyllous species in Harrison (2009)
  life_stage: seedling, adult
  basis_of_record: field lab
  sampling_strategy: 'Morphological and physiological measurements were obtained from
    two independent investigations: a field study comparing species pairs from eight
    genera and a greenhouse experiment that examined seven species of the genus Eucalyptus.
    A field study was conducted using two C3 species from each of eight perennial
    Australian evergreen genera growing in the ANBG, Canberra (35deg12''S, 149deg04''E).
    The genera were selected so as to provide a wide range of LMA, and thus included
    a variety of growth forms including vines, shrubs and trees (Table 1). The greenhouse
    study was conducted at the Australian National University, Canberra, using 12-month-old
    seedlings of Eucalyptus bridgesiana, Eucalyptus elata, Eucalyptus mannifera, Eucalyptus
    moorei, Eucalyptus pauciflora, Eucalyptus polyanthemos and Eucalyptus rossii,which
    were purchased from theYarralumla Nursery (Canberra). At the nursery, seedlings
    were grown in potting mix that contained a controlled-release fertilizer (18%
    nitrogen), applied at a rate of 3 kg m-3.All species were grown in full sunlight
    on the same site. Seedlings were transplanted from nursery tubes into large plastic
    pots (180 x 180 x 240 mm3; length x width x depth) filled with a sterilized sand/peat/perlite
    mixture on 1 May 2006. Growth conditions and experimental design of the greenhouse
    study Five blocks containing 14 eucalypts were arranged in the greenhouse, with
    each block containing two replicates of each species. Greenhouses were maintained
    at 22-25 deg C during the day and 15-18 deg C at night. Supplementary lighting
    [280 mmol photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) photons m-2 s-1] was provided
    by six 150 W flood lamps between 0500-1000 and 1700-2100 h in order to extend
    day length. Midday PAR measured with a quantum light sensor (Li-Cor Inc., Lincoln,
    NE, USA) averaged 500 mmol PAR photons m-2 s-1 on sunny days. Seedlings were watered
    to field capacity, twice daily. Rorison''s nutrient solution (Hewitt 1966) was
    applied twice per week to each seedling, 100 mL from 1 May to 16 June, and 625
    mL from 17 June to 1 July, to increase the size and growth rate of young leaves.
    For five of the replicates of each species, one per block, the 4 mm Ca(NO3)2 in
    the Rorison''s solution was replaced with 4 mm CaCl2, providing plus- and minus-nitrogen
    treatments, respectively. To distinguish between new and pre-existing leaves,
    white tags were attached to the youngest petiole on the main stem prior to the
    start of the experiment. Seedlings were periodically sprayed with chemicals for
    control of psyllids and powdery mildew.'

    description: Photosynthetic rate adjusted using the model developed by Farquhar,von
      Caemmerer & Berry (1980). The model was used to scale all Aa measurements to
      a common intercellular CO2 partial pressure (Ci) of 300 umol mol-1 (Aa300).This
      approach was carried out using Eqn 1 in manuscript, assuming the in vivo maximum
      carboxylation activity of Rubisco per unit area (Vcmax) was limiting photosynthesis
      (Aa). The kinetic constants of Rubisco (Kc and Ko, the Michaelis-Menten constants
      for CO2 and O2, respectively, and G, the CO2 compensation point in the absence
      of dark respiration, Rd) were adopted from von Caemmerer et al. (1994) assuming
      infinite internal conductance, with their temperature dependence functions given
      in von Caemmerer (2000).Rd was assumed to be 0.1 of Aa for the ANBG data.These
      assumptions were validated from CO2 response curves measured on the eucalypt
      leaves (data not shown).

  methods: When gas exchange measurements were completed each day, leaves were detached
    and the segment used for measurement of photosynthesis was cut out and weighed.
    The segment area was determined using a leaf area meter (Li-Cor L3100, Li-Cor
    Inc.). All ANBG leaf segments were dried for a minimum of 48 h at 80 deg C then
    reweighed, allowing calculation of leaf dry mass per unit area (LMA).

  methods: All dried leaves were ground separately in a ball mill. The nitrogen concentration
    of the photosynthetic segment was assayed using an elemental analyser (EA 1110
    CHNO; Carlo-Erba Instruments, Milan, Italy) with a typical machine precision of
    0.02% N. Approximately 1.2 mg of each segment was analysed.

  methods: A protocol was adapted from Lamport (1965) and Onoda et al. (2004) to remove
    soluble protein from the milled leaf material. Approximately 10 mg of freeze-dried
    leaf was extracted in 1.5 mL of buffer (50 mm tricine, pH 8.1) containing 1% PVP40
    (average molecular weight 40 000,product no. 1407; Sigma Chemical Company, St
    Louis,MO, USA). The sample was vortexed, centrifuged at 12 000 g for 5 min (Eppendorf
    AG 5424, Hamburg, Germany) and the supernatant was carefully removed. The pellet
    was resuspended in buffer without PVP containing 1% sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS),
    incubated at 90 deg C for 5 min, then centrifuged at 12 000 g for 5 min. This
    was repeated, and then two washes with 0.2 m KOH, two washes with deionized water
    and finally two washes with ethanol were carried out. The tube containing the
    pellet was then oven-dried at 80 deg C. The remaining dry mass of pellet was assumed
    to represent the leaf structural biomass, and the N content was determined on
    2-5 mg of material using the elemental analyser as above.

  replicates: 4-5
  methods: A duplicate set of leaves, matching those used for photosynthesis measurements,
    was sampled   for cell wall nitrogen measurement, being snap-frozen in liquid
    nitrogen, then stored at -80 deg C until used. Leaves were then freeze-dried at
    -45 deg C, 64 mT for at least 3 d, using a Microprocessor Controlled Bench-Top
    Lyophilizer (FTS Systems, Inc., Stone Ridge, NY, USA). All sampled greenhouse
    eucalypt leaf segments were freeze-dried.A protocol was adapted from Lamport (1965)
    and Onoda et al. (2004) to remove soluble protein from the milled leaf material.
    Approximately 10 mg of freeze-dried leaf was extracted in 1.5 mL of buffer (50
    mm tricine, pH 8.1) containing 1% PVP40 (average molecular weight 40 000,product
    no. 1407; Sigma Chemical Company, St Louis,MO, USA). The sample was vortexed,
    centrifuged at 12 000 g for 5 min (Eppendorf AG 5424, Hamburg, Germany) and the
    supernatant was carefully removed. The pellet was resuspended in buffer without
    PVP containing 1% sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS), incubated at 90 deg C for 5 min,
    then centrifuged at 12 000 g for 5 min. This was repeated, and then two washes
    with 0.2 m KOH, two washes with deionized water and finally two washes with ethanol
    were carried out. The tube containing the pellet was then oven-dried at 80 deg
    C. The remaining dry mass of pellet was assumed to represent the leaf structural
    biomass, and the N content was determined on 2-5 mg of material using the elemental
    analyser as above. 'The fraction of leaf nitrogen in cell wall material,NCW/NL,
    was calculated using Eqn 2 where the fraction of cell wall material (MCW) recovered
    from the total leaf biomass (ML) was multiplied by the nitrogen concentration
    of cell wall material (NCW/MCW) divided by the leaf nitrogen concentration (NL/ML).
    Attempts were made to extract Rubisco for several of the species using the method
    which has routinely been used for Nicotiana tabacum (Mate et al. 1993).We tried
    to grind fresh leaves, or leaves frozen in liquid N2, using mortar and pestle,
    a Ten Broeck homogenizer or a Polytron, and we also tried to extract freeze-dried
    leaf material that was ball milled. None of our attempts yielded adequate soluble
    protein or Rubisco, presumably because we were unable to successfully rupture
    the mesophyll cells.

  method_context: infrared gas analyser
  methods: Measurements of CO2 assimilation rate per unit area (Aa) in the ANBG were
    made at saturating irradiance (Table 1), which was determined for each species
    by first measuring a light response curve. Measurements were made on leaves for
    all species except Acacia, where phyllodes were used, from 28 March 2006 to 24
    April 2006, using an infrared gas analyser (IRGA) (LI-6400, Li-Cor) open gas exchange
    system. Where possible, a second LI-6400 was used on adjacent leaves of the same
    plant, allowing cross-checks for consistency in measurement. Steady-state measurements
    were made on similar fully expanded young leaves at an ambient CO2 concentration
    (Ca) of 375umol mol-1, between 0900 and 1500 h on sunny days. Leaf temperature
    was allowed to follow ambient conditions, which ranged between 15 and 32 deg C.   Photosynthetic
    light response curves were measured for all seven greenhouse-grown eucalypt species.
    A standard irradiance of 1800 umol PAR photons m-2 s-1 was adopted for all species
    during the measurement of CO2 response curves, with the block temperature maintained
    at 22 deg C, a flow rate of 500 umol s-1 and the relative humidity of air entering
    the leaf chamber maintained between 70 and 80%. Following equilibration, Aa was
    measured at ambient CO2 (375 umol mol-1) and a series of nine consecutive CO2
    concentrations from 50 to 1300 umol mol-1.As with the ANBG measurements, two LI-6400s
    were used.  At the time of measurement, only E. elata,E. bridgesiana, E. mannifera
    and E. polyanthemos plants had grown fully expanded, new leaves.There were no
    new leaves on minus nitrogen E. polyanthemos plants at this time. To allow contrasts
    between all species, at least four pre-existing, non-necrotic leaves on different
    plants from the plus nitrogen treatment were measured.
