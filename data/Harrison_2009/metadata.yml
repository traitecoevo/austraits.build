  methods: When gas exchange measurements were completed each day, leaves were detached and the segment used for measurement of photosynthesis was cut out and weighed. The segment area was determined using a leaf area meter (Li-Cor L3100, Li-Cor Inc.). All ANBG leaf segments were dried for a minimum of 48 h at 80 °C then reweighed, allowing calculation of leaf dry mass per unit area (LMA).

  methods: All dried leaves were ground separately in a ball mill. The nitrogen concentration of the photosynthetic segment was assayed using an elemental analyser (EA 1110 CHNO; Carlo-Erba Instruments, Milan, Italy) with a typical machine precision of 0.02% N. Approximately 1.2 mg of each segment was analysed.

  methods: A protocol was adapted from Lamport (1965) and Onoda et al. (2004) to remove soluble protein from the milled leaf material. Approximately 10 mg of freeze-dried leaf was extracted in 1.5 mL of buffer (50 mm tricine, pH 8.1) containing 1% PVP40 (average molecular weight 40 000,product no. 1407; Sigma Chemical Company, St Louis,MO, USA). The sample was vortexed, centrifuged at 12 000 g for 5 min (Eppendorf AG 5424, Hamburg, Germany) and the supernatant was carefully removed. The pellet was resuspended in buffer without PVP containing 1% sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS), incubated at 90 °C for 5 min, then centrifuged at 12 000 g for 5 min. This was repeated, and then two washes with 0.2 m KOH, two washes with deionized water and finally two washes with ethanol were carried out. The tube containing the pellet was then oven-dried at 80 °C. The remaining dry mass of pellet was assumed to represent the leaf structural biomass, and the N content was determined on 2–5 mg of material using the elemental analyser as above.

  methods: A duplicate set of leaves, matching those used for photosynthesis measurements, was sampled   for cell wall nitrogen measurement, being snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, then stored at -80 °C until used. Leaves were then freeze-dried at -45 °C, 64 mT for at least 3 d, using a Microprocessor Controlled Bench-Top Lyophilizer (FTS Systems, Inc., Stone Ridge, NY, USA). All sampled greenhouse eucalypt leaf segments were freeze-dried.A protocol was adapted from Lamport (1965) and Onoda et al. (2004) to remove soluble protein from the milled leaf material. Approximately 10 mg of freeze-dried leaf was extracted in 1.5 mL of buffer (50 mm tricine, pH 8.1) containing 1% PVP40 (average molecular weight 40 000,product no. 1407; Sigma Chemical Company, St Louis,MO, USA). The sample was vortexed, centrifuged at 12 000 g for 5 min (Eppendorf AG 5424, Hamburg, Germany) and the supernatant was carefully removed. The pellet was resuspended in buffer without PVP containing 1% sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS), incubated at 90 °C for 5 min, then centrifuged at 12 000 g for 5 min. This was repeated, and then two washes with 0.2 m KOH, two washes with deionized water and finally two washes with ethanol were carried out. The tube containing the pellet was then oven-dried at 80 °C. The remaining dry mass of pellet was assumed to represent the leaf structural biomass, and the N content was determined on 2–5 mg of material using the elemental analyser as above. 'The fraction of leaf nitrogen in cell wall material,NCW/NL, was calculated using Eqn 2 where the fraction of cell wall material (MCW) recovered from the total leaf biomass (ML) was multiplied by the nitrogen concentration of cell wall material (NCW/MCW) divided by the leaf nitrogen concentration (NL/ML). Attempts were made to extract Rubisco for several of the species using the method which has routinely been used for Nicotiana tabacum (Mate et al. 1993).We tried to grind fresh leaves, or leaves frozen in liquid N2, using mortar and pestle, a Ten Broeck homogenizer or a Polytron, and we also tried to extract freeze-dried leaf material that was ball milled. None of our attempts yielded adequate soluble protein or Rubisco, presumably because we were unable to successfully rupture the mesophyll cells.

  methods: Measurements of CO2 assimilation rate per unit area (Aa) in the ANBG were made at saturating irradiance (Table 1), which was determined for each species by first measuring a light response curve. Measurements were made on leaves for all species except Acacia, where phyllodes were used, from 28 March 2006 to 24 April 2006, using an infrared gas analyser (IRGA) (LI-6400, Li-Cor) open gas exchange system. Where possible, a second LI-6400 was used on adjacent leaves of the same plant, allowing cross-checks for consistency in measurement. Steady-state measurements were made on similar fully expanded young leaves at an ambient CO2 concentration (Ca) of 375umol mol-1, between 0900 and 1500 h on sunny days. Leaf temperature was allowed to follow ambient conditions, which ranged between 15 and 32 °C.   Photosynthetic light response curves were measured for all seven greenhouse-grown eucalypt species. A standard irradiance of 1800 umol PAR photons m-2 s-1 was adopted for all species during the measurement of CO2 response curves, with the block temperature maintained at 22 °C, a flow rate of 500 umol s-1 and the relative humidity of air entering the leaf chamber maintained between 70 and 80%. Following equilibration, Aa was measured at ambient CO2 (375 umol mol-1) and a series of nine consecutive CO2 concentrations from 50 to 1300 umol mol-1.As with the ANBG measurements, two LI-6400s were used.  At the time of measurement, only E. elata,E. bridgesiana, E. mannifera and E. polyanthemos plants had grown fully expanded, new leaves.There were no new leaves on minus nitrogen E. polyanthemos plants at this time. To allow contrasts between all species, at least four pre-existing, non-necrotic leaves on different plants from the plus nitrogen treatment were measured.

  methods: 'see previous variable for general method; The model developed by Farquhar, von Caemmerer & Berry (1980) was used to scale all Aa measurements to a common intercellular CO2 partial pressure (Ci) of 300 umol mol-1 (Aa300).This approach was carried out using Eqn 1 in manuscript, assuming the in vivo maximum carboxylation activity of Rubisco per unit area (Vcmax) was limiting photosynthesis (Aa). The kinetic constants of Rubisco (Kc and Ko, the Michaelis–Menten constants for CO2 and O2, respectively, and G, the CO2 compensation point in the absence of dark respiration, Rd) were adopted from von Caemmerer et al. (1994) assuming infinite internal conductance, with their temperature dependence functions given in von Caemmerer (2000).Rd was assumed to be 0.1 of Aa for theANBG data.These assumptions were validated from CO2 response curves measured on the eucalypt leaves (data not shown).'
