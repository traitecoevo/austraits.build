  description: A study using 14 years of data collected across 13 plots with different
    fire histories in the Wet Tropics of north-eastern Australia to test predictions
    regarding rainforest seedling recruitment and post-fire regenerative capacity.
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: seedling adult
  sampling_strategy: The study was conducted in the Wet Tropics of north-eastern Australia.
    A total of 85 surveys were undertaken across 13 permanent plots over the 14 years.
    The plots were positioned at the eucalypt forest-rainforest ecotone, and spread
    across the landscape in an attempt to accommodate any spatial variability in forest
    and fire regime. Each plot contained sufficient grass cover (Themeda triandra
    and/or Imperata cylindrica) at the time of establishment to ensure fires would
    carry across the landscape containing the plots. Six 100-m2 permanently marked,
    repeatedly surveyed monitoring plots were located across a 5-km area at the Wallaman
    Falls section of Girringun National Park (18.600°S; 145.804°E), approximately
    50 km west of Ingham. Seven 100-m2 plots were located across a 30-km area in the
    Paluma area within the Australian Wildlife Conservancy's Taravale-Mt Zero Sanctuary
    and adjacent Paluma Range National Park (19.039°S; 146.132°E), approximately 70
    km north-west of Townsville. Repeated surveys of plots over many years, rather
    than a single large survey of sites with different fire histories, accommodate
    inherent spatial variation, document species change over time and, most importantly,
    allow plant regeneration observations after multiple fires (Lonsdale & Braithwaite
    1991; Russell-Smith et al. 2003). ^p With the exception of a high severity wildfire
    in 2003, which was documented in one plot (Taravale/Paluma 6), all fires were
    purposely lit as part of a regular prescribed burning programme across the landscape.
    The burns varied in intensity across plots and over years. While no fire intensity
    measurements were made, the fires were of sufficient intensity to scorch crowns
    of 4-8 m tall saplings. The prescribed fires were considered of a moderate intensity,
    in comparison to wet tropical eucalypt forest fires witnessed by the authors over
    the years, being less severe than the wildfires during the 2002/3 drought, but
    of sufficient intensity to travel at walking speed through the forest understorey.^p
    Each plot was burnt between 0-5 times, and surveyed 2-10 times over 5-14 years
    during the period 1996-2009 (see Appendix S1). During each survey, all individuals
    of shrubs and tree species, both sclerophyll and rainforest, were counted, including
    newly emerged seedlings. The mode of plant regeneration was documented by distinguishing
    recently germinated seedlings from existing plants and whether post-fire resprouting
    originated from along sub-soil roots, at the base of stems or epicormically from
    branches and trunks above ground level.^p The timing of rainforest recruitment
    ^p Data of recently emerged seedlings from all 85 surveys of the 13 plots were
    combined to examine the timing of seedling recruitment with respect to years since
    fire. The numbers of newly emerged seedlings per plot, documented during each
    of the 85 plot surveys, were used as replicates in the analysis. Rainforest seedling
    density was compared with seedling density of open eucalypt forest, sclerophyll
    species. A two-factor analysis of variance was used to test for significance of
    differences, with years since fire of the survey (1, 2, 3 and >3 years) and type
    of species (rainforest or eucalypt forest) as the two factors. Seedling data were
    log(x + 1) transformed prior to analysis. ^p The pattern of seedling survival
    of the most abundantly germinating sclerophyll (Acacia cincinnata) and rainforest
    species (Alphitonia petrei) was examined graphically. ^p The effect of frequent
    fire on plant density ^p The effect of frequent burning on the persistence of
    rainforest and eucalypt forest sclerophyll species was evaluated through several
    analyses. An analysis of covariance used plant density data to evaluate whether
    the number of fires affected plant density. The 13 plots were grouped into three
    fire categories, low (plots that experienced 0 or 1 fire over the study, 5 plots
    in total); medium (experienced 2 fires, 5 plots); and high (experienced 5 fires,
    3 plots). The analysis of covariance compared the density of sclerophyll and rainforest
    plants documented during the last survey of each plot, and used the plant density
    in the initial survey of that plot as a covariate. In this way, the analysis of
    covariance evaluated change over time in plant density with different numbers
    of fires. ^p A repeated measures analysis of variance was used to test for a fire
    frequency effect on total plant density for the five plots at Wallaman (Wallaman
    1-5) that spanned the full 14-year study. This analysis used eight levels of the
    repeated factor 'year of survey' and two fire regime levels (burnt once and burnt
    five times). ^p A further analysis of covariance was undertaken on the three Wallaman
    Falls plots burnt five times, to test whether there was any difference in the
    density of sclerophyll plants compared with rainforest plants following a decade
    of frequent fire.
