  description: An experiment to investigate where Eucalyptus globulus, a widely planted
    plantation species, would show high potential for acclimation of photosynthetic
    traits across a wide range of growth conditions, including elevated [CO2] and
    climate warming.
  basis_of_record: lab
  life_stage: sapling
  sampling_strategy: Plant material Eucalyptus globulus ssp. globulus planting material
    was obtained from a commercial tree nursery in Victoria as firstseason tube stock
    seedlings. Seedlings for this study were from Seedlot No. 08-12-106M, originally
    collected from Cape Otway, Vic (38 deg 48'S, 143 deg 37'E), about 700 km and five
    degrees of latitude poleward from where they were grown for this experiment at
    the Hawkesbury Forest Experiment (HFE) site in Richmond, NSW (33 deg 36'38.92''S,
    150 deg 44'27.75''E). Many climatic aspects differ between these locations, but
    as an example the historical mean maximum January temperature is 21.4 deg C for
    Cape Otway and 29.4 deg C for Richmond, NSW. This seedlot had been selected for
    increased volume gain over wild-type E. globulus ssp. globulus in unimproved native
    stands, and was an example of germplasm commercially deployed for planting at
    the time of the experiment (Elders Forestry Ltd., Albany, Victoria, Australia).
    Tube stock E. globulus seedlings were exposed to treatment conditions in controlled
    tree chambers (see below) for 15 months starting in August 2010. The seedlings
    were maintained in the experimental treatments whilst in small 5 l pots, transferred
    to 25 l pots in October and planted into the ground at the end of November prior
    to start of summer. Seedlings were supplied with 50 g of diammonium phosphate
    on establishment. One tree per chamber was planted into the ground and grown until
    the trees had reached 9.5 m height in November 2011, 15 months after planting.
    Site description and experimental design The HFE consists of a set of 12 tall
    closed chambers for exposing plants to different climatic and atmospheric conditions
    whilst simultaneously measuring whole-tree fluxes of CO2 and water vapour (Barton
    et al., 2010). The site and experimental chambers were described in detail by
    Barton et al. (2010). In brief, the site is located in a humid temperate climate
    with a mean daily maximum temperature of 29.4 deg C in January and a mean daily
    minimum temperature of 3.2 deg C in July, with a mean annual precipitation of
    800 mm. The mean daily maximum temperatures for February, August and December
    are 28.6, 18.8 and 28.8 deg C respectively. In the last 20 years at this site,
    there have been on average 8 days between January and February where maximum air
    temperature has exceeded 35  deg C (Australian Bureau of Meteorology, unpublished
    results). Soils are sandy loam at the surface, with clay deposits at a depth of
    about 1 m below the surface. The HFE tree chambers consist of 12 CO2- and temperature-controlled
    whole-tree chambers surrounded by a block of Eucalyptus plantations. Four treatments
    were applied to the chambers as a factorial between ambient temperature (aT) and
    ambient +3 deg C (eT) by ambient CO2 concentration (aC) and ambient CO2 +240 ppm
    (eC), with three replicates per atmospheric [CO2] and temperature treatment combination
    (see Fig. 1). The combined eCeT treatment approximately mimics expected conditions
    for eastern Australia around 2070 under contemporary emissions scenarios. The
    experimental chambers at the HFE were previously described by Barton et al. (2010),
    but for this study they were upgraded to improve temperature and humidity control.
    These modifications enabled more precise control of atmospheric humidity within
    the chambers to allow relative humidity to be controlled to the same value across
    all treatments including the 3 deg C warming treatment, avoiding a common problem
    with climate warming studies (Amthor et al., 2010; Lin et al., 2012). Global climate
    models suggest that regionally averaged relative humidity should be approximately
    preserved under global warming based on the hypothesis that the world on average
    behaves similar to a thermodynamic equilibrium evaporator (Raupach, 2001). The
    tree chambers at the HFE site were modified to enable independent temperature
    control of the heat exchangers among chambers with the addition of stepped 9 kW
    heaters in the air handling unit of all chambers, with the heaters used mainly
    to regulate the warmed chambers at ambient temperature +3 deg C but also to achieve
    superambient temperatures for short periods during the gas exchange campaigns.
    One tree per chamber was transplanted into the ground at the beginning of December
    2010 after 5 months of growth in 25 l pots under the experimental treatments.
    Shortly thereafter, the first photosynthetic CO2 response curve measurements were
    made at multiple temperatures on saplings about 1 m tall. In February 2011, these
    same response curve measurements at different temperatures were made in the upper
    canopy (6th or 7th node on the 10th branch of the main stem from the top of the
    tree) of 2.5 m tall trees. A third set of the photosynthetic CO2 response curve
    measurements were made in late winter (26th August-8th September 2011, hereafter
    referred to as 'August'). At this time, the measurements were made in mid- to
    upper-crown positions on trees reaching 6.5 m tall. All leaves of E. globulus
    were juvenile leaves in these different months, which are characterized by horizontal
    leaves clasping the main stem. These leaves are hypostomatous and stomatal and
    boundary layer conductances in the leaf chamber were computed assuming this stomatal
    distribution. Trees were watered every 3-7 days using an automatic watering system,
    the amount and frequency was modified seasonally, to maintain a nonlimiting water
    supply throughout the study.

  notes: A number of observations for 'leaf_light_respiration_per_area' are showing
    up as duplicates, because the values adjusted to 25C and the raw values are sometimes
    identical; both formulations are read into AusTraits, but the data are in separate

  methods: Controlled photosynthetic CO2 response curve measurements were made using
    Li-Cor 6400 portable infrared gas analysers (LiCor Inc., Lincoln, NE, USA). CO2
    response curves of net CO2 assimilation (Anet) were developed at a constant temperature
    (termed 'Anet-Ci curves') for intact leaves within each tree chamber. These Anet-Ci
    curve measurements progressed at four to five specified leaf temperatures for
    the same leaf (i.e. one leaf per chamber) in each of three seasons (early summer,
    December 2010; late summer, February 2011; and late winter, August 2011). Each
    Anet-Ci response curve started with a steady-state measurement at the growth [CO2]
    (henceforth called 'Anet at the growth [CO2]') and then consisted of 11 additional
    steps all measured at a constant set leaf temperature while using light-saturating
    photon flux density (PFD) of 1800 umol m-2 s-1. There were at least five [CO2]
    levels used in the linear part of the curve, and at least three steps measured
    in the saturating part of the curve. These Anet-Ci response curves were measured
    on a leaf at the lowest set temperature (20 deg C) and then repeated fourmore
    times on the same leaf, each time at an increased leaf temperature for each curve
    following a progression of 25, 30, 35 and 41 deg C. From Anet-Ci response measurements
    conducted at the set leaf temperatures, the photosynthetic parameters Jmax and
    Vcmax from the biochemical model of Farquhar et al. (1980) can be extracted (e.g.
    see (Bernacchi et al., 2002, 2001; Medlyn et al., 2002a). During the leaf-level
    measurements, the entire tree was subjected to similar air temperatures in the
    whole-tree chambers during the measurements. The entire tree was exposed to each
    set temperature for at least 0.5 h before leaf gas exchange measurements started,
    resulting in approximately 1.5 h duration set at each temperature level. At each
    temperature, the curve was started with a measurement of Anet at the growth [CO2]
    using the [CO2] appropriate for the long-term treatment for each chamber tree.
    See manuscript for additional details on how humidity was controlled in the experimental
    chambers to minimize stomatal closure.

  methods: To determine the temperature dependence of the CO2 compensation point in
    the absence of daylight respiration (U*), measurements of the initial slope from
    Anet-Ci response curves at different PFDs were conducted on a single leaf at four
    different temperatures (20, 25, 32, 40 deg C) in the leaf cuvette (Laisk, 1977;
    Peisker & Apel, 2001). During these measurements, the entire tree was subjected
    to similar air temperatures as those within the leaf chamber. The three PFDs used
    for these measurements were 1800, 500 and 200 umol m-2 s-1. We used flow rates
    of 500 umol s-1 through the leaf chamber for these measurements except at the
    lowest PFD where the flow was reduced to 300 umol s-1 to increase measurement
    resolution. Each curve contained four to five points measured in the linear part
    of the Anet-Ci curve. Using the Laisk approach described in Peisker & Apel (2001),
    we simultaneously obtained the temperature dependencies of Rday, representing
    respiration in the daylight in the absence of photorespiration, and of U*. These
    measurements were conducted in March 2011. Temperature responses of both U* and
    Rday measurements were leak corrected for diffusion through the gaskets (Bruhn
    et al., 2002) and fit with an Arrhenius function as described below (Eqn 1, Medlyn
    et al., 2002a).

    a random sample of 100 leaves from each of three crown positions was also collected,
    and area was measured on each of these leaves. For Anet-Ci leaves, leaf mass per
    area ratio (LMA) was recorded before samples were ground to a homogenous powder
    to analyse for total %N and %C on a microdigestion apparatus interfacing a CHN
    elemental analyser (TruSpec; LECO Corp., St. Joseph, MI, USA).; Regarding the
    high leaf N values, the author notes, given that E globulus was moved 700 km north
    of its native distribution, it may have adapted via a change in Nmass as we have
    seen in other studies (Sharwood et al. 2014, Crous et al. 2017 Tree Phys).

    on a leaf at the lowest set temperature (20 deg C) and then repeated fourmore
    times on the same leaf, each time at an increased leaf temperature for each curve
    following a progression of 25, 30, 35 and 41 deg C. From Anet-Ci response measurements
    conducted at the set leaf temperatures, the photosynthetic parameters Jmax and
    Vcmax from the biochemical model of Farquhar et al. (1980) can be extracted (e.g.
    see (Bernacchi et al., 2002, 2001; Medlyn et al., 2002a). During the leaf-level
    measurements, the entire tree was subjected to similar air temperatures in the
    whole-tree chambers during the measurements. The entire tree was exposed to each
    set temperature for at least 0.5 h before leaf gas exchange measurements started,
    resulting in approximately 1.5 h duration set at each temperature level. At each
    temperature, the curve was started with a measurement of Anet at the growth [CO2]
    using the [CO2] appropriate for the long-term treatment for each chamber tree.

    chambers to minimize stomatal closure.

  methods: Controlled photosynthetic CO2 response curve measurements were made using

    response curves of net CO2 assimilation (Anet) were developed at a constant temperature
    (termed 'Anet-Ci curves') for intact leaves within each tree chamber. These Anet-Ci
    curve measurements progressed at four to five specified leaf temperatures for
    the same leaf (i.e. one leaf per chamber) in each of three seasons (early summer,
    December 2010; late summer, February 2011; and late winter, August 2011). Each
    Anet-Ci response curve started with a steady-state measurement at the growth [CO2]
    (henceforth called 'Anet at the growth [CO2]') and then consisted of 11 additional
    steps all measured at a constant set leaf temperature while using light-saturating
    photon flux density (PFD) of 1800 umol m-2 s-1. There were at least five [CO2]
    levels used in the linear part of the curve, and at least three steps measured

  methods: To determine the temperature dependence of the CO2 compensation point in
    the absence of daylight respiration (U*), measurements of the initial slope from
    Anet-Ci response curves at different PFDs were conducted on a single leaf at four
    different temperatures (20, 25, 32, 40 deg C) in the leaf cuvette (Laisk, 1977;
    Peisker & Apel, 2001). During these measurements, the entire tree was subjected
    to similar air temperatures as those within the leaf chamber. The three PFDs used
    for these measurements were 1800, 500 and 200 umol m-2 s-1. We used flow rates
    of 500 umol s-1 through the leaf chamber for these measurements except at the
    lowest PFD where the flow was reduced to 300 umol s-1 to increase measurement
    resolution. Each curve contained four to five points measured in the linear part
    of the Anet-Ci curve. Using the Laisk approach described in Peisker & Apel (2001),
    we simultaneously obtained the temperature dependencies of Rday, representing
    respiration in the daylight in the absence of photorespiration, and of U*. These
    measurements were conducted in March 2011. Temperature responses of both U* and
    Rday measurements were leak corrected for diffusion through the gaskets (Bruhn
    et al., 2002) and fit with an Arrhenius function as described below (Eqn 1, Medlyn
    et al., 2002a).
