  description: Study investigating community-wide hydraulic vulnerability segmentation
    by comparing leaf/shoot and stem vulnerability in dominant species of a diverse
    dry sclerophyll woodland community.
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: This study was conducted on the east coast of Tasmania, Australia.
    At the study site, the woody vegetation consisted of two canopy layers - a 5-20
    m overstory and a 1-3 m understory (Skelton, Brodribb, McAdam, et al., 2017).
    We selected the eight dominant woody species from this site, which consisted of
    four canopy trees species that included one gymnosperm and three angiosperm and
    four angiosperm understory shrubs (Table 1). We measured xylem embolism formation
    in stems using the optical vulnerability technique (Brodribb et al., 2017). For
    each species, branches from three individuals were collected from the study site.
    We cut the branches early in the morning (~6.00 a.m.) to ensure that they were
    hydrated, and once cut, we immediately sealed them in plastic bag with moist paper
    towels to make sure that they were kept hydrated while being transported back
    to the laboratory at the University of Tasmania. All branches were over 1 m in
    length to reduce the likelihood of any open vessels being present in the distal
    parts of the branch. Small distal branches, c. 0.3 cm in diameter, with healthy
    foliage were chosen and a length of bark (c. 2 cm) was carefully removed to expose
    the xylem. ^p Due to the very small size of leaves in some species (including
    their reduction to scales in Callitris and Allocasuarina), it was not possible
    to employ the optical method in all these species. Hence, leaf vulnerability to
    water deficit curves was extracted from Skelton, Brodribb, McAdam, et al. (2017),
    where the same plant community of trees and shrubs was measured in 2016. In this
    study, leaf hydraulic conductance (kleaf) was measured using the rehydration kinetics
    method on whole leaves or in the case of microphyllous leaves or needle leaves
    small terminal shoots were measured (Skelton, Brodribb, McAdam, et al., 2017).
    We extracted the xylem water potentials associated with 12% (P12 kleaf, MPa) and
    50% (P50 kleaf, MPa) loss of kleaf. ^p HSM were calculated as the difference between
    midday leaf water potential (minimum water potential) and P12 (P12 HSM), P50 (P50
    HSM) and P88 (P88 HSM) embolism extracted from OVC. Midday leaf water potential
    was taken from Skelton, Brodribb, McAdam, et al. (2017) when water potential was
    measured on the same plant community during the end of a severe drought caused
    by the 2015-2016 El Niño Pacific southern oscillation (Table S1).

    vegetation type: Evergreen dry sclerophyll woodland
    notes: This study was conducted on the east coast of Tasmania, Australia. Vegetation
      at our study site is evergreen dry sclerophyll woodland. Woodlands originally
      covered close to 30% of the Australian continent including Tasmania and are
      often dominated by Callitris spp., Casuarina spp., Eucalyptus spp. and Melaleuca
      spp. (Lindenmayer, Crane, & Michael, 2005). At the study site, the woody vegetation
      consisted of two canopy layers - a 5-20 m overstory and a 1-3 m understory (Skelton,
      Brodribb, McAdam, et al., 2017). We selected the eight dominant woody species
      from this site, which consisted of four canopy trees species that included one
      gymnosperm and three angiosperm and four angiosperm understory shrubs (Table
      1).

  methods: We measured xylem embolism formation in stems using the optical vulnerability
    technique (Brodribb et al., 2017). For each species, branches from three individuals
    were collected from the study site. We cut the branches early in the morning (~6:00
    a.m.) to ensure that they were hydrated, and once cut, we immediately sealed them
    in plastic bag with moist paper towels to make sure that they were kept hydrated
    while being transported back to the laboratory at the University of Tasmania.
    All branches were over 1 m in length to reduce the likelihood of any open vessels
    being present in the distal parts of the branch. Small distal branches, c. 0.3
    cm in diameter, with healthy foliage were chosen and a length of bark (c. 2 cm)
    was carefully removed to expose the xylem. An adhesive hydrogel (Tensive) was
    then applied to the exposed stem section to reduce reflections on the surface
    and aid light penetration into the sample and the branch was secured under a camera
    lens in a dark room. Once secured, the camera was set to capture images once every
    2 min, and the sample was left to dry slowly until embolism events were no longer
    recorded (c. 72-168 hr later depending on the species). As the branch dried, the
    target region of the stem was illuminated using LED lights during image capture.
    Simultaneously, stem water potential was logged every 10 min using a stem psychrometer
    (ICT International). Leaf water potential was measured periodically using a Pressure
    Chamber Instrument (PMS Instrument Company) to ensure agreement with the stem
    psychrometers. Leaves were excised, wrapped in moist paper towel and immediately
    measured. All optical vulnerability curves (OVC) were performed over a 4-month
    period between October 2017 and January 2018 following a year with above average
    rainfall (2016 rainfall = 965 mm; Australian Bureau of Meteorology). ^p Images
    of stem embolism were analysed using ImageJ (Figure 1; National Institutes of
    Health) following Brodribb et al. (2016) and Brodribb et al. (2017). Briefly,
    images are converted to 8-bit grayscale with pixel values ranging from black (0)
    to 255 (white). Successive images are subtracted to reveal embolism as subtle
    changes in light intensity (differences in pixel values). Differences in pixels
    due to noise or artefacts (e.g. sample movement or shrinkage) were removed using
    outlier removal in ImageJ or manually where it was clear that pixels were unrelated
    to an embolism event. Embolism in each stem was quantified as a cumulative total
    of embolized pixels in each image divided by the total number of embolized pixels
    in the fully dried sample (cumulative percentage xylem embolism). To determine
    the water potential at the time of image capture, a regression model (typically
    linear) was fitted to the water potential measurements over time. Full details
    of the procedure, including an overview of the technique, image processing, as
    well as ImageJ scripts, are available at http://www.opensourceov.org. ^p Percentage
    embolism was plotted against water potential at time of image capture and fitted
    with a sigmoidal relationship, from which we extracted the water potential at
    12% (P12 embolism, MPa) and 50% (P50 embolism, MPa) embolism (see formula in manuscript).
    ^p Due to the very small size of leaves in some species (including their reduction
    to scales in Callitris and Allocasuarina), it was not possible to employ the optical
    method in all these species. Hence, leaf vulnerability to water deficit curves
    was extracted from Skelton, Brodribb, McAdam, et al. (2017), where the same plant
    community of trees and shrubs was measured in 2016. ^p Hydraulic safety margin
    (HSM) were calculated as the difference between midday leaf water potential and
    P12 (P12 HSM), P50 (P50 HSM) and P88 (P88 HSM) embolism extracted from OVC. Midday
    leaf water potential was taken from Skelton, Brodribb, McAdam, et al. (2017) when

    drought caused by the 2015-2016 El Niño Pacific southern oscillation (Table S1).

    12% (P12 embolism, MPa) and 50% (P50 embolism, MPa) embolism (see formula in manuscript).
    ^p Due to the very small size of leaves in some species (including their reduction
    to scales in Callitris and Allocasuarina), it was not possible to employ the optical
    method in all these species. Hence, leaf vulnerability to water deficit curves
    was extracted from Skelton, Brodribb, McAdam, et al. (2017), where the same plant
    community of trees and shrubs was measured in 2016. ^p Hydraulic safety margin
    (HSM) were calculated as the difference between midday leaf water potential and
    P12 (P12 HSM), P50 (P50 HSM) and P88 (P88 HSM) embolism extracted from OVC. Midday
    leaf water potential was taken from Skelton, Brodribb, McAdam, et al. (2017) when
    water potential was measured on the same plant community during the end of a severe
    drought caused by the 2015-2016 El Niño Pacific southern oscillation (Table S1).
