  description: SLA for 10 rainforest seedlings
  collection_type: glasshouse
  sample_age_class: seedlings
  sampling_strategy: Tree species were chosen with the aim of representing the range
    of light requirements present in old-growth assemblages on lowland rainforest
    sites in tropical Queensland and temperate Tasmania. Our focal sites for choosing
    species were the Daintree Rainforest Observatory in Queensland (16°17'S, 145°29'E,
    40 m a.s.l.) and the Arve Road area near the Tahune Airwalk in Tasmania (43°06'S,
    146°44'E, 70 m a.s.l.). In Tasmania, choice of species was straightforward, as
    only four angiosperm rainforest trees were common at the site (Table 1), a figure
    typical of Tasmanian lowland rainforest in general (Kirkpatrick, 1977; Read, 1995).
    We excluded species thought to be largely dependent on fire for establishment,
    such as eucalypts. In Queensland, we chose five of our six species from among
    those represented by adults on the 1-ha circular plot beneath the canopy crane
    at Daintree Rainforest Observatory. From within this pool of 82 species, we chose
    two that were abundant as juveniles in shaded understoreys (Endiandra microneura
    and Myristica globosa ssp. muelleri), two that were abundant on forest margins
    (Elaeocarpus angustifolius and Polyscias australiana), and one that was abundant
    in the intermediate light environments found beneath a nearby second-growth stand
    (Palaquium galactoxylon). Our sixth tropical species (Melicope jonesii) was abundantly
    represented by juveniles on forest margins at another Queensland forest site,
    Danbulla National Park (17°7'S, 145°38'E, 700 m a.s.l.). Experimental growth conditions
    Plants were grown in glasshouses in two temperate regimes, intended to approximate
    growing season temperatures in tropical and temperate rainforest environments.
    These were set at 29/21°C and 24/16°C, respectively. Two glasshouses were randomly
    assigned to each temperature treatment, giving us some power to test for unintended
    effects resulting from environment differences between glasshouses. Seedlings
    were transplanted to 8-L plastic pots, filled with a clay loam soil developed
    under warm-temperate rainforest but converted to pasture approx. 25 years ago.
    This soil was found to be well supplied with most macronutrients (Supplementary
    Data Table S1) but deficient in nitrogen. Accordingly, urea was added twice during
    the experiment, at 20 g m22 (i.e. about 1 g per plot), to produce the total N
    levels shown in Table S1. Seedlings were allowed 2–3 weeks to recover from transplanting
    before beginning growth measurements. Four to five seedlings of each species were
    then randomly allocated to each glasshouse, and seedling positions on benches
    were re-randomized fortnightly to neutralize effects of environmental variation
    within glasshouses. On the north side of each bench, 75% shade-cloth screens were
    installed to shield plants from most direct solar radiation. Seedlings were watered
    by automatic sprinkler systems at intervals that were frequently adjusted in response
    to weather variation. However, some plants required extra watering by hand because
    of the vagaries of the watering system, heterogeneity in direct solar radiation
    reaching the benches, or high demand resulting from large foliage areas.

  methods: Leaf area was determined using a LI-3100 leaf area meter (LI-COR, Lincoln,
    NE, USA), enabling estimation of initial SLA and LAR. Plant material was dried
    at 65°C for 48 h before determining dry weights.c

taxonomic_updates:
- find: Palaquium galactoxlyon
  replace: Palaquium galactoxylon
  reason: Change spelling to align with APC or ALA species lists (Sam Andrew, 2018-02-07)
- find: Palaquium galactoxylon
  replace: Palaquium galactoxylum
  reason: Synonym reported by TaxonStand (2018-02-08)
questions:
  austraits: The manuscript indicates species were collected at three different
    sites, but a "site" column does not exist in the data file - presumably because they were glasshouse grown plants. Should the location data be omitted completely?
