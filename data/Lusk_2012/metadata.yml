  description: SLA for seedlings of 10 rainforest tree species
  collection_type: glasshouse
  sample_age_class: seedling
  sampling_strategy: Tree species were chosen with the aim of representing the range
    of light requirements present in old-growth assemblages on lowland rainforest
    sites in tropical Queensland and temperate Tasmania. Our focal sites for choosing
    species were the Daintree Rainforest Observatory in Queensland (16deg17'S, 145deg29'E,
    40 m a.s.l.) and the Arve Road area near the Tahune Airwalk in Tasmania (43deg06'S,
    146deg44'E, 70 m a.s.l.). In Tasmania, choice of species was straightforward,
    as only four angiosperm rainforest trees were common at the site (Table 1), a
    figure typical of Tasmanian lowland rainforest in general (Kirkpatrick, 1977;
    Read, 1995). We excluded species thought to be largely dependent on fire for establishment,
    such as eucalypts. In Queensland, we chose five of our six species from among
    those represented by adults on the 1-ha circular plot beneath the canopy crane
    at Daintree Rainforest Observatory. From within this pool of 82 species, we chose
    two that were abundant as juveniles in shaded understoreys (Endiandra microneura
    and Myristica globosa ssp. muelleri), two that were abundant on forest margins
    (Elaeocarpus angustifolius and Polyscias australiana), and one that was abundant
    in the intermediate light environments found beneath a nearby second-growth stand
    (Palaquium galactoxylon). Our sixth tropical species (Melicope jonesii) was abundantly
    represented by juveniles on forest margins at another Queensland forest site,
    Danbulla National Park (17deg7'S, 145deg38'E, 700 m a.s.l.). Experimental growth
    conditions Plants were grown in glasshouses in two temperate regimes, intended
    to approximate growing season temperatures in tropical and temperate rainforest
    environments. These were set at 29/21C and 24/16C, respectively. Two glasshouses
    were randomly assigned to each temperature treatment, giving us some power to
    test for unintended effects resulting from environment differences between glasshouses.
    Seedlings were transplanted to 8-L plastic pots, filled with a clay loam soil
    developed under warm-temperate rainforest but converted to pasture approx. 25
    years ago. This soil was found to be well supplied with most macronutrients (Supplementary
    Data Table S1) but deficient in nitrogen. Accordingly, urea was added twice during
    the experiment, at 20 g m22 (i.e. about 1 g per plot), to produce the total N
    levels shown in Table S1. Seedlings were allowed 2-3 weeks to recover from transplanting
    before beginning growth measurements. Four to five seedlings of each species were
    then randomly allocated to each glasshouse, and seedling positions on benches
    were re-randomized fortnightly to neutralize effects of environmental variation
    within glasshouses. On the north side of each bench, 75% shade-cloth screens were
    installed to shield plants from most direct solar radiation. Seedlings were watered
    by automatic sprinkler systems at intervals that were frequently adjusted in response
    to weather variation. However, some plants required extra watering by hand because
    of the vagaries of the watering system, heterogeneity in direct solar radiation
    reaching the benches, or high demand resulting from large foliage areas.

  unit_in: umolCO2/m2/s
  trait_name: photosynthetic_rate_per_area_saturated
  value_type: experiment_mean
  replicates: 4-5
  methods: Net photosynthesis at saturating light (Asat) and leaf conductance (gs)
    were measured at ambient daytime temperatures in the two treatments. Measurements
    were made between 0900 and 1500 h over 5 d in late April and early May 2011, on

- var_in: Dh (m)
  unit_in: um
  trait_name: vessel_diameter
  value_type: experiment_mean

  methods: hydraulic mean diameters of vessels (Dh). The sum of diameters for the
    entire cross-section was estimated by scaling up the sum of diameters for the
    pie slice portion that was analysed with the image software.
- var_in: Kp (kg m-1 s-1 MPa-1)
  unit_in: kg/m/s/MPa
  trait_name: sapwood_specific_conductivity_theoretical
  value_type: experiment_mean
  replicates: 4-5
  methods: Thin sections were cut from the base of each stem using a sledge microtome
    (Reichert, Vienna, Austria). These sections were then photographed (approximately
    one-quarter of each thin-section in pie slice sectors) using an epi-fluorescence
    microscope (Olympus BH-2, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a mercury lamp. This technique
    facilitated identification of vessels because the high concentrations of lignin
    in vessel walls fluoresce when exposed to ultraviolet light (Albinsson et al.,
    1999). An image analysis program (Mix; Monash University, Melbourne, Australia)
    was used to measure the cross-sectional area of each conduit and the total number
    of conduits in each image. Potential sapwood-specific conductivity (Kp) was calculated
    for each stem cross-section according to Tyree and Ewers (1991). Potential sapwood-specific
    conductivity represents the maximum conductivity that could occur through sapwood
    (normalized by length, cross-sectional area and pressure), assuming no resistance
    from end-walls, which generally contribute 50-60% to the total hydraulic resistance
    (Sperry et al., 2006). Thus, predictions of conductivity based solely on vessel
    diameters overestimate actual conductivity. Nevertheless, Kp values generally
    correlate well with actual conductivity across species (Choat et al., 2007).
