  description: A study examining the dynamics of vegetation regeneration after burning
    in three dry sclerophyll communities near Canberra, in south-eastern Australia.
  basis_of_record: field field_experiment
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: Three sites 0.15-0.20 ha in size, and each dominated by a different
    species in the tall shrub stratum, were selected for the experimental burns on
    the basis of the following factors - (1) homogeneity of the understorey vegetation;
    (2) time since previous burn; (3) suitability for carrying a fire; (4) accessibility
    for controlling the burns and for imposing subsequent treatments. ^p Preburn methods
    ^p Square quadrats with sides 1 -2 m long were set out for sampling the preburn
    vegetation and for studying vegetative regrowth after burning. Smaller plots 06
    m square, and nested in one corner of the large quadrats, were used to examine
    seedling populations. Each quadrat was located where there was a uniform litter
    cover sufficient to carry a fire, and its position marked with 15 cm long aluminium
    pegs driven 13 cm into the soil at each corner. At each of the three sites sixty
    quadrats were set out with a minimum of disturbance to the vegetation and litter.
    Thirty were located in an area to be experimentally burnt and the remainder in
    the adjacent control, unburnt area. In November-December 1972, each quadrat was
    examined and the total numbers of individuals (or shoots, for species with underground
    rhizomes) of all species growing within the plots recorded. ^p Experimental burn
    treatments ^p The experimental burns at sites A and C, and at site B, were carried
    out on 2 February and 18 January 1973, respectively, by staff of the C.S.I.R.O.
    Division of Forest Research, according to their standard procedures for control
    burning. Because the areas to be burnt were relatively small ( < 1 0 ha), each
    burn was initiated from a line of ignition points in order to obtain a more uniform
    treatment. Fire behaviour and weather data were recorded for as long as it took
    the fires to burn the entire areas in which the quadrats were located. Due to
    differences in the amount and distribution of fuel, weather conditions and other
    factors influencing burning, the fire intensities at sites A, B and C differed,
    being respectively 1834, 827, and 4205 kw/m. As experimental treatments, the burns
    at sites A and C were more uniform than at site B, where changing wind conditions
    caused highly erratic fire behaviour. ^p Postburn data collection ^p In burnt
    areas the large quadrats were examined for regrowth at monthly intervals for the
    first year after burning, and again at the end of the second year. In the adjacent
    unburnt areas all quadrats were examined at the end of one and two years after
    the burn treatments. In both burnt and unburnt areas at each site, the small quadrats
    were examined every second day until the end of the main flush of germination
    (July), and thereafter weekly until the end of one year after the burn treatments.
    At the end of two years after burning, all quadrats were re-examined.

    description: Dry sclerophyll forest falling within the Eucalyptus macrorhyncha-E.
      rossii alliance defined by Pryor (1954). Typically it consists of a tree stratum
      up to 21 m in height with a closed canopy, and a generally continuous small
      shrub stratum developed below. In winter and spring a poorly developed, discontinuous
      herb stratum may occur with the appearance of annual grasses and geophytes (especially
      orchids).
    elevation (m): 630--670
    soil type: The soils were shallow, moderately acid red earths and showed little
      profile development with depth. They contained substantial amounts of gravel
      and possessed good internal drainage characteristics, although appreciable runoff
      occurred following heavy rainfall because of the moderately steep topography.
    geology (parent material): micaceous siltstone and shale, silty quartz sandstone, radiolarian
      chert and black siliceous shale Opik (1958).
    geology (stratigraphic map unit): Pittman Formation and Acton Shale Member (Strusz & Henderson 1971).
    precipitation, MAP (mm): 626
    temperature, monthly max (C): 19.3
    temperature, monthly min (C): 6.2
    climate description: Precipitation is more or less uniformly spread throughout
      the year, but temperatures vary widely from summer to winter. Soil water is
      usually adequate for plant growth from April to November, but growth is suppressed
      by frequent frosts in most winters.

    was recorded for each plot, while the times of first appearance of regrowth, flowering
    and fruiting, and grazing of foliage were noted. In the adjacent unburnt areas
    all quadrats were examined at the end of one and two years after the burn treatments,
    and the total number of individuals per species per quadrat recorded. In both
    burnt and unburnt areas at each site, the small quadrats were examined every second
    day until the end of the main flush of germination (July), and thereafter weekly
    until the end of one year after the burn treatments. Each seedling in every quadrat
    was identified, and the dates of germination and death, and cause of mortality
    (where determinable) were recorded. At the end of two years after burning, all
    quadrats were re-examined, and surviving seedlings from the first year populations,
    plus surviving seedlings which had germinated during the second year, were identified
    and recorded.
