  description: A study was made of mineral nutrient concentrations and distributions
    in leaves and fruits of 10 species of Grevillea from diverse localities in south-western
    Australia. Seeds of all species contained high concentrations of mineral nutrients,
    despite the nutrient-poor soils of their habitats.
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: Three representative bulk samples each of 100 mature green leaves
    and mature fruits were collected in late spring from nine species of Grevillea
    from natural habitats in Western Australia (Table l), except for G. banksii which
    was sampled from plants cultivated in Perth. Species were identified by reference
    to Blackall and Grieve (1959) and to material held in the herbarium of the Botany
    Department, University of Western Australia, Perth. The first six sites were along
    a transect from coastal sand dunes at Kalbarri, inland to the eastern boundary
    of the distribution of the species in this area. The purpose of this part of the
    survey was to see if the mineral nutrient composition of fruits and leaves changed
    with distance from the coast, especially with respect to sodium and chloride.
    A representative sample of 200 fruits was collected from each of four plants of
    similar size at each of the sites listed in Table 2. The fruits had just matured
    but had not shed their seeds. A sample of 30 fully expanded pinnatisect leaves
    was collected from near the fruits for each plant

    from each sample of fruits and leaves was digested in duplicate using a Kjeldahl
    method with mercuric oxide as catalyst. Total S was determined from the perchloric
    acid digests by a turbidimetric method (Allen et al. 1974). Orchard leaf reference
    material (U.S. National Bureau of Standards 1571) was included every 20 samples
    to check the digestion and analytical procedures.

  methods: Fruits were separated into follicles and seeds in the field. Follicles
    and leaves were rinsed briefly twice in distilled water to remove any surface
    contaminants and blotted with tissue paper. All material was oven-dried at 80
    deg C and milled to pass a 20 mesh (0.84 mm) screen.  Plant material (200 mg)
    from each sample of fruits and leaves was digested in duplicate using a Kjeldahl
    method with mercuric oxide as catalyst. Concentrations of K, Ca, Mg, Na, Fe, Zn,
    Mn and Cu were determined from duplicate nitric/perchloric acid (1 to 1 vlv) digests
    of subsamples (500 mg) of plant material by atomic absorption spectrophotometry.
