  description: leaf traits for NSW species from Emma Laxton's Phd thesis at Macquarie
    University
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: Traits of mature leaves were assessed for forty-six common plant
    species (at least fifteen species per site), representing twenty-eight families
    (Fig. 3.1). Traits of immature leaves were assessed on a subset of thirty-nine
    plant species from twenty-four plant families. The phenology of leaf maturation
    was assessed for nine plant species from five families (Fig. 3.1). In the mature
    leaf trait study, all leaf variables were measured on fully-matured expanded leaves.
    Young expanding leaves less than a third the size of an average mature leaf were
    measured for each species in the immature leaf trait study. Phenology of leaf
    maturation was monitored from bud to full expansion. Where possible, immature
    leaves were collected from the same plants as mature leaves.

    description: The more fertile site in Royal National Park was located on Narrabeen
      Shales (Fig. 2.5). Soils belong to the Watangan soil group and are described
      as shallow to deep (30-200 cm) loose, stony, brownish black fine sandy or clay
      loam that has strong acidity and high potential aluminium concentrations (Hazelton
      & Tille, 1990). The higher resource sites were characterised by temperate rainforest
      (Bola Creek, RNP). The more fertile site along Bola Creek has also experienced
      fire in recent years.

    description: The infertile sites in Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park and Royal
      National Park are on the Tertiary geological deposits of Hawkesbury Sandstone
      (Sydney and Wollongong Port Hacking 1:100 000 geological map sheets, NSW Department
      of Mineral Resources. Fig. 2.2, 2.3). Hawkesbury Sandstone-derived soils are
      described as loose, coarse quartz sand that has high permeability, low available
      water holding capacity, low fertility, very high aluminium concentrations and
      pH ranges from 4 to 6 (Chapman & Murphy, 1989). The resource-poor sites were
      characterised by sclerophyll heath vegetation. The infertile site along Bundeena
      Road (RNP) has been burnt four times since 1978/79, and once in 2001/2002.

    description: The more fertile site in Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park was located
      on an approximately 20 m wide igneous dyke (Fig. 2.4), which has weathered to
      form deep red soils with a higher nutrient content than the surrounding areas.
      The higher resource sites were characterised by wet sclerophyll forest (dyke,
      KCNP). Charcoal scarring on trees in the Dyke indicate fire has impacted the
      site.

  methods: At each site (Fig.2.2; Fig.2.3), during the early mornings, up to five
    leaves were clipped randomly from five individual plants representing each plant
    species (i.e. sample size approximately 25 leaves per species at each site). Where
    possible, sunlit leaves were collected. Leaves were then wrapped separately in
    paper towelling, placed in plastic bags and moistened with water. They were refrigerated
    at 4�C and processed within 72 hours of collection. No individual plant was sampled
    more than once. Fresh leaves were weighed and were either photocopied or scanned
    directly to obtain leaf area. Leaf area was determined with a flat-bed scanner
    and DELTA-T SCAN software (Delta-T, Cambridge, UK).

    a dial gauge micrometer. Major veins and the midrib were avoided on all but the
    smallest leaves.
- var_in: force of fracture N
  unit_in: 'N'
  trait_name: leaf_fracture_force
  value_type: site_mean
  replicates: '5'
  methods: Force of fracture, or the amount of energy (work) required to fracture
    a leaf (Lucas et al., 1990), was determined using a purpose-built leaf-cutter
    designed to provide a generalised measure of physical defence (Wright & Cannon,
    2001). The midrib was dissected from all leaves, which were cut at the widest
    point along the lamina or halfway between the leaf base and tip. The leaf-cutter
    measures the force required to cut a leaf at a constant cutting angle (20�) and
    speed. The cutting blade is supported by a cantilevered arm, which rises and falls
    according to the direction of rotation of a lead screw driven by a computer-controlled
    stepper motor. 47 The leaf is placed on an anvil, providing a reference face against
    which sample shearing occurs. The force of fracture is concentrated in the centre
    of a double concave, thin section of the cantilevered arm, and measured via paired
    strain gauges mounted on either side of the arm at this point. Output from the
    strain gauges is in the form of a series of force measurements taken at regular
    intervals as the blade traverses the sample (9.1 Hz, equivalent to every 0.03
    mm along the edge of the anvil), giving a force x displacement graph. The mean
    force of fracture for a sample was calculated as the average force registered
    across the cutting trajectory divided by the gain and multiplied by a conversion
    constant (Wright & Cannon, 2001). Toughness (N m-1= J m-2) is the mean force of
    fracture (N) divided by lamina thickness (mm).
