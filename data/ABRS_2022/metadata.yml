  sampling_strategy: This dataset is sourced from the The Flora of Australia online
    website (version date 2022-09-14). Briefly, the textual descriptions of each taxon
    in were downloaded and organised into a tabular format of individual taxon names
    and their corresponding text using R coding script. Sentences and phrases were
    categorised using a large glossary of botanical terminology as referring to one
    of the following, the entire organism, stem, leaf, flower, fruit/seed, roots and
    environment/habitat. Key terms corresponding to trait values in AusTraits were
    then extracted from these smaller chunks of text using a reference table containing
    a) the AusTraits trait name, b) the AusTraits trait value and c) terms to search
    for in the text. The resulting traits were then checked manually using a subset
    of ~500 taxa to search for errors and update the reference table and coding script
    accordingly. The process was repeated iteratively to remove any wrongly classified
    trait values and to ensure as many correct trait values as possible were captured
    using the algorithm. For some traits such as plant_growth_form and life_history,
    unclassified taxa were inferred as possessing a trait value from a higher-level
    taxonomic description e.g. all taxa in the Amyema genus were classified as stem_parasitic,
    which was mentioned only in the genus description. Specific to the plant_growth_form
    trait, any taxon without a growth form and that was described as annual, biennial
    or perennial was inferred as herbaceous.
