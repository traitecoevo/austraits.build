  description: Plant fire response and other related trait data extracted from the 
    New South Wales online flora.
  basis_of_record: preserved_specimen
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: This dataset is sourced from the PlantNet online
    flora (version date 2022-05-06). Briefly, the textual descriptions of each taxon
    were downloaded and organised into a tabular format of individual taxon names
    and their corresponding text using R coding script. Sentences mentioning the words
    'burn' or 'fire' were extracted and manually scored to match relevant traits in
    AusTraits. Unclassified taxa were inferred, where possible, as possessing a trait
    value from a higher-level taxonomic description, e.g. all taxa in X genus were 
    classified as resprouts, which was mentioned only in the genus description. All 
    below-species-level taxa were also inferred from species-level values where possible.

  notes: This site presents a demonstration of one approach to an electronic Flora
    of New South Wales. Data are derived from the printed Flora of New South Wales
    series, published by the UNSW Press, augmented with data from electronic sources
    maintained by the National Herbarium of New South Wales.
