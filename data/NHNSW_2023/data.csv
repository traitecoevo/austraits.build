Inflorescence terminal, racemose or cymose or flowers solitary in leaf axils. Flowers actinomorphic, usually bisexual. Hypanthium shallow to urn- or cup-shaped with floral parts perigynous, or deeply concave and fused to carpels with floral parts epigynous. Epicalyx with 4 or 5 sepal-like bracts often present. Sepals (4 or) 5. Petals usually 5, sometimes absent or 'doubled'. Stamens 1-numerous, anthers dehiscing by longitudinal slits. Carpels 1-numerous, free or variously fused to each other and to the hypanthium. Fruits (individual fruit achenes) or fruitlets (drupelets) consist of ripe indehiscent carpels, dry or succulent, often aggregated (forming an aggregate fruit), achenes sometimes included in hypanthium or seated on a receptacle. Variable from simple, single-seeded drupes to aggregate fruits or several-seeded pomes.  Distribution and occurrence: World: c. 90 genera, c. 4828 species, cosmopolitan, especially northern temperate regions. Australia: c. 23 genera, all States.External links:Angiosperm Phylogeny Website (Family: Rosaceae, Order: Rosales)Wikipedia A number of taxa are cultivated for their fruits (including economically important crops for human consumption), e.g. Malus (apples), Prunus (plums, peaches, almonds, cherries), Rubus (blackberries, raspberries), Fragaria (strawberries), Eriobotrya (loquat); many are favourite ornamental and hedge garden plants, including roses, firethorns, hawthorns, photinias, cotoneasters; and a number are troublesome weeds, especially in farming regions. In Rosaceae the gynoecium type and fruit type is variable, providing the basis for recognising several subfamilies. The previously recognised segregate families of Rosaceae s. lat. were distinguished as follows. Family Rosaceae s. str. (subfamily Rosoideae) - carpels numerous and free, or rarely 1 or 2, 1 ovule per carpel; carpels on an elongated receptacle or sometimes included in hypanthium; fruit 1-seeded, indehiscent, usually drupes or achenes, often seated on fleshy receptacle or enclosed in hypanthium; stipules present. Family Malaceae (subfamilies Spiraeoideae and Pomoideae (= Maloideae)) - carpels usually 2-5 (range 1-12) and either carpels each with 2 or more ovules, or carpels united to inner wall of hypanthium; fruit of separate follicles or achenes or a pome; stipules present or absent. Family Amygdalaceae (subfamily Prunoideae) - carpel usually solitary, ovules 2, but 1 aborts, free of hypanthium; fruit a drupe; stipules absent."
