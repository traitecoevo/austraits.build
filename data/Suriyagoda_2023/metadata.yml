  description: In this review paper, we investigated whether allocation of P fractions
    varies among groups of terrestrial vascular plants, and is indicative of a species'
    strategy to use P efficiently.
  basis_of_record: lab field
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: We compiled the literature on the concentrations of leaf P fractions
    for a variety of terrestrial plant species (Table S1). We considered studies presenting
    the concentrations of P fractions in the form of Po and Pi, or Po fractions as
    P in metabolites, nucleic acids, lipids and a residual fraction. Data were tabulated
    on country or region, family, species, life form, types of leaves used to measure
    P (i.e. mature or senesced), soil P status (i.e. deficient or sufficient, based
    on leaf [P]) and types and concentrations (mg P g-1 DW) of leaf P fractions measured
    (Tables S1, S2). Leaf total [P] and its fractions were expressed on a leaf dry
    weight (DW) basis in all studies. Soil [P] was not included, despite a wide variation,
    as this was not measured consistently, and thus not comparable across studies;
    it was used to compare P treatments within a study. Leaves of annuals had been
    collected from plants grown either in the field or in pots, with or without supplementary
    P (Table S1). Annuals were mostly crop species. Leaves of perennials had been
    collected from field-grown plants, mostly in their natural habitat, either from
    one field site or from several sites with different soil [P] (Table S1). Complete
    data set can be accessed through the doi, 10.26182/26rb-mv37.
  original_file: SI from manuscript in raw data folder
  notes: Only Australian studies included here; eventually many will be split out,
    but for several recent studies, the manuscripts themselves do not include tables/SI
    with data, so need to contact authors. Also, currently filtering out senesced
    leaves; should instead move total P to a different column and just filter out
    others.
