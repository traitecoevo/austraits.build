  description: A comparison of fruit characteristics of an invasive species with co-occuring
    natives.
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: A sample of 50 fruits was collected from five plant species,
    C. monilifera, Tree Heath (Monotoca elliptica (Smith) R.Br. (Epacridaceae)), Blueberry
    Ash (Elaeocarpus reticulatus Smith (Elaeocarpaceae)), White Cedar (Melia azedarach
    L. (Meliaceae)) and Red Ash (Alphitonia excelsa (Fenzl) Reisseck ex Benth. (Rhamnaceae)).
    Most fruit were collected from several plants at Perkins Beach Reserve, Wollongong
    (34 deg 36'S, 150 deg 53'E). Exceptions were fruits of M. azedarach, which were
    collected at Wollongong, and Monotoca elliptica, which were collected at Myall
    Lakes National Park (NP) (32 deg 32'S, 152 deg 18'E). The native plant species
    were selected based on several criteria, they co-occur with C. monilifera in coastal
    vegetation in NSW; they have fruits dispersed by vertebrates (determined from
    records in Barker and Vestjens 1989; Floyd 1989; Barker and Vestjens 1990; Eby
    and Palmer 1991; Green 1993; Gosper 1999); and they produce fruits in sufficient
    quantity and accessibility for collection. The native plant species all differed
    from C. monilifera in growth form, however. They are all tall shrubs to trees,
    while C. monilifera has a variable shrubby habit. The following variables of each
    fruit were measured, (i) length, width and weight of the whole fruit; (ii) the
    length, width and wet weight of the hard endocarp; (iii) wet weight of the combined
    pulp and pericarp; and, from these measurements, (iv) the wet weight ratio of
    endocarp to pulp was calculated. Over three periods of ten months, the quantity
    of C. monilifera inflorescences and ripe (black) fruit per plant were counted
    monthly. Ten plants were selected at random along each of three transects and
    one count per month was completed. The first sample was monitored from September
    1995 to June 1996 (when plants were sprayed with herbicide) and the second and
    third sample from May 1999 to February 2000 (when several plants were run over
    by recreational 4WD vehicles and some died seemingly of natural causes). All samples
    were at Perkins Beach.

    each species, the pulp and pericarp from all fruits were combined to obtain a
    sufficiently large sample for analysis of crude protein, phosphorus, fat and sugar
    (glucose, fructose, and sucrose). (A single analysis was completed on 50 bulked
    fruit.) Fermentation was detected in the sample of pulp and pericarp of M. ellpitica
    used for sugar analysis, rendering the output unreliable. Consequently, sugar
    content values are not invluded for this species.
