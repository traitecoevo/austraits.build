  description: This study investigated whether water potential at turgor loss point
    could be used as a screening tool to assess drought resistance for green roof
    plant selection.
  collection_type: glasshouse
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: Plant material ^p     Shrub species were selected according to
    the heat moisture index (HMI), mean annual temperature (MAT) and mean annual precipitation
    (MAP) of the mean species distribution of Australian shrubs. The HMI was calculated
    as, (MAT+10) / (MAP/1000) (De La Torre et al. 2014; Wang et al. 2006). A mean
    HMI per shrub species was determined by the climate data for all occurrence records
    in the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA, www.ala. org.au) without any filtering
    process. We selected 20 evergreen shrubs that had HMI values ranging from 20 to
    98, where species with higher HMI originate from drier and hotter habitats, while
    species with lower HMI occur in wetter and cooler sites. And the range of MAT
    is from 10.6 to 21.2 degC and MAP is from 283.4 to 1126.4 mm. All seedlings (six
    months old) were propagated from cuttings and obtained from a native commercial
    nursery (Goldfields Revegetation Pty Ltd) in Victoria, Australia, and they were
    all mature seedlings with flowers. The seedlings were planted into 4 l black plastic
    pots (Diameter- 20 cm; Depth- 19 cm) in November 2015. Each pot was filled with
    3.8 kg of green roof substrate (60% aerolite black scoria 7 mm minus block mix,
    20% 7 mm red scoria aggregate and 20%coir with a water holding capacity of 46%and
    a dry bulk density of 1.26 g cm-3) (Farrell et al. 2012) and 12 g of low-phosphorus
    controlled-release fertiliser (16 N:1.3P:9.1 K, Osmocote plus, Scotts Australia
    Pty Ltd.). Although a pot experiment, these mimic real green roof conditions with
    shallow substrate depth and are used commonly for green roof plant selection (Farrell
    et al. 2013; Wolf and Lundholm 2008). The pot size reflects the plant density
    and substrate depth on established green roofs in Melbourne (Rayner et al. 2016).
    Plants were grown outdoors for about four months and watered twice a day with
    an automatic irrigation system before the experiment commenced. ^p     Experimental
    design and water-deficit treatment   ^p     In March 2016, 10 plants of each species
    were moved into a glasshouse at the Burnley Campus, University of Melbourne, Australia
    (37deg47'S; 144deg58'E) and were watered regularly for 2 weeks before the start
    of the watering treatments; well-watered (WW, control) and water-deficit (WD).
    Ten plants of each species were randomly assigned to each of the two treatments
    (five replicates per treatment) and were arranged in a complete randomised block
    design. WW plants were watered three times per week (Monday, Wednesday and Friday)
    to pot capacity. WD plants were watered with 50% of the water used by WW plants
    (determined gravimetrically by the difference between pot weights after watering
    and before the next watering event). The treatments continued until all 20 shrub
    species experienced 30 days of soil water content (SWC) below 20% (the wilting
    point of the scoria substrate), to allow plants to have enough time to adjust
    physiologically to water shortage, and ensure all species experienced the same
    extent of dehydration strain. This meant that the 20 shrubs species with different
    plant size were harvested on different days as they had different water use/water
    supply and dry-down rates (Blum and Tuberosa 2018). Species with larger biomass
    required shorter time to decline to 20%SWC, while others needed a longer time.
    Water-deficit treatments began in the end of summer and continued through to the
    start of winter (July 2016). The actual performance of the 20 plant species during
    the dry down period, like 20 shrub species mean SWC over time, the decline of
    predawn and midday water potentials along the decrease of the SWC can be seen
    in the supplementary (Fig. S2). A weather station in the glasshouse measured air
    temperature and relative humidity (HMP-60, Campbell Scientific Inc., North Logan,
    UT, USA) and solar radiation (SP-110 Silicon Pyranometer, Apogee, Santa Monica,
    CA, USA). Data were recorded with a data logger every minute (CR1000, Campbell
    Scientific Inc., North Logan, UT, USA). During the experimental period, mean daily
    (between 0600 h and 1800 h) temperature was 24.1 +/- 0.01  degC (range, 17.9-
    34.8  degC), mean daily relative humidity was 53.5 +/- 0.04% (range, 29.5-84.2%)
    and mean daily peak solar radiation was 334.7 +/- 0.55 W m-2 min-1 (range, 39.4-
    722.7 W m-2 min-1).

    (PV) curve analyses on the final day of waterdeficit treatment for each species,
    using the bench drying method (Arndt et al. 2015; Tyree and Hammel 1972). Five
    leaves or terminal shoots per species were sampled for PV curve measurement early
    in the morning (0600-0700 h) and recut under water before putting in 50 ml centrifuge
    tubes filled with distilled water (only 2 cm cut end of leaf or shoot were submerged)
    to rehydrate via the stem or petiole for 2-3 h or until water potentials (measured
    by Scholander-type pressure chamber, Soilmoisture Equipment Corp., Santa Barbara,
    CA, USA) were >-0.1 MPa to avoid over-saturation. Once rehydrated, samples were
    wiped dry carefully with a soft tissue and weighed to determine saturated weights.
    As samples dried on the bench, leaf water potential and leaf mass were regularly
    measured, samples were then oven dried at 70 degC until a constant weight was
    reached to determine dry mass. The PV curve parameter, turgor loss point (WP-tlp)
    was determined using the PV curve fitting routine (Schulte and Hinckley 1985).
