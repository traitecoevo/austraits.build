  description: dispersal appendage data for tropical  species
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: We have collected seeds from sufficient genera and species to
    make a large proportion of the intergeneric- but-intrafamilial and intrageneric
    comparisons between light-demanders and shade-tolerators which are possible in
    the flora of tropical lowland rain forest in north-eastern Queensland (NEQ). The
    available flora has been delimited by the list of 'rain-forest' plants recorded
    for NEQ (including the Cape York Peninsula) by Hyland, Gray & Elick (1994). We
    have restricted our sampling to forest types 1 and 5a (com- plex mesophyll vine
    forest and complex notophyll vine forest) of Tracey (1982). The sites from which
    seed has been collected range from sea level to 750 m, and from very wet (annual
    rainfall c. 4 m and, on aver- age, no 'dry month' sensu Walter 1971) to the dry
    edge of 'rain forest' near Atherton where there is only c. 14 4myear-1 (and, on
    ayerage, 4 'dry months' per year). Most of the species collected are found on
    a variety of soils derived from basalt, granite or nutri- ent-poor metamorphics.

  methods: A 'seed' is defined as a single mature fertilized ovule including the testa
    plus the fibrous inner part of the fruit wall where present. Any fleshy part of
    the fruit wall was removed, as was any aril or sarcotesta except where the latter
    is very thin and difficult to remove (as in Melicope spp.). For dry-seeded species
    any wing or plume was removed. For true seeds of mean dry mass ?30mg we separated
    the wall (testa) and the embryo- cum-endosperm (EE) fraction, and for pyrenes
    and samaras of >30mg the wall (endocarp) and the true seed except that where the
    testa and endocarp are fused, we separated the compound wall and the EE fraction.
    For species with very thick walls (>50% total seed, pyrene or samara dry mass)
    we give in the Tables the mass without the wall, and the total mass. All seeds
    were collected (under permit numbers 1685 and 1995 from Queensland National Parks
    and Wildlife Service, and permit numbers 489 and 824 from Queensland Department
    of Primary Industries Forest Service) between September 1992 and August 1993,
    or between December 1994 and August 1995, except for those of Alphitonia whitei
    and Timonius timon which were taken from specimens in the QRS herbarium. Sampling
    was often from one fruiting individual. The basic sample was of 10 seeds or 10
    fruits, taken haphazardly across the whole size range available. The sample was
    often increased to 20-50 seeds for species of seed dry mass < 50 mg, and always
    to > 50 for seeds of mean dry mass <1 mg. Only apparently healthy seeds were collected.
    All seeds were cleaned and dried for at least 48 h at 80 'C; dry mass values were
    deter- mined for single seeds or known numbers of seeds on an electronic balance
    to a precision of 0.1 mg. The mean values quoted have been rounded off to two
    sig- nificant figures. In most species for which dry mass values of single seeds
    were determined the largest had a value two to three times that of the smallest.
    In a wider-ranging study of seed size in NEQ we"have made two collections of 10
    seeds at different sites or different times for each of 24 species. For two species
    (one reported in Table 1) the collections differed in mean dry mass by a factor
    of three to four; in the other 22 cases the difference between the first mean
    and the overall mean was 14 ? 2.5% (SE; range 0-37%).

questions:
  contributor: The data file includes a single entry, yet there are many
    species seed masses given in the manuscript. Is there a reason these are not
    included in Austraits? Also, do you have coordinates for where the data were collected?
additional_traits: The manuscript also includes data on shade tolerance.
