  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: The site was selected based on needing an area with at least
    5 co-occurring species with varying leaf forms.
  original_file: Leaf herbivory datasheet_Mark Ooi_Sydney.xlsx with two sheets 'Herbivory'
    and 'Other data'. Data from both sheets combined using custom r code.
