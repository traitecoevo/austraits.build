    savanna sites

  sampling_strategy: The Desert Uplands biogeographical region covers ~75,000 km2
    (Fig. 1, Thackway and Creswell 1995) and is characterised by low altitude Tertiary
    plateau with well-developed sand-sheets. Climate is semi-arid with highly variable
    seasonal rainfall mostly from November to March. Mean annual rainfall at Jericho
    in the southern Desert Uplands is 516 mm with 71 % falling in summer between October
    and March (Clewett et al. 1994). Summer and winter daily maximum temperatures
    are 30-35 deg C and 20-25 deg C, respectively (Fairfax and Fensham 2000). The
    area is prone to occasional severe drought (Fensham and Holman 1999). Each of
    four cleared-uncleared site pairs was located in Eucalyptus melanophloia open
    woodland with a sparse canopy on undulating sand plains (Queensland regional ecosystem
    10.5.5a; EPA 2007; http://www.epa.qld.gov.au/media/nature_conservation/ biodiversity/desert_uplands/Factsheets/100505.htm).
    This regional ecosystem (hereafter 'E. melanophloia savanna') dominates large
    areas of the Desert Uplands bioregion and harbours relatively high plant species
    diversity and high to very high animal species diversity (Thompson et al. 2003).
    Besides dominant Eucalyptus melanophloia, common trees were Eucalyptus populnea,
    Acacia species and Proteaceae. Common native grasses were sampled including Aristida
    jerichoensis, Bothriochloa ewartiana, Heteropogon contortus, Themeda triandra
    and Triodia pungens. ^p Eucalyptus dominated savannas have been extensively cleared
    with the intention to enhance pasture growth. Typically savanna is cleared by
    chain pulling the woody vegetation and burning 1 to 2 years after clearing. Fertilisers
    are not used. Clearing is usually followed by sowing the exotic pasture grass
    Cenchrus ciliaris (buffelgrass), but establishment success is variable. The study
    sites were selected to represent a chronosequence of 1.5-, 2-, 10- and 30-year
    old cleared sites of E. melanophloia savanna. The 1.5- year cleared (23deg50'S,
    146deg08'E) and 10-year cleared sites (23deg50'S, 146deg05'E) were situated on
    grazing property Summerdell, and the 2-year (23deg24'S, 146deg 30'E) and 30-year
    cleared sites (23deg26'S, 146deg30'E) were situated on grazing property Monklands
    (Fig. 1). Buffelgrass was present at cleared sites but was not the dominant grass
    species. Cleared sites had some resprouts of E. melanophloia which were multistemmed
    and up to 3 m tall. Sites were selected in adjacent uncleared savanna after field
    inspection suggested compatible soil types. Uncleared sites for comparison were
    grazed savanna remnants between 2.2 and 10 ha in size and at more than 0.5 km
    distance to cattle watering points.
