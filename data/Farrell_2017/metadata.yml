  description: This study evaluated 17 species from seasonally dry habitats, representing
    a range of life-forms, under well-watered and drought conditions, to determine
    how water potential at the turgor loss point relates to stomatal sensitivity and
    drought strategy.
  collection_type: glasshouse
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: Species selection ^p  To determine differences in drought response
    between lifeforms, which grow in seasonally dry habitats, we selected 20 species
    with five different life-forms from four different habitats with restricted water
    availability because of shallow or very free-draining soils with low water holding
    capacity. These habitats included rock outcrop, inland woodland, coastal dune
    and rocky grassland plant communities from across south-eastern Australia (Victoria;
    Table 1). Following establishment, the 20 species were reduced to 17 on account
    of obligate dormancy in two of the geophytes and loss of one herb species due
    to poor establishment. These 17 species were then unevenly distributed between
    the life-forms with the following, two geophytes; four grass-like monocots; three
    herbs; four prostrate shrubs; and four small shrubs (<1mtall). Table 1 describes
    the habitat, life-form and mean annual aridity index for natural range (Atlas
    of Living Australiain press) of each species. Based on their minimum aridity indices
    (Table 1), all species were distributed in areas considered semi-arid (0.2-0.5)
    or arid (0.03-0.2) (UNEP 1997). ^p    Plants were obtained as 6-month-old seedlings
    from commercial nurseries. In early spring (September 2011), 15 plants of uniform
    size of each species were planted into 4 L black plastic containers (200 mm diameter,
    190 mm height) containing 3.5 kg of a scoria-based substrate (60% aerolite black
    scoria 8 mm minus blockmix; 20% 7 mm red scoria aggregate and 20% coir) with a
    water holding capacity of 46% and a bulk density of 1.26 g cm_3 (Farrell et al.
    2013a). Twelve grams of low phosphorous slow release fertilizer [Osmocote plus,
    Scotts Australia Pty Ltd.; 16 nitrogen (N):1.3 phosphorus (P):9.1 potassium (K)]
    were added to the surface of each pot 1 week post-planting. Plants were grown
    in a glasshouse at the Burnley Campus, University of Melbourne, at an average
    temperature of 23 degC during the experiment. All plants were watered to pot capacity
    twice a week before the start of the experiment in mid-summer (January 2012).
    ^p    Experimental design  ^p    Five plants of each species were randomly allocated
    to two treatments, well-watered (WW) and drought (D). The remaining five plants
    were harvested at the start of the experiment to obtain initial fresh weights.
    An additional 10 substrate-only pots were used to determine evaporation rates
    from WWand D treatments during the experiment (five pots per treatment). Pots
    were arranged in a complete randomized block design (five blocks). The experiment
    ran for 73 d, between late-January (mid-summer) and mid-April (midautumn). WW
    plants were watered twice weekly (Monday and Thursday) to pot capacity (2 L per
    pot) while each pot in the drought treatment was dried out to approximately 10%
    SWC before being rewatered to pot capacity and again left to dry out. This cycle
    of drying and rewatering was repeated for 6 weeks before plants were left to dry
    out without further rewatering. All physiological measures were collected during
    the final dry down period for each species

questions:
  contributor: The taxon 'Senna nemophila' does not appear on either the APC or APNI
    lists. Other websites give 'Cassia nemophila' as a synonym, which is then matched
    by APC to 'Senna artemisioides subsp. x coriacea'. Is this the same species?
