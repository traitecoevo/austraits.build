  description: A dataset compiled to determine whether life-history characters that
    affect population persistence (e.g. habit and life span) and those that influence
    reproductive success (e.g. sexual system and fruit type) are non-randomly correlated
    with extinction risk (i.e. threat category) in the Australian flora.
  collection_type: literature compilation
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: EXTANT FLORA To begin we compiled a list of the flowering plant
    families for Australia (n = 222 families) and determined the number of species
    in each family by consulting Hnatiuk (1990), and, when it became available, the
    online version, the Australian Plant Name Index, http://www.anbg.gov.au/cgi-bin/apni.
    We checked the number of species and revised the counts when more recent treatments
    became available, for example from the Flora of Australia volumes, regional floras,
    or other taxonomic treatments. Family names were ultimately delineated following
    the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group classification (Stevens, 2001 onwards). ENDANGERED
    AND EXTINCT FLORA There is much discussion about the membership and robustness
    of threatened species lists (Akcakaya et al., 2000; Burgman, 2002; Possingham
    et al., 2002; Keith & Burgman, 2004). Our list of extinct and endangered species
    was derived from the schedules within the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity
    Act 1999 (EPBC Act) as of November 2003. This group of species was considered
    by us to represent species most likely to be extinct or to go extinct in the next
    10-20 years. We refer to these species as rare because they variously occur within
    the seven forms of rarity as proposed by Rabinowitz (1981). There are many thousands
    more species considered as rare in threatened species classifications in Australia
    (e.g. Briggs & Leigh, 1996), but these are generally not considered to be at a
    high risk of extinction in the next 10 years and are not considered separately
    in this study. To verify the accuracy of Australian taxa listed as presumed extinct,
    we sought collection and taxonomic information for 61 taxa. In particular, an
    attempt was made to find the protologue, additional descriptive material, and
    the most recent sighting or collection date for each taxon presumed extinct. Only
    flowering species were considered. We then only listed a species as extinct if
    (1) it was taxonomically distinct (if the species is known only from a single
    specimen, it was placed in the 'known only from the type' category and not considered
    further), (2) no collections or sightings of the species are known within the
    last 50 years, and (3) the species is not extant outside Australia. No additional
    checking was performed on the validity of membership on the endangered list except
    to exclude nonvascular taxa and taxa below the species level or to revise a name
    according to the latest systematic information. LIFE-HISTORY CHARACTERS In order
    to develop a set of testable hypotheses for investigating the significance of
    the trends observed within the extinct and endangered flora, against the extant
    flora as a whole, we assayed four life-history characters for 31 extinct species,
    450 endangered species and for the Australian angiosperms, which totalled 18,821
    species (including 1997 introduced species). We only included taxa at the species
    level. We looked at four life-history characters for each family, habit, life
    span, sex system and fruit type. When all species within a family shared the same
    combination of life-history characters (see below), the data were tallied at the
    family level for the number of species known to occur in the family. For example,
    if all species within a family were hermaphroditic, annual, herbs with capsules,
    the character data were tallied along with a count for the number of species in
    the family and individual species were not looked at in detail. For families where
    categories varied within a lifehistory character (e.g. some species were hermaphroditic
    and other were dioecious), we looked at the life-history characters at the generic
    level and if these were consistent we tallied them; otherwise, we examined life-history
    characters for each individual species. To determine which category within a character
    a species exhibited, we sourced the information in the first instance either from
    the Flora of Australia volumes, or from Morley & Toelken (1983), or from regional
    botanical reference texts (a list is available from the authors). If we were not
    able to obtain the information from these sources, we gathered and queried information
    from published taxonomic treatments, researchers, protologues or herbarium specimens.
    For some species we were unable to determine every life-history character. In
    these cases we omitted from the analyses that lifehistory character for that species
    (habit data were lacking for 129 spp., life span for 135 spp., sex system for
    192 spp., and fruit type for 34 spp.).

questions:
  contributor: Do you have a current email address and affiliation for Anne Sjostrom?
  question2: Your key for 'sex system 4' was 'bisexual flowers  other individuals
    flowers on plant are male or  female'. Depending how I read it, I come up with
    either trioecious or polygamodioecious - but both of those are already under other
    numbers.
