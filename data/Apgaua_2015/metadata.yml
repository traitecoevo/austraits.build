  description: Using a multi-disciplinary approach, this study examined the hydraulic
    variability in trees in a lowland tropical rainforest in north-eastern Australia.
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: Our study site is located in a one-hectare permanent plot in
    lowland tropical rainforest at the Daintree Rainforest Observatory, Cape Tribulation
    (16deg 06' 20'', 145deg 26' 40'') in north-eastern Australia. We selected seven
    common eudicot and one monocot palm (>8 tree stems/ha >10 cm DBH), representing
    different functional groups (Table 1). These species belong to different genera
    and families, thereby preventing bias due to close phylogenetic relatedness. For
    brevity, we henceforth refer to our study species by their genus. We sampled four
    mature individuals (>60% potential height) of each species, with the exception
    of Castanospermum for which resources limited sampling to two individuals. Our
    sample selection was complemented with a canopy crane assessment to ensure that
    we selected individuals with well-illuminated crowns, that were not overtopped
    by other species, and which had limited liana load. In the case of Myristica,
    which is an understorey tree, all the individuals we selected were partially overtopped
    by canopy trees (60% to 70% crown exposed). However the variation in crown exposure
    of the four selected individuals was minimal, and in all cases well-illuminated
    branches were accessible by the crane.

  methods: We obtained sap flow measurements by the heat ratio method using commercially
    available sap flow meters (Model, SFM1; ICT International). The sap flow meters
    were installed at 1.3 m height on the bole, with the exception of buttressed trees
    (Argyrodendron) on which the devices were installed 50 cm above the buttress.
    Sap flow data was used for a four to nine day time window at the end of the dry
    season in November 2013 as this coincided with a period where all equipment was
    functioning simultaneously. The total rainfall for the nine-day period was 27
    mm, and there was no rainfall recorded for a week prior to this. Meteorological
    data was obtained from the Bureau of Meteorology for the Cape Tribulation Store
    weather station (no. 31012), which is < 1 km northeast of the study site. For
    each individual, we computed the mean maximum rates of sap flow and sap velocities
    over four to nine complete days. From the vessel areas and cross sectional areas
    of digital images, we computed the vessel fraction (VF = VA - VD, total cross-sectional
    area used for sap transport). The idealized vessel diameters (Vdia) was calculated
    for each species and we used the Hagen-Poiseuille equation to calculate the theoretical
    specific xylem hydraulic conductivity (henceforth theoretical specific conductivity)
    as, Ks = pi/128nA[cross sectional area] x SD4, where n is the viscosity (1.002
    x 10-9 MPa s-1) and p is the density of water (998.23 kg m-3) respectively at
    20 deg C. We also derived a vulnerability index (VI = Vdia/VD, susceptibility
    to cavitation) for each individual. (Note, these units are different from those
    reported in the manuscript. Other studies in AusTraits have used the same formula
    to calculate these values, but then adjusted them to be comparable to Ks (not
    theoretical), and the same was done to merge this dataset into AusTraits; that
    is, the units used are '10^6 x kg/m/s/MPa' versus 'kg/s/MPa' in the manuscript.)

  methods: Two cores, each ca. 5 cm long, were obtained with an increment corer from
    each individual tree at breast height. We measured using callipers the depth of
    sapwood, which was determined visually by a colour change in the sapwood/heartwood
    interface. We used this to calculate sapwood area by subtracting the cross-sectional
    area of the non-sapwood area from that of the trunk (excluding bark). "Sapwood
    area" for Normanbya was calculated from the entire crosssectional area of the
    palm stem at 1.3 m DBH, excluding the bark. Due to the hard wood, coring for sapwood
    samples was also not feasible for Normanbya. We therefore collected wood wedge
    samples at 1.3 m DBH from Normanbya individuals of a similar diameter to those
    used in sap flow measurements. The sapwood samples were sanded and polished with
    increasing grits of sanding paper until anatomical structures were visible. Sapwood
    vessels from the first two centimeters of sapwood towards the bark were examined
    with a stereo microscope (30x magnification; Nikon SMZ 745T) and photographed
    (Nikon DS-Fi2). On the digital photographs, vessels were measured for area (vessel
    area, VA) and density (vessel density, VD) using imaging software GIMP 2.8.10.

    For leaf area, leaf slenderness (defined as the ratio of the leaf length to leaf
    breadth), leaf mass per area (LMA) and leaf dry matter content (LDMC), five to
    20 replicates per individual of sun-exposed leaves were obtained from the tree
    canopy. For the compound-leaved Castanospermum, leaflets were taken to be the
    functional unit equivalent to leaves. Leaf areas were obtained from scans processed
    in imaging software GIMP. These leaves were weighed fresh and then weighed after
    drying 60 deg C for a week. LMA was the ratio of leaf dry weight to oven dried
    mass and LDMC was leaf dry mass divided by fresh mass.
