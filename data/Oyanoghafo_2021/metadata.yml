  description: A study comparing the cavitation resistance of Hakea species that differ
    in life history and climatic niches to investigate what attributes are predictive
    of aridity.
  basis_of_record: captive_cultivated
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: Experimental design and species selection ^p All samples were
    collected from the Australian Botanic Garden (ABG), Mount Annan, NSW, Australia
    [GPS location, latitude -34.0703, longitude 150.7668, average annual rainfall
    of 759 mm (2007-016)] and were well watered via irrigation systems (simulating
    a common garden design). Comparing multiple species from the same Hakea genus
    in a common garden minimizes environmental effects and allows quantification of
    genetically determined trait variation. Using this approach, we examined the variation
    in functional traits and vulnerability to xylem cavitation traits of a diverse
    array of species sampled from across the Hakea phylogeny (Cardillo et al., 2017).
    A total of 16 species were selected to represent a wide range of vegetation type,
    biome, climate and life histories (Table 1). Species occurrence records were downloaded
    from the Australian Living Atlas (https://www.ala.org.au/, 2019). Life history
    traits (resprouting ability and leaf form) were obtained from published flora,
    such as Flora of Australia, and field observations. Vegetation type was defined
    according to the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) as abbreviated by Cardillo et al. (2017),
    arid (deserts and xeric shrublands), Mediterranean (Mediterranean forests, woodlands
    and scrub), forest (temperate broadleaf and mixed forests) and grasslands (temperate
    grasslands, savannas and shrublands). The vegetation harbouring >50 % of the species
    occurrence records was assigned as its vegetation type (Cardillo et al., 2017).
    Biome was defined based on the aridity index (AI; UNEP, 1997) as broadly humid
    and arid (AI >0.5 and <0.5, respectively). The climate summary details for each
    species distribution were obtained from The Atlas of Living Australia using R
    v3.6.3 (R Core Team, 2020). ^p Sampling of plant material ^p Three individuals
    for each species were sampled from the above-ground biomass. Terminal full sunlight,
    north-facing branches that were approx. 90 cm long were sampled and placed into
    a black plastic bag with wet tissue paper and transported immediately to the laboratory
    (<90 min). Samples were stored in a cold room at 4 °C until they were processed
    (within 10 d).

  methods: Cavitation resistance was determined by inducing embolism in the xylem
    using the centrifuge method and according to Cochard et al. (2013, 2005). This
    advanced centrifuge technique creates centrifugal force that generates tension
    in the branch xylem vessels to induce cavitation in a branch segment, thereby
    allowing measurement of xylem percentage loss of conductivity at set points of
    tension. Straight stems, 27 cm in length and with 6 mm basal diameter, were sampled
    and cut under water from the remaining 40 cm long branch segments, placed on the
    custom-built 27cm rotor and spun at different velocities. To control for the artefact
    associated with the centrifuge, initial measurements were obtained at lower pressures
    (-0.5 MPa = 2378 rpm) that did not induce cavitation (López et al., 2019). While
    there are methods for correcting for longer vessel lengths using the CAVITOPEN
    model (Lopez et al., 2019), we have been conservative in only including species
    with xylem vessels <25 cm (noting our 27 cm rotor size). The vessel length ranged
    from 25 cm for species from the arid biome (H. leucoptera) to 10 cm for species
    in the humid biome (H. dactyloides) (López et al., 2019). The percentage loss
    of conductance (PLC) at negative xylem pressure (tension) was automatically recorded
    through a step-wise increase (1000 rpm each) at approx. 2 min stabilization time
    (Zhang et al., 2017) until 90-95 % loss of conductivity was attained. At each
    new xylem pressure (tension), hydraulic conductance (Kh) was measured from 30
    repeated measures. A fifty per cent loss of conductance (P50) and the slope were
    obtained from the vulnerability curve using the 'fitplc' R package (Duursma and
    Choat, 2017).

    cut under water from the terminal end of the collected samples, from which the
    bottom 10 cm was excised, bark removed to estimate the sap flow area and then
    oven-dried to obtain the WD (oven-dry mass/volume). All leaves were removed from
    the remaining 40 cm branch, and leaf area was measured using the Li-Cor 3100 leaf
    area meter (LI-COR, Lincoln, NE, USA). Leaf material was oven-dried at 70 °C for
    48 h prior to obtaining the dry mass. The SLA (mm2 mg-1) was obtained by dividing
    the total leaf area by the leaf oven-dry mass. The ratio of the sapwood area to
    leaf area was described as the HV.

questions:
  question1: Prior to adding this dataset the highest wood density was 1.26 mg/mm3
    (out of 10,000+ entries). Given that some of your values are 3-4 times larger
    than this I am wondering if there is something unusual about the method you used?
    Hakea species of course have dense wood, but these values are really very high
    - and most of your data is filtered out of AusTraits because we've set the maximum
    allowed value at 1.4 mg/mm3.
  question2: Could you also provide data for P88?
