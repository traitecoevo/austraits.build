  description: Dataset of diurnal and seasonal patterns of leaf gas exchange and water
    relations in tree species of contrasting leaf phenology growing in a seasonally
    dry tropical rain forest in north-eastern Australia.
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: 'STUDY SITE The study was undertaken in 2000 and 2001 at Many
    Peaks Range (19 deg 11min S, 145deg 45min E) on the north-eastern coast of Australia.
    The climate is characterized by marked inter- and intraannual variation in rainfall.
    Mean annual rainfall at the study site is 1100 mm with over 80% of this rainfall
    usually occurring during the summer wet season (December-March). Annual rainfall
    differed markedly between the two years of study (Figure 2). Although total rainfall
    in 2000 (2400 mm) was more than double the long-term mean annual rainfall and
    rainfall in 2001 was less than half the mean (467 mm), rainfall totals for the
    two wet seasons during the field study were more similar than annual totals. Rainfall
    totalled 1517 and 906 mm, respectively, for the 1999-2000 and 2000-2001 wet seasons.
    The unusually high rainfall in 2000 was due to Tropical Cyclone Tessa and subsequent
    heavy rains that occurred in April. PLANT SPECIES Two drought-deciduous species,
    Brachychiton australis (Schott and Endl.) A. Terracc. and Cochlospermum gillivraei
    Benth., and two evergreen species, Alphitonia excelsa (Fenzal) Benth. and Austromyrtus
    bidwillii (Benth.) Burret were studied. All species are common at the study site
    although C. gillivraei and A. excelsa also occur in surrounding savanna vegetation.
    Three of the study species occurred in open areas that received full sunlight:
    two deciduous trees, B. australis and C. gillivraei, and the evergreen A. excelsa.
    The remaining evergreen species, A. bidwillii, is a sub-canopy tree.'

  methods: Leaf gas exchange, leaf water potential and canopy area were measured in
    three seasonal periods, the wet season (November-March), the transition from wet
    season to dry season (April-June) and the dry season (July-October). Wet and dry
    season measurements were made in March and August 2000, respectively. However,
    measurements for the wet to dry transitional period were postponed until May of
    2001 because of a tropical cyclone that struck the study site in April 2000. Four
    replicate trees of each species were selected for study. Measurements were made
    on one individual of each species per day over four clear, sunny days. Before
    each field trip, five mature, fully expanded leaves were tagged for gas exchange
    experiments on each of the 16 trees. All tagged leaves were north facing to maximize
    exposure to sunlight. Diurnal patterns of leaf gas exchange parameters and leaf
    water potential were monitored with measurements made at 0500, 0900, 1100, 1300,
    1500 and 1700 h. Carbon dioxide assimilation rate and gs were measured on the
    five tagged leaves on each tree with an LCA4 infrared gas analysis (IRGA) system
    (Analytical Development Corp, Hoddesdon, U.K.). All gas exchange measurements
    were made in ambient conditions and the leaf temperature, air temperature and
    photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) at the leaf surface were recorded at
    each measurement by the LCA4. The leaf to air vapor pressure difference (LAVPD)
    was calculated from leaf temperature and atmospheric vapor pressure. Concurrent
    measurements of leaf water potential were made on three similarly displayed leaves
    from each tree with a Scholander-type pressure chamber (Plant Moisture Stress,
    Corvallis, OR). An additional series of leaf water potential measurements were
    made during the late dry season (September 2001). Total leaf area was estimated
    in the same individuals used for gas exchange and water relations measurements
    during each seasonal period. Seasonal changes in leaf area were measured in four
    replicates of each species by the randomized branch sampling method (Gregoire
    et al. 1995). Five random pathways were determined by probability sampling for
    each individual tree. Each pathway commenced at the base of the tree and proceeded
    acropetally to a terminal branch, which was harvested for measurement of leaf
    area. Branches harvested from each pathway were taken to the laboratory where
    the leaf area distal to the branch was measured with a CI-203 leaf area meter
    (CID, Camas, WA).

    with a microtome blade. The blocks were airdried and coatedwith gold before observation
    under a scanning electron microscope (SEM) (Cambridge S360, Oxford Instruments,
    Oxford, UK). Measurements of xylem vessel diameter were made from micrographs
    using Scion image analysis software (Scion, National Institute of Health, Bethesda
    MD). At least 50 vessels were measured for each sample observed, and the number
    of vessels per square millimetre was counted. Vessel diameters were divided into
    10 um size classes for each species to give the frequency distribution of vessel
    diameters. To determine the contribution of each vessel size class to the hydraulic
    conductance of the stem, the radii of vessels in each size class were raised to
    the fourth power (Hagan-Poiseuille Law) and summed.

  methods: Hydraulic conductivity (Kh), specific conductivity (Ks) and leaf specific
    conductivity (KL) were determined for stem segments during the wet season using
    an apparatus similar to that described by Sperry et al. (1988). The maximum vessel
    length of each species was determined by air injection into stem segments at a
    pressure of 0.1 MPa. The distal ends of the segments were immersed in water and
    cut back in 1 cm sections until bubbles were seen to appear (Zimmermann and Jeje
    1981). For measurements of hydraulic conductivity, branches between 10-30 mm in
    diameter whose length exceeded the longest vessel were collected in the field
    prior to dawn, and transported to the laboratory in sealed plastic bags containing
    wet tissue paper. Stem segments were re-cut under tap water to a length that remained
    longer than maximum vessel length, shaved at both ends with a sharp razor blade
    and transferred quickly to the apparatus. The segments were flushed with perfusing
    solution (degassed 10mMKCl, pH 6.7, filtered to 0.22 um) for 30min at 100 kPa.
    This solutionwas chosen in order to minimise the hydrogel response of angiosperm
    pit membranes (Zwieniecki et al. 2001). Measurements of Kh were then made with
    a gravity induced, low pressure (~10 kPa) application of solution from a secondary
    reservoir. Hydraulic conductivity (Kh, kg s-1 MPa-1 m) was calculated from Kh=F/(delta
    P/L), where F is mass flow rate (kg s-1) and deltaP is pressure drop (MPa) along
    the length of the stem segment (L) in metres. After measurement, the stem was
    removed from the apparatus and the sapwood area was measured for determination
    of Ks (Ks=Kh/Ax where Ax is transverse area of sapwood in m2). The leaf area distal
    to the stem segmentwasmeasured with a CI-203 leaf area meter (CID, Camas, WA)
    for determination of KL (KL=Kh/Al where Al is distal leaf area in m2). The Huber
    value (HV) was determined as the ratio of transverse area of sapwood to the distal
    leaf area.

    value (HV) was determined as the ratio of transverse area of sapwood to the distal
    leaf area.

  methods: Hydraulic conductivity (Kh), specific conductivity (Ks) and leaf specific
    conductivity (KL) were determined for stem segments during the wet season using
    an apparatus similar to that described by Sperry et al. (1988). The maximum vessel
    length of each species was determined by air injection into stem segments at a
    pressure of 0.1 MPa. The distal ends of the segments were immersed in water and
    cut back in 1 cm sections until bubbles were seen to appear (Zimmermann and Jeje
    1981). For measurements of hydraulic conductivity, branches between 10-30 mm in
    diameter whose length exceeded the longest vessel were collected in the field
    prior to dawn, and transported to the laboratory in sealed plastic bags containing
    wet tissue paper. Stem segments were re-cut under tap water to a length that remained
    longer than maximum vessel length, shaved at both ends with a sharp razor blade
    and transferred quickly to the apparatus. The segments were flushed with perfusing
    solution (degassed 10mMKCl, pH 6.7, filtered to 0.22 um) for 30min at 100 kPa.
    This solutionwas chosen in order to minimise the hydrogel response of angiosperm
    pit membranes (Zwieniecki et al. 2001). Measurements of Kh were then made with
    a gravity induced, low pressure (~10 kPa) application of solution from a secondary
    reservoir. Hydraulic conductivity (Kh, kg s-1 MPa-1 m) was calculated from Kh=F/(delta
    P/L), where F is mass flow rate (kg s-1) and deltaP is pressure drop (MPa) along
    the length of the stem segment (L) in metres. After measurement, the stem was
    removed from the apparatus and the sapwood area was measured for determination
    of Ks (Ks=Kh/Ax where Ax is transverse area of sapwood in m2). The leaf area distal
    to the stem segmentwasmeasured with a CI-203 leaf area meter (CID, Camas, WA)
    for determination of KL (KL=Kh/Al where Al is distal leaf area in m2). The Huber
    value (HV) was determined as the ratio of transverse area of sapwood to the distal
    leaf area.

  methods: vessel length; Sapwood characteristics were determined for branches 10-30
    mm in diameter. Three branch samples were taken from three replicate trees of
    each species. Blocks of sapwood were cut from the branches and the transverse
    surfaces were hand planed with a microtome blade. The blocks were airdried and
    coatedwith gold before observation under a scanning electron microscope (SEM)
    (Cambridge S360, Oxford Instruments, Oxford, UK). Measurements of xylem vessel
    diameter were made from micrographs using Scion image analysis software (Scion,
    National Institute of Health, Bethesda MD). At least 50 vessels were measured
    for each sample observed, and the number of vessels per square millimetre was
    counted. Vessel diameters were divided into 10 um size classes for each species
    to give the frequency distribution of vessel diameters. To determine the contribution
    of each vessel size class to the hydraulic conductance of the stem, the radii
    of vessels in each size class were raised to the fourth power (Hagan-Poiseuille
    Law) and summed.
