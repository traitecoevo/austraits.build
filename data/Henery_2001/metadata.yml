  description: seed mass components dataset compiled by Wright And Henery
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: Annual fruit production data for six randomly selected reproductively
    mature individuals per species at each site were collected over a period of 12
    months as the fruit matured. Data from 47 species in 14 families were included
    in the analyses.
  original_file: Henery's data from 'Wright & Henery seed mass data.xls' combined
    with Henery's accessory cost data from the referenced journal article. The data.csv
    file also includes seed count and RE data.
  notes: none

    georeference remarks: 'Data were collected from six sites in Kuringgai National Park:
      Perimeter Track, 33deg 39min 40secS, 151deg 11min 26sec S; Murrua Track (Woodland),
      33deg 40min 53sec S, 151deg 8min 50secS; Chase Trail (Woodland), 33deg 41min
      7sec S, 151deg 7 min 51sec S; Long Track, 33deg 38min 25secS, 151deg 10min 58secS;
      Chase Trail (Heath), 33 deg 41min45secS, 151 deg 6min 38secS; Murrua Track (Heath),
      33 deg 40min58secS, 151 deg 8min 38sec S. The coordinates for the Chase Trail
      are given as an approximate location. All values reported are multi-site means
      across sites. Which species were sampled at which sites is recorded in the file

    description: Sites were widely separated level surfaces with similar (9-11 yr)
      elapsed time since the last fire and with a common soil type derived from a
      geology of underlying Hawkesbury sandstone. These soils are depauperate in nutrients,
      notably phosphorus (Beadle 1962). The vegetation was a fire prone mixture of
      low heath and dry sclerophyll woodland with a species-rich (Rice and Westoby
      1983) understorey of woody shrubs primarily from the families Proteaceae, Fabaceae
      and Myrtaceae. Only three species (genus Persoonia) had fleshy fruits, the remainder
      comprising relatively dry dehiscent woody follicles, legumes, capsules and schizocarps.Sites
      were chosen with a high proportion of species in common, since the aim was to
      replicate each species across two or three sites, as well as to replicate individuals
      within each site.

  methods: In this study seed mass was defined as diaspore minus any dispersal structures.
    Dispersal structures were included with aborted seeds, fruit pulp and seed pods
    and collectively termed accessory costs (measured in grams). Reproductive production
    over one year for each species included all dry mass produced by the female parent
    after pollination and was calculated from the sum of total mass of seed produced
    plus mass of total accessory costs. Accessory costs as quantified here did not
    include flower structures, nectar or pollen production.
