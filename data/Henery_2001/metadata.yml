  description: seed mass components dataset compiled by Wright And Henery
  collection_type: laboratory
  sample_age_class: .na
  sampling_strategy: Annual fruit production data for six randomly selected reproductively
    mature individuals per species at each site were collected over a period of 12
    months as the fruit matured. Data from 47 species in 14 families were included
    in the analyses.

  Chase_Trail:
    longitude (deg): 151.1308333
    latitude (deg): -33.6852778
    description: Sites were widely separated level surfaces with similar (9–11 yr)
      elapsed time since the last fire and with a common soil type derived from a
      geology of underlying Hawkesbury sandstone. These soils are depauperate in nutrients,
      notably phosphorus (Beadle 1962). The vegetation was a fire prone mixture of
      low heath and dry sclerophyll woodland with a species-rich (Rice and Westoby
      1983) understorey of woody shrubs primarily from the families Proteaceae, Fabaceae
      and Myrtaceae. Only three species (genus Persoonia) had fleshy fruits, the remainder
      comprising relatively dry dehiscent woody follicles, legumes, capsules and schizocarps.
      Sites were chosen with a high proportion of species in common, since the aim
      was to replicate each species across two or three sites, as well as to replicate
      individuals within each site.

  methods: In this study seed mass was defined as diaspore minus any dispersal structures.
    Dispersal structures were included with aborted seeds, fruit pulp and seed pods
    and collectively termed accessory costs (measured in grams). Reproductive production
    over one year for each species included all dry mass produced by the female parent
    after pollination and was calculated from the sum of total mass of seed produced
    plus mass of total accessory costs. Accessory costs as quantified here did not
    include flower structures, nectar or pollen production.
