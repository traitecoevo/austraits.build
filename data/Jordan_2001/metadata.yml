  description: Compilation of habitat and propagule trait data for Tasmanian species,
    that was used to compare dispersal syndromes of species that occur in both Tasmania
    and New Zealand.
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: This work considered all angiosperm species recorded by Buchanan
    (1999) as indigenous to Tasmania, except orchids. For each of these species, the
    following traits were scored, Disjunction, Habit, Habitat, Family, Alpine distribution,
    Dioecy, Disseminule size, Fleshy fruit, Hooked or sticky disseminules, Plumosity,
    and Abundance.

    data folder and GoogleDrive folder
  notes: remarkably little overlap with any other studies for the continuous variables
    - just 34 seed width or length values the same as those in AusTraits, and across
    many studies. These likely really represent independent measurements.

  entity_type: species
  value_type: mode

  replicates: .na
  methods: Dioecious or not. The degree to which self-fertilisation is possible will
    affect a species' capacity to establish new populations through long-distance
    dispersal. This trait does not allow for self-incompatibility because these data
    are not available for many groups of plants
- var_in: fleshy fruit (1=present)
  unit_in: .na
  trait_name: fruit_fleshiness
  entity_type: species
  value_type: mode
  basis_of_value: expert_score

  unit_in: cm
  trait_name: seed_length
  entity_type: species
  value_type: mean
  basis_of_value: measurement
  replicates: .na
  methods: This was scored by placing the species' disseminules into categories, on
    the basis of the log of the product of the longest and shortest dimensions of
    the body of the disseminule, excluding appendages such as plumes or wings. Where
    a species had more than one disseminule type the smaller one was used. The categories
    corresponded to spherical disseminules of <0.237, 0.237-0.422, 0.422-0.752, 0.752-1.33,
    1.33-2.37, 2.37- 4.22 and >4.22 mm. This is related to wind-dispersal ability
    and possibly other dispersal mechanisms. A better measure of wind dispersal would
    be to measure drop rates of disseminules (van der Pijl 1982), but this was not
    practicable for the large number of species considered here. (As used here, 'seed'
    includes endocarps, mericarps and other dry, indehiscent fruit, but fleshy fruit
    are not treated as seeds.)

  methods: This reflects features involved in epizoochory (transport externally on
    animals; van der Pijl 1982). The awns of grasses were not included, although they
    sometimes seem to assist epizoochory (see van der Pijl 1982). However, van der
    Pijl (1982) considered that their primary role was in establishment. In fact,
    large and robust awns (i.e. those with potential for epizoochory) were under-represented
    among the disjunct species (only 14.7% of grasses with robust awns were disjunct
    compared with 18.8% without).
