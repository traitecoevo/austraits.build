  description: Compilation of habitat and propagule trait data for Tasmanian species,
    that was used to compare dispersal syndromes of species that occur in both Tasmania
    and New Zealand.
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: This work considered all angiosperm species recorded by Buchanan
    (1999) as indigenous to Tasmania, except orchids. For each of these species, the
    following traits were scored, Disjunction, Habit, Habitat, Family, Alpine distribution,
    Dioecy, Disseminule size, Fleshy fruit, Hooked or sticky disseminules, Plumosity,
    and Abundance.

  notes: remarkably little overlap with any other studies for the continuous variables - just 34 seed width or length values the same as those in AusTraits, and across many studies. These likely really represent independent measurements.

traits:
- var_in: habit (s=woody, p=perennial herb, a=annual herb)
  unit_in: .na
  trait_name: life_history
  value_type: expert_mean

  methods: Species designated as woody perennial, annual monocot, perennial monocot,
    annual dicot, or perennial dicot herb.

  trait_name: woodiness
  value_type: expert_mean
  replicates: .na
  methods: Species designated as woody perennial, annual monocot, perennial monocot,
    annual dicot, or perennial dicot herb.
- var_in: dioecious (d=dioecious; h=hermaphrodite or monoecious)
  unit_in: .na
  trait_name: mating_system
  value_type: expert_mean
  replicates: .na
  methods: Dioecious or not. The degree to which self-fertilisation is possible will
    affect a species' capacity to establish new populations through long-distance
    dispersal. This trait does not allow for self-incompatibility because these data
    are not available for many groups of plants
- var_in: fleshy fruit (1=present)
  unit_in: .na
  trait_name: fruit_type_botany
  value_type: expert_mean
  replicates: .na
  methods: Expert opinion determining presence or absence of a fleshy fruit
- var_in: seed length (cm)
  unit_in: cm
  trait_name: seed_length
  value_type: expert_mean
  replicates: .na
  methods: This was scored by placing the species' disseminules into categories, on
    the basis of the log of the product of the longest and shortest dimensions of
    the body of the disseminule, excluding appendages such as plumes or wings. Where
    a species had more than one disseminule type the smaller one was used. The categories
    corresponded to spherical disseminules of <0.237, 0.237-0.422, 0.422-0.752, 0.752-1.33,
    1.33-2.37, 2.37- 4.22 and >4.22 mm. This is related to wind-dispersal ability
    and possibly other dispersal mechanisms. A better measure of wind dispersal would
    be to measure drop rates of disseminules (van der Pijl 1982), but this was not
    practicable for the large number of species considered here. (As used here, 'seed' includes endocarps, mericarps and other dry, indehiscent fruit, but fleshy fruit are not treated as seeds.)

- var_in: propagule traits
  unit_in: .na
  trait_name: dispersal_appendage
  value_type: expert_mean
  replicates: .na
  methods: This reflects features involved in epizoochory (transport externally on
    animals; van der Pijl 1982). The awns of grasses were not included, although they
    sometimes seem to assist epizoochory (see van der Pijl 1982). However, van der
    Pijl (1982) considered that their primary role was in establishment. In fact,
    large and robust awns (i.e. those with potential for epizoochory) were under-represented
    among the disjunct species (only 14.7% of grasses with robust awns were disjunct
    compared with 18.8% without).

questions:
  contributor: Under the columns with data for propagule width and propagule length,
    the cell contained "#REF * value" -indicating that the column had been copied
    and pasted from a different spreadsheet, and in the process you'd lost  a link
    to a value. Is it possible to resend the spreadsheet, pasting in the data as "paste
    values"?
  question4: Please confirm you are OK with how I've matched your dispersal appendage
    terms with those in AusTraits. (See e-mail)
