traits:
- var_in: Life form
  unit_in: .na
  trait_name: plant_growth_form
  value_type: expert_mean
  replicates: .na
  methods: H=herb S=shrub T=tree P=prostarte C=climber V=vine F=fern TF=tree fern
    FF=forkfern CM=clubmoss; See original file in raw data folder for extensive reference
    list.
- var_in: Fireresponse
  unit_in: .na
  trait_name: fire_response
  value_type: expert_mean
  replicates: .na
  methods: S=seeder, R=resprouter. r=usually killed but sometimes resprouts, s=usually
    resprouts but sometimes killed; these may indicate a variable response seen by
    one observer, or a conflict between different observers (see comments column).
    When an equal number of references list the species as seeder or resprouter, this
    column reads as 'S/R' and details are given in the comments cloumn. Ideally fire
    response should be defined by mortality >70%=seeder, mortality <30%=resprouter
    [Gill & Bradstock, 1992]. Notes on conflicting or variable regeneration information.
    May indicate response to various fire intensity levels; level of mortality seen;
    a variable fire response seen by one observer within the same species. Some species
    with distinct recordings for both resprouter and seeder have been listed seperately
    as 'fire sensitive/tolerant variety'. See original file in raw data folder for
    extensive reference list.

- var_in: Resprout location
  unit_in: .na
  trait_name: regen_strategy
  value_type: expert_mean
  replicates: .na
  methods: Source of buds for vegetative regenerators. Plum text indicates that the
    source of this information is from the fire response category given by one or
    more references (see Fire Response columns); a- indicates this is an assumption
    based on the species morphology. Where multiple methods are given, seperated by
    & both methods recorded by one observer; seperated by / different methods recorded
    by different observers. Where a category 4 fire response is given without specifying
    root suckers or rhizome, root suckers is listed here. See original file in raw
    data folder for extensive reference list.
- var_in: Seed storage
  unit_in: .na
  trait_name: seed_storage_location
  value_type: expert_mean
  replicates: .na
  methods: The following definitions have been used for seed-bank type. Soil seedbank,
    persistent=some carry over of viable seeds from year to year, transient=no viable
    seeds persist for more than 1 year [Thompson & Grime 1979 JEc 67:893-921]; Canopy
    seedbank, serotinous=most seed retained for a few years (released by fire, death,
    drying over time) [Lamont et al 1991 BotRev 57:277-317] canopy transient=retained
    on plant for short period only. Plum text indicates that the source of this information
    is from the fire response category given by one or more references (see Fire Response
    columns); blue text indicates this is an assumption based on the species morphology.
    See original file in raw data folder for extensive reference list.

  methods: The following definitions have been used for seed-bank type. Soil seedbank,
    persistent=some carry over of viable seeds from year to year, transient=no viable
    seeds persist for more than 1 year [Thompson & Grime 1979 JEc 67:893-921]; Canopy

- var_in: Seed dispersal mechanism
  unit_in: .na
  trait_name: dispersal_syndrome
  value_type: expert_mean
  replicates: .na
  methods: Known vector for dispersal (wind, bird, ants, mammal, adhesion, etc); a-
    indicates seed is adapted for dispersal by the given vector (but not necessarily
    shown to use this vector); ? indicates possible vector. See original file in raw
    data folder for extensive reference list.
- var_in: Germination cue
  unit_in: .na
  trait_name: germination_treatment
  value_type: expert_mean
  replicates: .na
  methods: Germination is stimulated by a fire-related (e.g. heat, smoke) or other
    (e.g. stratification, leaching) cue; a- indicates seed is adapted for given cue
    (ie hard seed coat adapted for heat cue). See original file in raw data folder
    for extensive reference list.
- var_in: flowering_time_edited
  unit_in: .na
  trait_name: flowering_time
  value_type: expert_mean
  replicates: .na
  methods: Main flowering time. From Flora of NSW or Ecology of Sydney Plant Species
    or other source (eg other reference book, recovery plan).
- var_in: fruiting_time_edited
  unit_in: .na
  trait_name: fruiting_time
  value_type: expert_mean
  replicates: .na
  methods: Main fruiting time. See original file in raw data folder for extensive
    reference list.
- var_in: Post-fire recruitment
  unit_in: .na
  trait_name: fire_cued_seeding
  value_type: expert_mean
  replicates: .na
  methods: Indicates whether seedlings have been observed post-fire, may give quantity
    of seedlings seen. 'no' indicates that a reference has categorised this species
    as an 'obligate resprouter'; if one source implies this but another implies that
    seedlings were seen then 'no / yes' is given. See original file in raw data folder
    for extensive reference list.
