  description: A greenhouse experiment that examined nine drought resistance traits
    (six morphological/allocation traits plus assimilation, stomatal conductance and
    water-use efficiency) in well-watered and water-stressed seedlingsof four Brachychiton
    (Malvaceae Juss.) species with ranges spanning a strong aridity gradient in east-central
    Australia
  collection_type: glasshouse
  sample_age_class: seedling
  sampling_strategy: The genus Brachychiton (family Malvaceae) is composed of 31 described
    species, with all but two being Australian endemics (Guymer 1988). Brachychiton
    species have adapted to a range of climates across Australia, from tropical rainforests
    to semi-arid scrublands (AVH 2017). We selected four focal species for this study;
    B. acerifolius, B. discolor, B. populneus and B. rupestris. Adult distributions
    of the focal species show varying degrees of overlap across climate and geographic
    space (Figure 2). However, B. acerifolius and B. discolor (henceforth 'mesic species')
    typically occur in wet rainforests along Australia's eastern coast, whereas B.
    populneus and B. rupestris ('xeric species') occur over a wider precipitation
    gradient extending into Australia's semi-arid interior and are rare in areas of
    very high rainfall (AVH 2017). We determined a hierarchy of drought resistance
    among the four focal species based on their realized hydrological niches. Starting
    with species occurrence records from Australia's Virtual Herbarium (AVH 2017),
    we calculated the mean CMD for each species using gridded climate data obtained
    from WorldClim Global Climate Data (Hijmans et al. 2005) and Gobal Aridity and
    PET Database (Zomer et al. 2008). Species with relatively high CMD should frequently
    experience and tolerate harsher climates (xeric species) than those with low CMD
    (mesic species). The distributions of the four studied Brachychiton species cover
    a considerable amount of climate space (Figure 3), as demonstrated by the distribution
    of species across mean CMD. Drought experiments We tested both constitutive and
    plastic drought resistance mechanisms in seedlings of the four Brachychiton species
    in a greenhouse experiment conducted at the University of Queensland, Australia.
    We germinated seeds sourced from local nurseries and planted seedlings in 100
    x 100 mm plastic pots (one seedling per pot), with a soil mix formulated for Australian
    native plants (Mix UQ23-30% coco peat, 70% composted pine bark). Seedlings were
    deemed established when they had successfully produced at least one pair of true
    leaves (Chippendale 1973). Once a sufficient number of seedlings from all species
    were established (8 weeks after sowing), we initiated the drought experiment.
    At the start of the experiment, we randomly assigned seedlings to either the drought
    or control treatment. In order to avoid confounding plant size (by species) with
    water stress, we determined species-specific water dosages based on gravimetrically
    measured daily transpiration rates (Li 2000). A soil moisture probe was used to
    measure the volume of water-loss when it was too small to be accurately detected
    by weight. More details on calculations used to determine watering levels using
    both gravimetrical measurements and soil moisture probes are provided in Appendix
    1. Seedlings in drought treatments received half of their transpiration requirements
    every second day, amounting to a quarter of their full requirements for the duration
    of the experiment. Seedlings in control treatments received their full transpiration
    requirements at similar intervals until the conclusion of the experiment (72 days
    from start of treatments). Depending on germination success, each treatment was
    applied to 6-12 individuals of each species (except for B. discolor control, which
    only had four individuals due to mid-experiment mortality, see Appendix 2).

  methods: Leaf Dry Matter Content - the leaf dry mass of a plant divided by the wet
    mass;  After LICOR measurements were taken, all plants were harvested. They were
    then rehydrated for 24 h using the partial rehydration method (Vaieretti et al.
    2007), after which leaf areas were measured using a LI-COR Biosciences, Inc.,
    Lincoln, NE, USA 3100 C Area Meter. To measure dry biomass, all plant parts were
    placed in a drying oven at 60 deg C for 72 h and then leaves, roots and stems
    were weighed separately.

    using a LI-COR Biosciences, Inc., Lincoln, NE, USA 6400XT Portable Photosynthesis
    System on Day 72 of the experiment between 11:00 and 14:00 h. Constant CO2 (400
    umol mol-1) and light (1900 umol m-2 s-1) values were used alongside ambient humidity
    (65-75%) and temperature (25.8-26.3 deg C) for all plant measurements. In instances
    where leaf size did not cover the whole cuvette, sampled leaf area was quantified
    by tracing the leaf and using ImageJ to calculate the area of the outline, and
    a leaf area correction applied to the gas exchange measurements. WUE is calculated
    as A/Gs.
