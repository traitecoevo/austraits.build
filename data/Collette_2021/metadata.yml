  description: Investigation of how variation in the distribution of dormancy classes
    is correlated with regional environmental factors, in particular rainfall seasonality
    and temperature.
  basis_of_record: literature
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: Study areas from temperate Australia were chosen based on the
    criteria that (1) they had either seasonal or aseasonal rainfall, and (2) they
    had similar fire-prone vegetation. The study areas were defined via the Köppen
    classification system and then using rainfall data from the Australian Bureau
    of Meteorology to assess rainfall distribution at the local scale. This led to
    four study areas being selected, two from each type of rainfall climate, in four
    states of Australia (Köppen classes in parentheses), the south-western coast of
    Western Australia (WA) (Csa/Csb) and the Lower Eyre Peninsula of South Australia
    (SA) (Csb) (both seasonal or Mediterranean-climate rainfall), and the eastern
    New South Wales (NSW) and the north-east coast of Tasmania (TAS) (both Cfb with
    aseasonal rainfall). From here on, study areas are referred to as the states that
    they belong to (WA, SA, NSW and TAS). Each study area was assigned a mean annual
    minimum temperature and rainfall seasonality index (RSI) from a central point
    within their boundaries. Mean minimum annual temperatures were obtained from Australian
    Bureau of Meteorology station data while the annual RSI was obtained from the
    Atlas of Living Australia (https://spatial.ala.org.au/layers, https://researchdata.edu.au/annual-rainfall-seasonality-index).
    The index is derived from the ratio of southern hemisphere warm (Oct-Nov-Dec-Jan-Feb-Mar)
    to cool (Apr-May-Jun-Jul-Aug-Sep) season rainfall totals (minus 1). It produces
    positive values when rainfall in the warm season is greater than rainfall in the
    cool season. The ratio of cool to warm season rainfall totals (plus 1) are assigned
    negative values when rainfall in the cool season is greater than rainfall in the
    warm season. ^p Using the Australasian Virtual Herbarium (AVH), an online resource
    that combines specimen data from herbaria around Australia and New Zealand, lists
    of shrub species occurring within each area were generated. Within the AVH, for
    each study area we used a spatial filter of different botanical sub-divisions
    that occurred within the rainfall climates described above to generate species
    lists. These were (1) for WA, four IBRA7 (Interim Biogeographic Regionalisation
    for Australia, Version 7) regions from the south-west coast of Western Australia
    (Swan Coastal Plain, Avon Wheatbelt, Jarrah Forrest and Warren), (2) for SA, the
    District Council of Lower Eyre Peninsula for South Australia, (3) for NSW, the
    'Central Coast' botanical sub-division from the east coast of New South Wales
    and (4) for TAS, a customized polygon outlining the small aseasonal rainfall region
    of the north-east coast of Tasmania (Fig. 1). Species lists from each of our defined
    regions were obtained and then manually filtered to include only native shrubs.
    There were similar proportions of species present from the same families across
    all four study regions, with just six families (Fabaceae, Proteaceae, Myrtaceae,
    Ericaceae, Rutaceae and Asteraceae) making up almost 70 % of species in all regions
    ( Appendix 1).

  methods: We classified dormancy into one of five types, ND, PY, PD, MPD or MD. Dormancy
    class was mainly assigned to species from information obtained at the genus level
    from published studies, although we used species-level information when available.
    Shrub species in temperate fire-prone Australia that are serotinous (i.e. have
    a canopy seed bank) have non-dormant seeds (e.g. Lamont and Groom, 1998) while
    the majority of others have soil-stored seeds that are dormant (Auld et al., 2000;
    Ooi, 2007). The literature was searched using the Google scholar engine with the
    following parameters, genus name (for each of the genera), seed germination and
    seed dormancy. Where there were multiple published studies across multiple species
    within a genus that either confirmed dormancy type or provided evidence of dormancy
    type (e.g. a permeable seed displaying a smoke response indicative of PD), the
    genus was included. For example, the well-studied serotinous species in the family
    Proteaceae (including the genera Banksia, Dryandra, Hakea and Petrophile) have
    non-dormant seeds held in protective cones (e.g. Lamont and Groom, 1998; Bell,
    1999; Ooi, 2007) and were confidently assigned to the ND class. Similarly well
    studied are temperate-climate species with PY across multiple genera (including
    Acacia, Dillwynia, Dodonaea and Pultenaea) in the Fabaceae, Malvaceae and Sapindaceae
    (e.g. Auld and O'Connell, 1991; Turner et al 2005; Ooi et al., 2009, 2014) and
    species with PD or MPD in the families Ericaceae, Rutaceae and Lamiaceae (Ooi,
    2007; Ooi et al., 2014; Mackenzie et al., 2016) (including Boronia and Phebalium).
    For genera that were poorly represented in the literature, seed dormancy class
    was determined by a combination of author knowledge, seed morphological characteristics
    and information from germination trials conducted by Botanic Gardens' researchers
    when viability testing seed collections. It was not possible to assign dormancy
    class confidently to a species level across the full dataset, due to a lack of
    available literature on every species. As such, some genera that were subject
    to conflicting reports, where we were not confident in assigning dormancy class,
    were excluded from the analysis.
