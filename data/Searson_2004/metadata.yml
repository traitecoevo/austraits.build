  description: Study to test whether seedlings grown under water-limited conditions
    would develop denser wood than seedlings grown under well-watered conditions.
  basis_of_record: lab
  life_stage: seedling
  sampling_strategy: Plant culture ^p Seeds of the three species was obtained from
    the Australia Tree Seed Centre, CSIRO, ACT, Australia. The seed source for E.
    grandis (Seedlot 13019 28°40' S, 152°90' E) was the Coffs Harbour region of northern
    New South Wales (NSW), Australia. Eucalyptus sideroxylon (seedlot 19557; 31°20'
    S, 148° 50' E) seed was from the dryer region of mid-western NSW, Australia. Eucalyptus
    occidentalis (seedlot 13638; 33°10' S, and 119°60' E) was from the Mallee physiographic
    region of southwest, Western Australia. Seedlings were germinated in trays containing
    1:1 (v/v) soil:pearlite. After growing in the germination trays for 7 weeks, the
    seedlings were transplanted to pots (height 42.5 cm, diameter 15.5 cm, 8-l volume
    and lined with plastic bags to prevent water loss) containing soil from the Robertson
    region of NSW, Australia that was supplemented with mineral nutrients as described
    by Sefton et al. (2002). The potted seedlings were grown under well-watered conditions
    for 6 weeks before the commencement of the watering treatments, designated Week
    0. ^p Experimental and growth conditions ^p The experiment was carried out over
    13 weeks (from Week 0) in a single room of a naturally illuminated, climate-controlled
    greenhouse on the Hawkesbury campus of the University of Western Sydney. Pots
    were arranged in a randomized block design. Day/night temperature was controlled
    at 25/20 °C, and mean daytime relative humidity was 55%, ranging from 24 to 89%
    at midday during the study. Greenhouse air temperature and humidity were monitored
    with microprocessor data loggers (TGP-1500, Tiny-tag Plus, Gemini Data loggers,
    Chichester, U.K.). The experiment was a 3 x 2 factorial design with three Eucalyptus
    species and two watering treatments replicated five times. The watering treatments
    were well-watered or water-limited. In the well-watered treatment, soil was brought
    to 100% of field capacity (FC) every third day, whereas the soil in the water-limited
    treatments was allowed to dry to 50% FC before it was re-watered to 90% FC. The
    FC of the soil was determined to be 0.35 cm 3 cm -3 . Soil water content declined
    to 50% FC four times during the experiment and these drought cycles lasted for
    33, 27, 18 and 19 days, decreasing as the seedlings grew larger and consumed water
    more rapidly. The experimental design was duplicated to accommodate two harvests,
    one after 4 weeks and the other at 13 weeks. Five replicates of each species were
    germinated for a preliminary harvest at Week 0.

traits:
- var_in: predawn water potential (Mpa)
  unit_in: MPa
  trait_name: water_potential_predawn
  entity_type: population
  value_type: mean
  basis_of_value: measurement
  replicates: 5
  methods: Diurnal leaf water potential (psi-leaf ) was measured with a Scholander-type
    pressure chamber (Mk 3005, Soil Moisture Equipment, Santa Barbara, CA) during
    Week 13 when soil water content was at its lowest value in the water-limited treatment.
    Sampled leaves were the youngest fully expanded leaf attached to the main stem
    of each replicate. Measurements were made before dawn (0500-0600 h), at midday
    (1200-1300 h) and early afternoon (1500 h) on the same day. Diurnal variation
    in psi-leaf (delta psi-leaf) was calculated as the difference between predawn
    psi-leaf and the most negative of the two afternoon measurements.
- var_in: wood density (kg/m3)
  unit_in: kg/m3
  trait_name: wood_density
  entity_type: population
  value_type: mean
  basis_of_value: measurement
  replicates: 5
  methods: The periderm was removed from all stem segments before wood density measurements
    were made. Wood density was measured on the basal 6-cm stem segment. Fresh wood
    volume (Vfs ) of the 6-cm stem segment was measured using the Archimedes principal
    by immersing the segment in a beaker containing distilled water of known mass
    on a four-place balance. Each sample was lanced with a probe and placed just under
    the surface of the water. A clamp attached to a retort stand supported the probe,
    minimizing any movement of the sample. Once Vfs was measured, the sample was freeze-dried
    and dry mass (Wds ) determined. Total density was measured on a mass/volume basis,
    Dt (kg m -3).

  entity_type: population
  value_type: mean
  basis_of_value: measurement
  replicates: 5
  methods: After the basal stem segment was removed to measure wood density, a 1-cm
    sample was taken from the remaining stem to examine wood anatomy. This sample
    was immediately fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer and dehydrated
    in an ethanol series before embedding it in LR White resin. Sections of each sample
    (1 um thick) were made with a Leica microtome with glass knives and stained with
    0.5% (v/v) toluidine blue for 5 s. The sections were mounted on glass slides with
    a cover slip. Microscopic digital images were captured at 10x magnification with
    an Olympus BX60 compound microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) interfaced with a
    Jenoptik ProRes C14 digital camera (Jenoptik, Jena, Germany). Digital images were
    taken on a radial path from the pith to the bark. All image enhancement and analyses
    were performed with Image Pro Plus Version 3.0 (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring,
    MD). Binary versions of these images were created. The optimal threshold setting
    for each binary image was selected visually for each image as described by Hacke
    et al. (2001). The area of the pith was measured with an Image Pro Plus area measuring
    function. A custom written Image Pro macro, designed to detect xylem vessels,
    estimated the number and dimensions of xylem vessels in each binary image. The
    data were weighted mathematically to reflect the proportion of the stem that an
    image represented, determining the proportion of stem area taken up by vessels,
    vessel frequency and mean vessel lumen area. The conduit efficiency value (CEV)
    was calculated as the sum of all vessel radii increased to the fourth power extrapolated
    up to the whole stem area divided by the leaf area supplied by this stem. The
    CEV is an estimate of the efficiency with which a stem supplies a unit leaf area;
    a low CEV indicates that the stem has lower hydraulic conductivity. Additionally,
    Image Pro Plus was used to make a single transect of vessel diameters from the
    edge of the pith to the cambium for each stem. These measurements were made on
    color images, not the binary images.
