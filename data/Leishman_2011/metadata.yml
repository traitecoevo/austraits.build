  description: SLA data for 76 acacia species form glasshouse seedlings
  collection_type: glasshouse
  sample_age_class: seedling
  sampling_strategy: 'From Gallagher 2011: Species selection We initially compiled
    a list of 145 Australian Acacia species that have been introduced outside their
    native range. This list was generated by combining data on Australian acacias
    from four sources: (1) all species that are present in South African Herbaria
    (H. Glen, pers. comm.), (2) all species listed in the Global Compendium of Weeds
    (Randall, 2007), (3) all species introduced to two or more regions throughout
    the world as presented in Castro-Díez et al. (2011) and (4) all species listed
    as invasive in Richardson et al. (2011) (see Appendix S1 in Richardson et al.
    2011 for a database of sources). Analyses were performed on a subset of 92 Acacia
    species for which genome size data were available. Species were categorized as
    either invasive (21 species) or non-invasive (71 species), based on Richardson
    & Rejmanek (2011) (see Appendix S1 in Supporting Information). Richardson & Rejmanek
    (2011) define 23 Australia acacias as invasive, but we were unable to obtain reliable
    genome size estimates for A. holosericea A. Cunn. ex G. Don and A. saligna (Labill.)
    H.L. Wendl. and omitted these species from this study.'
