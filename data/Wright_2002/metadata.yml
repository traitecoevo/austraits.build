  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: Traits of fully expanded, outer-canopy leaves were measured on
    perennial species sampled from nutrient-rich and nutrient poor sites in each of
    two rainfall zones in eastern Australia (site details given in Table A1, species
    list in Appendix). The same set of 75 species was used here for which LL and LMA
    were reported previously (Wright et al ., 2002), with the exception that leaves
    of Eutaxia microphylla (Fabaceae) were too small for work to shear to be measured.
    For Exocarpos aphyllus (Santalaceae) and Bossiaea walkeri (Fabaceae), both leafless
    stem-photosynthesisers, 'leaf ' traits were actually measured on the youngest
    cohort of stems. For Callitris glaucophylla (Cupressaceae), traits were measured
    on terminal 'branchlets' of closely appressed leaves.

  methods: Fifteen 'sun' twigs were randomly chosen across several individuals of
    each species in mid-1998. For each twig, a leaf 'sequence' was defined from the
    youngest leaf (> 25% expanded) backwards along the twig to the oldest primary
    leaf found, whether on the same twig or, more commonly, on a branch one or more
    branching-orders back from the twig. The number of primary leaves in the sequence
    was counted. Five to six months later the number of leaves remaining in each sequence
    was counted and new sequences were marked, using the same branches as previously
    (where possible) or by tagging new branches where necessary (e.g. if the branch
    or plant had been damaged). Plants were re-censused using the same methods three
    further times, giving a sample period of 22.5-24.5 months, depending on the site.
    Over this period, leaves were censused on a total of 1893 branches, from 345 plants.
    Average leaf life span for each species was calculated as the inverse of the rate
    of leaf mortality (Southwood et al. 1986; Ackerly 1996); that is, for a population
    of leaves of size N, the average leaf life span equals N divided by the rate of
    leaf death (or births, if one assumes births and deaths are more or less in equilibrium).
    Average annual mortality was calculated by pooling mortality and population size
    for all branches for each species within each census period, calculating a time-weighted
    average of turnover from the two censuses occurring in each year of the study,
    and taking the average across the 2 years. For the two leafless, stem-photosynthesizing
    species, 'leaves' were defined as unbranched twigs, and 'branches' as twigs with
    twigs coming off them. Both 'leaf' death and 'leaves' morphing into a 'branch'
    were defined as mortality; leaf longevity was then calculated as above. LMA was
    calculated for the unbranched 'leaves' (adjusted by 1/2 as circular in cross-section).

  methods: To obtain an estimate of access to soil moisture and midday water status
    that could be compared across species within vegetation types, predawn (04:00-07:20
    hours, depending on sunrise) and midday (12:00-14:00 hours) shoot water potentials
    were measured around the dates when PV curve samples were taken. Measurements
    were made over 2 days; half of the species (randomly selected) were measured each
    day. One replicate shoot was collected from each of five individuals per species,
    if possible from individuals not growing close to each other (only four individuals
    could be found of D. triquetra). Replicates of each species were interspersed
    throughout the measurement period. Healthy terminal shoots were cut at 0.5-1.5
    m height or up to 3 m height (some individuals of Eucalyptus spp., S. acuminatum,
    B. populneus and A. doratoxylon) with secateurs, placed into a plastic bag containing
    a moist paper towel, sealed and stored in the dark. Within 10 min, shoots were
    trimmed by <1 mm with a razor blade and the balance pressure was measured in the
    pressure chamber as described above. Data exploration showed no consistent linear
    or non-linear change in 64 of the 66 species from the first to the fifth replicate.
    Thus cMD is likely to be a reasonable representative of minimum c.

  methods: In Zanne_2007; Stem hydraulic conductivity was measured on branch samples
    using previously described methods (Zwieniecki & Holbrook, 1998; Sperry & Hacke,
    2002). Branches were hydrated overnight to avoid artifacts (Wheeler et al., 2013),
    and the submerged branches were cut longer than the maximum vessel length (Cavender-Bares
    & Holbrook, 2001).  Side branches were sealed using water-insoluble acrylic-based
    glue (Loctite Super Bonder Quick Gel 409 and Accelerator 712, Henkel Australia
    Pty. Ltd., Kilsyth, VIC, Australia). Stem ends were then wrapped in parafilm and
    placed into connective tubing. Twenty mM KCl (made with deionized, degassed water)
    was forced through a 0.22 um filter and into the distal stem end at 0.1 MPa. Outflow
    from the proximal end was logged in 30 s intervals onto a balance. Stems were
    flushed until the readings to the balance stabilized and then conductance was
    measured as k = g MPa-1 s-1.  Measures were corrected by subtracting the background
    flow rate when no pressure was applied to the stem. Conductivity (Kh; g m MPa-1
    s-1) was determined by multiplying k by branch length. Sapwood specific (Ks) or
    leaf specific (KL) conductivity was calculated by dividing Kh by either total
    cross sectional area of the stem (minus bark; m2) or total leaf area subtending
    the distal branch end, (m2) respectively.

    leaf traits were measured on young to medium-aged, fully expanded, outer-canopy
    leaves. Measurements of photosynthetic capacity ( A mass and A area ), dark respiration
    rate ( R d ) and stomatal conductance to water ( G s ) were made using two portable
    photosynthesis systems equipped for automatic temperature, CO 2 and water vapour
    control (CIRAS-1, PP Systems, Hitchin, UK) and operated in the differential mode.
    We used standard cuvettes (broadleaf PLC-B and narrowleaf PLC-N). Leaves were

    (Dang et al . 1997; Mitchell, Bolstad & Vose 1999; Reich et al . 1998), and measurements
    of A and G s were made immediately. For the larger-leaved species, only the portion
    fitting in the cuvette was used for measurements; for small-leaved species gas
    exchange was measured on multiple leaves simultaneously. Photosynthesis and G
    s measurements were made at saturating or near-saturating light conditions (infrequently,
    artificial light sources were used when clouds obscured the sun), and at semi-controlled
    temperatures (mean PAR 1429 deg mol m -2 s -1 , SE 11.9, n = 487; mean temperature
    25.5 deg C, SE 0.9 deg C), with an average of 6.2 samples taken per species, all

    rate ( R d ) and stomatal conductance to water ( G s ) were made using two portable
    photosynthesis systems equipped for automatic temperature, CO 2 and water vapour
    control (CIRAS-1, PP Systems, Hitchin, UK) and operated in the differential mode.
    We used standard cuvettes (broadleaf PLC-B and narrowleaf PLC-N). Leaves were
    collected from mid- to late morning (0800- 1200 h), still attached to branches
    (Dang et al . 1997; Mitchell, Bolstad & Vose 1999; Reich et al . 1998), and measurements
    of A and G s were made immediately. For the larger-leaved species, only the portion
    fitting in the cuvette was used for measurements; for small-leaved species gas
    exchange was measured on multiple leaves simultaneously. Photosynthesis and G
    s measurements were made at saturating or near-saturating light conditions (infrequently,

    measured (mean temperature = 25.0 deg C, SE 0.04 deg C, n = 472; average sample
    size 6.5 per species). As stem material was present in the cuvette for R d measurements
    for 16 species, this was also dried and weighed, and an adjusted foliar dark-respiration
    index calculated by assuming that the rate of stem respiration per unit mass was
    on average 0.68 times that of the rate for leaf material. We used this ratio based
    on an analysis of measured rates for stems and associated leaves for 13 species
    from three different studies (Walters, Kruger & Reich 1993; Walters & Reich, 2000;
    J.L. Machado and P.B.R., unpublished results), for which the mean ratio of stem
    R d /leaf Rd was 0.68 (0.06 SE among species). An analogous index was calculated
    for Rd on an area basis. Rd measurements reported here are for these adjusted
    indices. The mean difference between adjusted and unadjusted measures was 10%.
    Overall, the two indices were strongly correlated (r = 0.992) and the choice of
    one or the other would not have changed the results in a qualitative sense.

  methods: 'Lenz 2006; PV curves were determined for each species between July and
    October 2004, with some additional sampling in November 2004 (Appendix S1). Rainfall,
    temperature, relative humidity and soil moisture during sampling periods varied
    somewhat among vegetation types (Appendix S1). Variation among species in the
    measured traits may have reflected plastic responses to differing environmental
    conditions among vegetation types as well as inherent trait differences among
    species (our primary interest). All PV curve traits reported here were inspected
    to see whether the species-mean trait varied with sampling date in each vegetation
    type. Only species-mean WTLP varied with sampling date in two of the vegetation
    types (Appendix S1). Trait measurements For the PV curves, one shoot was cut from
    each of at least three individuals of a randomly selected subgroup of species
    per vegetation type and collection. Whole leaves were used rather than shoots
    for Eucalyptus haemostoma, whereas part leaves were used for Macrozamia communis,
    a large-leaved cycad. Shoots or petioles were cut underwater, wherever possible.
    In tall plants (some individuals of Acacia doratoxylon, Brachychiton populneus,
    Eucalyptus spp. and Santalum acuminatum), branches were first cut to at least
    0.5 m and the shoots were then recut underwater. The shoots or leaves were hydrated
    in potable tap water (room temperature and kept in the dark for 24 h); then they
    were either processed or refrigerated at 7_C in the dark until processed (<48
    h). After 48 h, any remaining shoots were discarded. Shoots were left to dry on
    the bench between measurements and were weighed to 0.001 g immediately before
    and after water potential was measured with a pressure chamber (Model 1000, PMS
    Instruments, Corvallis, OR). Replicate shoots were sampled in a random interspersed
    order. We discarded shoots that did not hydrate to >_0.2 MPa, except in Dodonaea
    triquetra and Hakea teretifolia, which consistently did not hydrate to >0.3 MPa.
    The mean initial water potential of all shoots used was _0.11 MPa. Water potential
    was measured using standard procedures (Turner 1981). Three replicate PV curves
    were measured for all species, with the following exceptions: Synoum glandulosum,
    Banksia marginata, Grevillea buxifolia, Grevillea speciosa and Persoonia levis
    (four replicates); Corymbia gummifera and Gompholobium glabratum (two replicates).
    TLP was determined from the start of the straight line from plots of inverse balance
    pressure vs shoot fresh mass (Fig. 1B). Calculation of the other traits (Table
    1) followed Schulte and Hinckley (1985) and Kubiske and Abrams (1990, correction
    for overrehydration) with the exception of E. Due to the non-linear relationship
    between pressure potential at full turgor and TLP, the slope of this section of
    the curve and thus E is not constant. Customarily, E is calculated from the slope
    of the maximum hydration part of the pressure potential component of the PV curve
    (i.e. via a Hofler diagram. We used instead the average slope of the moisture
    release curve from full turgor down to TLP, defined as Emax-TLP, One reason was
    that this measure best reflects any influence of elasticity differences on TLP.
    The second reason was that existing guidelines for selecting this portion of the
    curve (Koide et al. 1989) were insufficient to provide a consistent determination
    of E at full hydration for a large number of species. Note that throughout this
    article, the term ''elasticity'' is used in its traditional sense, while E refers
    to the slope of the change in turgor pressure with changing RWC, which increases
    with decreasing elasticity.'

  methods: 'Lenz 2006; P-V curves were determined for each species between July and
    October 2004, with some additional sampling in November 2004 (Appendix S1). Rainfall,
    temperature, relative humidity and soil moisture during sampling periods varied
    somewhat among vegetation types (Appendix S1). Variation among species in the
    measured traits may have reflected plastic responses to differing environmental
    conditions among vegetation types as well as inherent trait differences among
    species (our primary interest). All P-V curve traits reported here were inspected
    to see whether the species-mean trait varied with sampling date in each vegetation
    type. Only species-mean WTLP varied with sampling date in two of the vegetation
    types (Appendix S1). Trait measurements For the P-V curves, one shoot was cut
    from each of at least three individuals of a randomly selected subgroup of species
    per vegetation type and collection. Whole leaves were used rather than shoots
    for Eucalyptus haemostoma, whereas part leaves were used for Macrozamia communis,
    a large-leaved cycad. Shoots or petioles were cut underwater, wherever possible.
    In tall plants (some individuals of Acacia doratoxylon, Brachychiton populneus,
    Eucalyptus spp. and Santalum acuminatum), branches were first cut to at least
    0.5 m and the shoots were then recut underwater. The shoots or leaves were hydrated
    in potable tap water (room temperature and kept in the dark for 24 h); then they
    were either processed or refrigerated at 7 deg C in the dark until processed (<48

  methods: Leaf work to shear (W shear ), thickness and toughness were measured for
    one leaf from each of three-five individuals per species (generally five), except
    at the high rainfall, nutrientpoor site, for which two leaves from each of 3 individuals
    per species were measured (Wright & Cannon, 2001), giving an overall average of
    5.2 samples per species. Leaf thickness was measured at two-five points per leaf
    with a dial gauge micrometer. Major veins and the midrib, where present, were
    avoided on all but the smallest leaves; otherwise placement of the micrometer
    was haphazard. The cross-section of needle leaves was assumed to be circular,
    and average leaf thickness was adjusted accordingly in these cases (multiplied
    by pi/4). Leaf work to shear (W shear ) was determined using a custombuilt machine,
    which was not intended to simulate any particular herbivore, but to provide a
    generalised measure of physical defence (Wright & Cannon, 2001). The machine measures
    the work required to cut a leaf at a constant cutting angle (20 deg) and speed,
    and is similar in principle to systems described by Darvell et al . (1996) and
    Aranwela et al . (1999). W shear and tissue toughness (= average W shear /thickness)
    measure different aspects of how robust a leaf or leaf tissue is. Both would likely
    be correlated with other physical properties such as leaf stiffness, tensile strength
    and resistance to puncture by a penetrometer (Vogel, 1988; Choong et al ., 1992;
    Wright & Illius, 1995; Edwards et al ., 2000). One cut at right angles to the
    midrib was made per leaf for measurement of W shear . Leaves were cut at the widest
    point along the lamina, or half way between the leaf base and tip if the leaf
    had no obviously widest point. For species with a prominent midrib, this feature
    could be discerned on the machine output (Wright & Cannon, 2001), and the W shear
    and toughness of the lamina were calculated separately in addition to that integrated
    over the whole leaf. This was possible for 33 species (24 at high rainfall, nine
    at low rainfall); for the remainder it was not because the midrib was not sufficiently
    prominent relative to other features in the graph, or because no midrib was present
    (e.g. needle leaves). Wholeleaf and lamina-only measures of W shear and toughness
    were tightly correlated (across all species, r 2 > 0.95, slopes not different
    from 1). Consequently we report whole-leaf measures only, because this makes no
    qualitative difference to the results, and because these measures are more analogous
    to other whole-leaf properties, such as LMA and density.
