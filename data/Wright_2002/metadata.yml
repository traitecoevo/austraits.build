  description: subset of Phd data from Ian Wright
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: Traits of fully expanded, outer-canopy leaves were measured on
    perennial species sampled from nutrient-rich and nutrient poor sites in each of
    two rainfall zones in eastern Australia (site details given in Table A1, species
    list in Appendix). The same set of 75 species was used here for which LL and LMA
    were reported previously (Wright et al ., 2002), with the exception that leaves
    of Eutaxia microphylla (Fabaceae) were too small for work to shear to be measured.
    For Exocarpos aphyllus (Santalaceae) and Bossiaea walkeri (Fabaceae), both leafless
    stem-photosynthesisers, 'leaf ' traits were actually measured on the youngest
    cohort of stems. For Callitris glaucophylla (Cupressaceae), traits were measured
    on terminal 'branchlets' of closely appressed leaves.

  methods: LMA was calculated from leaf dry mass (oven-dried for 48 h at 65°C) and
    one-sided leaf area (flat bed scanner; needle leaves assumed to have circular
    cross-section and leaf area adjusted by pi/2). For LMA, five leaves from each
    of five individuals were sampled per species for all sites except the drier, nutrient-rich
    site, for which one leaf from each of five individuals was sampled in December
    1997 and a further 6–10 leaves collected in November 1998.

  methods: Leaves were sampled for determining average total nitrogen concentration
    over a 2.5-year period at the drier, nutrient-rich site (December 1997–June 2000)
    and for c . 2 years at all other sites ( June 1998–August 2000). Between two and
    four leaf collections were made per species over that time (average 3.0). One
    collection consisted of leaves used for photosynthesis measurements (Wright et
    al ., 2001). For other collections, five leaves were collected from each of five
    individuals for each species. Only fully expanded outer canopy leaves were sampled.
    Leaves were finely ground, and leaf N concentration was measured by Kjeldahl digestion
    followed by colorimetric analysis (undertaken at CSIRO Plant Industry, Canberra).

questions:
  contributor: The referenced manuscript doesn't include details on how leaf
    phosphorus concentrations or plant height were measured. Do you have brief desciptions
    for the methods used to collect this data?
