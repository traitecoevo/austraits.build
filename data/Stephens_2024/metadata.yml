  description: Scripts were used to create tabular data output from EUCLID species profiles, at https://apps.lucidcentral.org/euclid/text/intro/index.html. Flower colour data were manually aligned to AusTraits categories. Data for 12 additional species were entered manually from original species descriptions.
  basis_of_record: literature
  sampling_strategy: Scripts were used to create tabular data output from EUCLID species profiles, at https://apps.lucidcentral.org/euclid/text/intro/index.html.
  original_file: in raw data folder
  notes: There is considerable overlap with data in CPBR_2002, the previous Euclid data extraction. Therefore, for adult leaves, any length/width values that are identical to those in CPBR_2002 have been removed.
