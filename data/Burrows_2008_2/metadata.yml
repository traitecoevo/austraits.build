  description: Study that reports on the post-fire regeneration strategies, post-fire
    juvenile period and flowering phenology of 639 species occurring predominantly
    in the southern forests and associated ecosystems of south-west Western Australia.
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: Information about post-fire regeneration strategies, flowering
    time (month) and juvenile period (months) was gathered from study sites in the
    southern forest region of the south-west of Western Australia (Fig. 1). The McCorkhill
    and Yendicup forest sites each comprised 10 small (each 4 ha) adjacent plots that
    were experimentally burnt at various times as part of a broader investigation
    into the long term effects of fire (see Burrows and Wardell-Johnson 2003). The
    Lindsay forest site (Table 1) was similar except the plots were smaller (each
    about 0.5 ha). Data from the Walpole study site (Table 1) were accumulated from
    some 400 vegetation sample sites located throughout a broad range of vegetation
    types represented in the Walpole-Nornalup National Park (see Wardell-Johnson et
    al. 1989).
