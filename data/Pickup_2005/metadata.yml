    sites
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: Four study sites were selected on the basis of contrasting rainfall
    and soil nutrient levels. The two high-rainfall sites were in Strickland State
    Forest, on the central coast of New South Wales, Australia (mean annual rainfall
    1320 mm). One was on relatively high-nutrient and the other on low-nutrient soil.
    The two low-rainfall sites were in Round Hill Nature Reserve in western NSW, Australia
    (mean annual rainfall 390 mm). Again, one site was on relatively high-nutrient
    and one on relatively low-nutrient soils (further site details in Table 1). In
    the high-rainfall zone, 20 species (four plants per species) were sampled from
    each site between July and October 2001. In the low-rainfall zone, 14 and 16 species
    (three plants per species) were sampled from the high- and low-nutrient sites,
    respectively, in November 2001. Variables were averaged across the three or four
    plants for each species. For the low-nutrient, lowrainfall site, two subsites
    several kilometres apart were sampled to ensure sufficient species could be included.
    The 70 species in this study were all dicots, spanned four orders of magnitude
    in leaf size, represented 24 families, and included life forms ranging from trees
    to subshrubs. All species included in this study were evergreen species (Wright
    et al . 2001), thus we would expect no change in leaf phenology over the 5 month
    sampling period.

  value_type: site_mean
  replicates: 4
  methods: 'The relationship between wood density and leaf size was investigated using
    four individual plants from each of the 70 species. On a randomly chosen branch
    from the upper canopy, wood samples 5 0 -70 mm in length were taken firstly where
    the aggregate stem diameter was 2-3 mm (3.1-7.1 mm -2 cross-sectional area) and
    secondly at 4-6 mm (12.6-28.3 mm 2 cross-sectional area). Fresh samples were stored
    on ice and refrigerated until processing. Bark was removed, and wood density (dry
    mass/volume) at 10 mm 2 conductive tissue estimated by interpolation between the
    wood density values calculated at the sampled cross-sections. Volume of the wood
    sample was determined by Archimedes'' principle as in Hacke et al. (2000a). Using
    a thin wire, the wood sample was submerged in a water-filled container placed
    on a balance. The balance and container were sealed to prevent airflow affecting
    the balance readings, except for a small opening through which the wood sample
    was lowered into the water. Displacement weight was converted to sample volume
    by the formula: displacement weight (g)/0.998 (g cm-3 ), where 0.998 g cm-3 is
    the density of water at 20 deg C. Wood sections were then oven-dried for 4 days
    at 60 deg C before weighing.'

  methods: For the 40 species from the two high-rainfall sites, four sun leaves were
    collected from each plant (16 leaves per species) to calculate individual leaf
    area and SLA. Fresh leaves were scanned on a flat-bed scanner and leaf area was
    measured using image analysis software (Delta-T, Cambridge, UK). Leaves were dried
    at 60 deg C for 48 h and their mass recorded. For the 30 species from the low-rainfall
    sites, SLA values were taken as a species average from a previous study that had
    sampled four leaves per plant and five plants per species (M.P., unpublished data).

  replicates: 4
  methods: While initial data were collected in terms of aggregate (or whole) stem
    cross-sectional areas, we subsequently decided to use the conductive tissue cross-section
    (excluding bark and pith) as a reference diameter. To determine the cross-sectional
    area of the aggregate (or whole) stem where the cross-section of the conductive
    tissue was 5, 10, 15, 20 and 30 mm 2 for each species, a ratio of the aggregate
    stem cross-sectional area to the conductive stem cross-sectional area was measured
    as follows for each species in the low-nutrient, high-rainfall site. For four
    individuals per species, two sections of stem 20-30 mm in length, one 3-5 mm and
    the second 6-8 mm in diameter, were randomly sampled from an actively growing
    shoot in the upper canopy. Long and short diameters were used to calculate the
    aggregate cross-sectional area. The stem was then dissected along the vascular
    cambium and the cross-sectional area of the water-conductive tissue was similarly
    calculated. Water-conductive tissue was identified as the portion of the stem
    remaining after dissection along the vascular cambium and removal of the bark
    (phloem, cortex and epidermis). Examining stained cross-sections of the stem under
    a light microscope substantiated identification of water-conductive tissue. (Hereafter,
    the term conductive tissue refers to the water-conductive tissue.) This resulted
    in two ratios of aggregate to conductive stem cross-sectional area, one at ~10
    mm 2 and the second at ~25 mm 2 . This was done to account for changes in the
    proportion of conductive and non-conductive tissue along the stem. The first ratio
    was used to calculate variables at 5, 10 and 15 mm 2 of conductive tissue, and
    the second ratio was applied at 20 and 30 mm 2 . Average aggregate cross-sectional
    area of the stem where the conductive tissue was 10 mm 2 ranged from 11.3 mm 2
    in Epacris pulchella , which had the thinnest bark, to 18.9 mm 2 in Angophora
    costata , which had the thickest.

  methods: 'from Wright 2006; Leaf area and sapwood cross-sectional area were determined
    for a 250 mm branch segment. In detail, No single best point exists to compare
    traits such as LM/ SM, LA/SM and LA/SA when considering a set of species that
    varies widely in canopy architecture and typical maximum height (here, approximately
    20 cm to 85 m). We have used several approaches (Table 1). In one study, we made
    measurements on the terminal twigs of each species, i.e. on a relatively standard
    developmental unit (Westoby and Wright 2003). For species at Ash, GLP, Myall and
    TRF, traits were measured at each of several different distances back down the
    stem from the branch tip (Falster and Westoby 2005a, 2005b and unpublished, Pickup
    et al. 2005). At GHP, RHM and RHW, traits were measured at a standard sapwood
    cross-sectional area (10 mm2; Pickup et al. 2005). For the present re-analysis,
    we took the raw data from the previous studies and, for every species possible,
    calculated patterns of leaf and stem deployment at two standard points: at 250
    mm distance from the branch tip (Ash, GLP, Myall and TRF) and at 10 mm2 stem (Ash,
    Myall, TRF) or sapwood (GHP, GLP, RHM, RHW) crosssectional area (250 mm or 10
    mm2 formulation denoted as subscript in trait abbreviations). This was done as
    follows. For each individual plant, total leaf and stem dry mass at 250 mm distance
    was estimated by straightline interpolation from values measured at the nearest
    sampling points on either side of this distance. As the dry mass data tended to
    display non-linear (power) relationships with distance from the branch tip, the
    interpolated values were calculated from log10-log10- transformed data, then back-transformed
    to the original scale. The same approach was used for interpolating data to the
    standard stem (or sapwood) cross-sectional area. For individuals where measurements
    had not been made on either side of the desired point but the nearest measurement
    had been made within 25 mm of 250 mm or 1 mm2 of 10 mm2 cross-section (i.e. within
    10% of the desired point), we extrapolated (rather than interpolated) the measured
    data to the standard point. This allowed us to include a number of individuals
    and species for which interpolation was not possible. Still, several large-leaved,
    large-stemmed species from the TRF site could not be included in the 10-mm2 crosssection
    dataset. No unusual tendencies in analyses, including the extrapolated data, were
    seen in comparison to analyses including interpolated data only (details not shown).
    To illustrate how species'' morphology varied at the two standard sampling points,
    species-mean stem cross-sectional area varied between 1.2 and 258 mm2 at 250 mm
    distance from the branch tip, while the distance from the branch tip at which
    stem cross-sectional area reached 10 mm2 varied from 64 to 995 mm.'
