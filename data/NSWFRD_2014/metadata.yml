    one observer, or a conflict between different observers (see comments column).
    When an equal number of references list the species as seeder or resprouter, this
    column reads as 'S/R' and details are given in the comments cloumn. Ideally fire
    response should be defined by mortality >70%=seeder, mortality <30%=resprouter
    [Gill & Bradstock, 1992]. Notes on conflicting or variable regeneration information.
    May indicate response to various fire intensity levels; level of mortality seen;
    a variable fire response seen by one observer within the same species. Some species
