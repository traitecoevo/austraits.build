  description: Updated eFLOWER-792 dataset, exported from PROTEUS on 15 Feb 2021.
    This is the same list of 792 angiosperm species used in the first eFLOWER paper
    (Sauquet et al., 2017) and the same list of 29 primary characters used in the
    Paleo-eFLOWER pilot paper (Schönenberger et al., 2020), but using the latest data
    in PROTEUS. Compared to the last published version of this dataset (Appendix S1
    of Schönenberger et al., 2020), this new dataset includes 608 new data records;
    in addition, 127 records have been updated and 43 deleted. Fossil data are excluded
    as AusTraits focuses on living species.
  basis_of_record: literature
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: All data were recorded at the species level, based on taxonomic
    and morphological studies.
  original_file: qry_Paleo-eFLOWER_Data_AusTraits_2021-02-15.xlsx;  the version of
    this file currently in use was submitted on 15 Feb 2021 and will be updated over
    time as species and trait values are added to the eFLOWER database (PROTEUS)
  notes: This AusTraits dataset is a live dataset that is continuing to be build upon.
    Whenever a new dataset is submitted to AusTraits, run the script in the raw data
    folder to collapse the data in the column CharacterState, Value, Min, and Mean
    into a single column. There are a large number of species excluded through "exclude_observations"
    in the metadata - these are non-Australian species whose names are not matched
    by APC/APNI. This list will need to be added to as new expanded versions of eFLOWER
    are submitted.

  unit_in: .na
  trait_name: flower_structural_sex_type
  entity_type: species
  value_type: mode
  basis_of_value: expert_score
  replicates: .na
  methods: Flowers can be either bisexual (hermaphrodite) or unisexual. In our original
    study (Sauquet et al., 2017), we used a single character to distinguish among
    the many possible ways to be unisexual, depending on whether sterile organs of
    the opposite sex (staminodes or carpellodes) are found in flowers of a given sex,
    whether male and female flowers are found on the same plant (monoecy) or separate
    plants (dioecy), as well as the various intermediate combinations that exist (e.g.,
    androdioecy, gynomonoecy). We have now simplified and divided this character into
    two and here capture only floral sex, distinguishing among three states, bisexual,
    incompletely unisexual (i.e., with pistillode in male flowers and/or staminodes
    in female flowers), and unisexual. All data from our previous dataset have now
    been rescored permanently into one of these three states. A second new character,
    Plant sexual system, resulting from the simplification outlined above, is excluded
    here because fossil flowers are usually found as individual, dispersed specimens,
    making it impossible to distinguish among different sexual systems such as monoecy
    and dioecy.
- var_in: 201. Number of perianth parts (C1)
  unit_in: count
  trait_name: flower_perianth_parts_count
  entity_type: species
  value_type: mode
  basis_of_value: expert_score
  replicates: .na
  methods: In this character, we scored the total number of perianth parts, including
    sepals, petals, or any form of tepal. A value of zero was scored when the perianth
    is absent. In flowers with perianth whorls fused along their complete length (e.g.,
    Convolvulus), counting the number of perianth organs may be difficult or challenging.
    This is traditionally done based on merism (e.g., if a calyx has 5 distinct sepals
    and the corolla is entirely fused, then the corolla is often interpreted to consist
    of five fused petals), anatomy (e.g., number of vascular traces), development
    (e.g., number of primordia), or comparison with closely related taxa. This character
    is linked with several other aspects of perianth structure, in particular phyllotaxis,
    merism, and number of whorls, each of which was also recorded as a separate character
    and analysed on its own (see below). Our main goal with this character was to
    account for the number of perianth parts in key nodes of the angiosperm tree taking
    into account these combined characters and, in whorled clades, contrast it to
    inferences based on merism and number of whorls. The total number of perianth
    parts also has the advantage of being applicable to all angiosperms, including
    those with spiral phyllotaxis.

- var_in: 204. Fusion of perianth (C1)
  unit_in: n/n
  trait_name: flower_perianth_fusion
  entity_type: species
  value_type: mode
  basis_of_value: expert_score
  replicates: .na
  methods: Fusion of perianth organs (congenital or postgenital) at anthesis, recorded
    on a continuous scale, from 0 (free parts) to 1 (parts fused along their entire
    length). Partial fusion was recorded using an approximate number between these
    two extremes (e.g., 0.1 corresponds to basal fusion, 0.5 to fusion along half
    of the length of perianth parts). In case of multiple whorls, we recorded within-whorl
    fusion in this character. For example, if organs within each whorl are fused along
    their entire length, we have recorded a value of 1 here. In cases where organs
    of two whorls are fused into a common tubular structure, such as frequently observed
    in monocots (e.g., Polygonatum), we have also recorded this as fusion in this
    character. If the two (or more) whorls differed in their extent of fusion, we
    have recorded this character as a range of values. For example, if the calyx is
    only basally fused, up to 10% of its length, but the corolla is entirely fused,
    we have recorded a range of 0.1 to 1 here. Our rationale for this was to provide
    a general character that allows comparison of fusion among all angiosperms, regardless
    of perianth architecture. Finally, we acknowledge that perianth parts may be fused
    very early in their development but then appear to be free at anthesis (i.e.,
    early sympetaly as in Apiaceae for instance (Erbar and Leins, 1996)). Given that
    developmental studies are lacking for most extant species as well as for all fossils
    in our data set, we treat such flowers as having free perianth parts in order
    to treat all species in a comparable way (i.e., at anthesis).

- var_in: 301. Number of fertile stamens (C1)
  unit_in: count
  trait_name: flower_fertile_stamens_count
  entity_type: species
  value_type: mode
  basis_of_value: expert_score
  replicates: .na
  methods: Number of fertile (functional) stamens in bisexual or male flowers. Staminodes
    (co-occurring with fertile stamens) are not counted and female flowers are ignored
    for this character. Stamen number is highly variable within angiosperms and ranges
    from one (e.g., Chloranthaceae, Endress, 1987b) to several thousands (e.g., Cactaceae,
    Barthlott and Hunt, 1993). We record the number of fertile stamens in whorled
    or spiral flowers as a continuous character (with integer values of 1 and above).
    In cases of fusion among stamen whorls, the number of stamens may be difficult
    to determine. In such cases, additional information based on merism, anatomy,
    development, or comparison with closely related taxa may be taken into account.
    In synandria of Myristicaceae, for example, the number of fertile stamens can
    be deduced from the number of thecae present (Sauquet, 2003). In cases where stamen
    or anther morphology is not fully understood, we recorded the number of fertile
    stamens only when unequivocally clarified in the literature (e.g., Malvaceae,
    von Balthazar et al., 2004). Equivocal cases were left as missing data.

  value_type: mode
  basis_of_value: expert_score
  replicates: .na
  methods: Here we here record absence or presence of the filament, and in the latter
    case, the shape of the filament. Shape is considered in terms of length and width
    and is defined in relation to anther length/width. The width of the filament may
    thus either be broad as in laminar (e.g., Eupomatiaceae) or bulky stamens (e.g.,
    Chloranthaceae), or narrow (filamentous) as found in many core eudicots groups
    (e.g., Rosaceae). This character was considered inapplicable when filaments were
    entirely fused with each other or to the perianth.

  entity_type: species
  value_type: mode
  basis_of_value: expert_score
  replicates: .na
  methods: Fusion of stamen (and staminode) filaments among each other at anthesis
    (congenitally or postgenitally) is recorded on a continuous scale, from 0 (free
    filaments) to 1 (filaments fused along their entire length). Partial fusion is
    recorded using an approximate number between these two extremes (e.g., 0.1 corresponds
    to basal fusion, 0.5 to fusion along half of the length of filaments). In cases
    of distal (postgenital) fusion of filaments (e.g., Impatiens, von Balthazar and
    Schönenberger, 2013), the length of the fused section is measured against total
    filament length. In cases where the filaments are proximally fused with the corolla
    (i.e., flowers with a stamen-corolla tube as present in most asterids), only the
    distal part of the filaments that are free from the corolla are considered. In
    cases of multiple stamens whorls, we record within-whorl fusion in this character.
    For example, if organs within each whorl are fused along their entire length,
    we record a value of 1 here. In cases where organs of two or more whorls are fused
    into a common tubular structure, (e.g., Malvaceae, Lecythidaceae), we also record
    this as fusion in this character. If two (or more) whorls differ in their extent
    of filament fusion (e.g., Napoleonaea), we record this character as a range of
    values. For example, if an outermost stamen whorl is only basally fused, up to
    10% of its length, but an inner whorl is entirely fused, we record a range of
    0.1 to 1 here. Our rationale for this is to provide a general character that allows
    comparison of fusion among all angiosperms. This character is not applicable when
    there is a single structural stamen (i.e., one stamen, no staminodes; e.g., Chloranthus,
    Chloranthaceae).

  trait_name: flower_anther_orientation
  entity_type: species
  value_type: mode
  basis_of_value: expert_score
  replicates: .na
  methods: Anthers of angiosperms are rather uniform in their basic structure. They
    normally have four microsporangia (pollen sacs) that are arranged pair-wise in
    two thecae. The two microsporangia of a theca usually release their pollen grains
    through a common opening (stomium). At anthesis, the stomium of these thecae may
    face the floral centre (i.e., anther orientation is introrse) or the floral periphery
    (i.e., anther orientation is extrorse). A third possibility is latrorse anther
    orientation, where pollen is released toward the side (i.e., toward neighbouring  nthers).
    Often, it is difficult to establish anther orientation clearly in a flower as
    this is a gradual feature with many intermediate stages. In addition, a given
    flower may also be polymorphic for this feature. Lastly, thecae may be positioned
    in a transverse position at the tip of the connective and thus dehisce upward
    in the flower (e.g., Sinofranchetia, Endress and Hufford, 1989). We use "apical"
    to describe this latter character state.

  methods: Gynoecium phyllotaxis may be spiral or whorled (Endress, 2014). In rare
    cases, carpels may also be arranged in an irregular fashion, but such cases are
    not represented in our data set. Gynoecia with two or more whorls of carpels are
    rare in angiosperms (Staedler and Endress, 2009). Therefore, contrary to what
    was done in scoring the perianth and the androecium, we do not have a separate
    character for the number of gynoecium whorls. Instead, we distinguish between
    single whorls and multiple whorls in this character. This character is not applicable
    to unicarpellate flowers.

  methods: Number of fertile or sterile carpels in bisexual or female flowers, recorded
    as a continuous character (with integer values of 1 and above). Contrary to the
    number of stamens (character 301), the number of co-occurring carpellodes (sterile
    carpels) is counted here because this number is often more easily obtained from
    the literature than the actual number of fertile carpels. However, consistently
    with our treatment of sexual dimorphism, the number of carpellodes in male flowers
    is ignored for this character. In multicarpellate, unilocular gynoecia with complete
    carpel fusion up to the stigma (e.g., Primula), it may be difficult to assess
    the number of carpels unequivocally. In such cases, we have scored the number
    of carpels only if it is well established based on anatomical or developmental
    investigations. Similarly, in gynoecia where one or more carpels are reduced (e.g.,
    in the pseudomonomerous gynoecia of some Arecaceae, Stauffer et al., 2002), the
    total number of structural carpels was only scored when unequivocally determined
    in the literature. Contrary to the perianth and the androecium, we do not have
    a separate character for gynoecium merism here. This is because gynoecia with
    two or more whorls are rare in angiosperms and gynoecium merism therefore usually
    equals the number of carpels per flower.

    a sessile stigma (e.g., some Clusiaceae). When present, we also record the shape
    of the style in terms of length and width in relation to ovary length and width.
    We do not distinguish between fused or free styles (see character 406).

  value_type: mode

  methods: There are many ways in which flowers can be zygomorphic (monosymmetric,
    with a single plane of bilateral symmetry). Here we record perianth symmetry,
    regardless of androecium or gynoecium symmetry; thus the character is not applicable
    when the perianth is absent. We distinguish strict actinomorphy (i.e., polysymmetry,
    with three or more planes of bilateral symmetry) from spiral actinomorphy. In
    addition, disymmetry (two orthogonal planes of bilateral symmetry; e.g., Papaveraceae)
    and asymmetry are treated here as separate character states. As for the fusion
    of the perianth, this character is applied to the perianth as a whole. In case
    of flowers with two or more perianth whorls, species were scored as actinomorphic
    if all whorls are actinomorphic and as zygomorphic if one or more whorls are zygomorphic.

  entity_type: species

  methods: The ovary is the part of the gynoecium where the ovules are produced. The
    ovary may be located on the receptacle and thus be positioned above the insertion
    level of the remaining floral organs (i.e., the ovary is superior and the flower
    is hypogynous). Alternatively, the ovary may be embedded in the receptacle and
    therefore be located below the insertion level of the remaining floral organs
    (i.e., the ovary is inferior and the flower is epigynous). Flowers with a hypanthium
    may either have a superior ovary (perigyny; e.g., many Rosaceae) or an inferior
    ovary (epiperigyny) (Simpson, 2010). It is also possible that the ovary is inferior
    to a certain degree only, such as half-inferior, if the receptacle is surrounding
    the ovary to its mid-level. Here we recorded the ovary position either as superior,
    inferior, or one of the following intermediate states, 1/4 inferior or less, half-inferior,
    3/4 inferior or more.
- var_in: 308. Fusion of filaments to inner perianth series (C1)

  trait_name: flower_filament_fusion_to_inner_perianth
  entity_type: species
  value_type: mode
  basis_of_value: expert_score

  methods: Here we record the fusion of filaments with the innermost perianth organs
    at anthesis on a continuous scale, from 0 (filaments completely free from perianth)
    to 1 (filaments fused along their entire length with the perianth; the "entire
    length" of the filament is defined as the distance between the floral base and
    the joint between filament and anther). Partial fusion is recorded using an approximate
    number between these two extremes (e.g., 0.1 corresponds to basal fusion, 0.5
    to fusion along half of the length of perianth parts). If two (or more) stamen
    whorls (including staminodial whorls) differ in their extent of filament fusion
    with the perianth, we record this character as a range of values. For example,
    if the filaments of an outermost stamen whorl are fused, up to 90% of their length,
    but an inner whorl only up to 50%, we record a range of 0.5 to 0.9 here. Our rationale
    for this is to provide a general character that allows comparison of fusion among
    all angiosperms.

  basis_of_value: expert_score
  replicates: .na
  methods: Anther attachment refers to the area of insertion of the filament on the
    anther connective (i.e. the tissue connecting the two thecae of an anther). Anthers
    may be basifixed, with the filament attached to the base of the connective; dorsifixed,
    with the filament attached to the dorsal side of the anther, or ventrifixed, with
    the filament attached to the ventral side of the anther. With our definition of
    the filament as encompassing the region below the pollen sacs (see Character 305),
    we score laminar stamens as basifixed. Anther versatility is not scored here as
    it is not directly linked to any of the three types of anther attachment, for
    example the basifixed stamens of Tulipa or the dorsifixed stamens of Lilium may
    be versatile.

  trait_name: flower_gynoecium_placentation
  entity_type: species
  value_type: mode
  basis_of_value: expert_score
  replicates: .na
  methods: Here we record the different types of placentation in apocarpous/unicarpellate
    and in syncarpous gynoecia. In apocarpous and unicarpellate gynoecia, placentation
    is often described as marginal as the ovules are usually attached along the ventral
    slit (i.e., the zone where the carpel margins become postgenitally closed during
    carpel development). In syncarpous gynoecia there are three main types of placentation
    (e.g., Endress, 1994), 1) axile placentation refers to ovaries where the ovules
    are placed in the angle between carpel flanks in the center of the ovary; 2) in
    ovaries with parietal placentation the ovules attach to the ovary wall where two
    carpels meet; 3) in ovaries with free-central placentation the ovules are attached
    to a central column that emerges from the base of the ovary and protrudes into
    the non-septate ovary. It is not unusual that syncarpous gynoecia show a transition
    from proximally axile to a distally parietal placentation (e.g., Polemoniaceae,
    Schönenberger, 2009). Basal and apical placentation may occur both in apocarpous/unicarpellate
    and in syncarpous gynoecia. Usually there is one longitudinal series of ovules
    attached to each carpel margin. However, both in apocarpous/unicarpellate and
    in syncarpous gynoecia there may be more than one series of ovules at the flanks
    of a carpel. These latter cases are referred to as laminar (or laminar-diffuse)
    placentation (e.g., in some Nymphaeaceae). A placenta that is protruding from
    its surroundings and has more than two series of ovules (either axile or parietal)
    is called protruding-diffuse.
- var_in: 313. Anther dehiscence (D1)
  unit_in: .na
  trait_name: flower_anther_dehiscence
  entity_type: species
  value_type: mode
  basis_of_value: expert_score
  replicates: .na
  methods: Anther dehiscence refers to the type of opening of the anther when releasing
    its pollen through the stomia. The most common mode of dehiscence is by longitudinal
    slits that extend along the entire length of each theca. The stomium may bifurcate
    at its distal and/or proximal end and thus a valve is formed (e.g., Eupomatia,
    Endress and Hufford, 1989; Endress, 1994). Such dehiscence is commonly referred
    to as H-valvate. Specialized valves in the form of flaps for each pollen sac occur
    in some Laurales and basal eudicots (Endress and Hufford, 1989). We refer to them
    here as flap-valvate. Dehiscence of longitudinal slits may be incomplete and only
    occur over a short extent in the distal, proximal or central part of these slits
    and may thus be pore-like (e.g., Bixa, Venkatesh, 1956). In several taxa, however,
    specialized pores are observed (e.g., Erica, Hermann and Palser, 2000). In addition,
    there are several rarer modes of dehiscence such as circular dehiscence of one
    anther (e.g., Hennecartia) or several anthers (Stephania, Meng et al., 2012).
    Longitudinal slits may also be confluent distally (e.g., Cocculus, Endress and
    Hufford, 1989; Triuridaceae, Rudall, 2003).
- var_in: 314. Connective extension (apical) (D1)
  unit_in: .na
  trait_name: flower_anther_connective_extension
  entity_type: species
  value_type: mode
  basis_of_value: expert_score
  replicates: .na
  methods: We define apical (distal) connective extensions (also called "distal connective
    protrusions", e.g., Hufford and Endress, 1989) as sterile anther structures that
    distally extend beyond the level of the thecae (i.e., the two lateral pairs of
    pollen sacs of a tetrasporangiate anther). Here we record absence or presence
    of anther connective extensions and we also record the shape of these extensions
    in terms of length in relation to the length of the thecae. We refer to connective
    extensions as short if they are shorter than a third of the length of the thecae.
    Such short extensions are found in many angiosperm lineages (e.g., Daphniphyllum,
    Hufford and Endress, 1989; Thunbergia, Schönenberger, 1999). Connective extensions
    that are longer than a third of, but not longer than the thecal length are here
    referred to as long (e.g., Loropetalum, Hufford and Endress, 1989), while we reserve
    the state 'very long extension' for those that are longer than the thecae (e.g.,
    Asarum, Endress and Hufford, 1989; Chloranthus, Endress, 1987b).

  entity_type: species
  value_type: mode
  basis_of_value: expert_score
  replicates: .na
  methods: Pollen grains are often described according to the shape, structure, and
    position of their apertures. Here we score the main shape of the many described
    aperture types. Aperture terminology is partly determined by the position of the
    aperture on the pollen grain (either at the pole or at the equator) and pollen
    grain polarity, in turn, is determined by the spatial orientation of the microspore
    in the meiotic tetrad. Porate apertures are round and pore-like and may be situated
    globally or equatorially (a pore-like aperture is referred to as ulcus if positioned
    at the pole). Colpate apertures are elongate and grooved (referred to as sulcate
    if positioned at the pole). Colporate apertures combine the groove of colpate
    and the pore of porate apertures. In addition, there are some rare shapes including,
    for instance, spiraperturate apertures (a pollen grain with one or more spiral
    apertures). Number (see character 5000. Number of apertures) and shape of apertures
    are usually expressed in combined terminology (e.g., monocolpate, tricolporate;
    see Halbritter et al., 2018 for detailed explanation and examples).
- var_in: 230. Perianth phyllotaxy (D1)
  unit_in: .na
  trait_name: flower_perianth_phyllotaxis
  entity_type: species
  value_type: mode
  basis_of_value: expert_score
  replicates: .na
  methods: Perianth parts may be organized in one or more whorls or along a continuous
    spiral, usually with wide divergence angles more or less equal to 137.5 degrees
    (Endress, 1987a, 2011; Endress and Doyle, 2007; Kuhlemeier, 2007). Less frequently,
    perianth phyllotaxis may be irregular (Zhao et al., 2012). Perianth phyllotaxis
    at anthesis may differ from phyllotaxis of perianth part primordia at their inception
    and it is not uncommon that spirally initiated perianths become whorled later
    through development (Erbar and Leins, 1994; Schönenberger and Grenhagen, 2005;
    Endress, 2010, 2011; Zhang and Schönenberger, 2014; Loefstrand et al., 2016).
    Here we score perianth phyllotaxis only at anthesis because developmental data
    are lacking for most species in our data set (for a detailed discussion of this
    important point, see Sauquet et al., 2018; Sokoloff et al., 2018). ^p Perianth
    phyllotaxis at anthesis is not always easy to recognize. The first criterion,
    when perianth parts are in sufficient number, is the pattern of parastichies and
    presence or absence of orthostichies (Endress and Doyle, 2007; Endress, 2010).
    However, this criterion cannot be used when perianth parts are few (e.g., five)
    and the insertion of parts along a circle at anthesis does not inform us on whether
    phyllotaxis is whorled or spiral or irregular. A more universal criterion lies
    in the divergence angles between successively initiated parts, which usually approximates
    137.5 degrees (golden angle) in Fibonacci spiral flowers (Staedler and Endress,
    2009). However, it may be difficult or impossible to recognize successively initiated
    perianth parts in an anthetic flower. If we define a series as a set of more or
    less similar parts occupying the space of and arranged more or less in a circle,
    we may then use the number of distinct distances between two adjacent parts in
    a series as a criterion to identify phyllotaxis. Whorled series only have one
    identical distance between parts, whereas spiral series are typically expected
    to show two distinct distances, a short distance and a longer distance (Hirmer,
    1931). In addition, most spiral series are characterized by a Fibonacci number
    of parts (e.g., 3, 5, 8) although individual variations are common so that this
    number is rarely completely fixed in spiral flowers. Thus, series with a consistent
    number of parts of 4 or 6 are less likely to be spiral. Furthermore, developmental
    data, when available, may still inform us on phyllotaxis at anthesis because spiral
    phyllotaxis never appears to result from simultaneous, whorled initiation (but
    note that the contrary is not true). Last, a potentially very confusing situation
    may arise when a perianth has two or more distinct, well differentiated series
    of identical number of parts. In such cases, whorled perianths are generally expected
    to show perfect alternation of successive whorls in addition to equal angles and
    distances within each whorl, whereas spiral perianths are expected to display
    less exact and less regular alternation of successive series and are expected
    to show the above pattern of two distances within each series caused by the golden
    angle. Such is the case of Ranunculus acris (Ranunculaceae), a species commonly
    assumed to have a whorled perianth, but which in fact has a spiral perianth (Schoeffel,
    1932). Although these rules can help us clarify difficult situations, one should
    note that they are not universal, zygomorphy and double positions may superpose
    on all types of phyllotaxis and create more complex patterns. In particular, unequal
    distances and divergence angles are expected at anthesis in whorled flowers that
    are also zygomorphic or characterized by double positions. ^p Scoring perianth
    phyllotaxis is further complicated by the fact that many eudicots appear to have
    a more or less spiral calyx and a whorled corolla (Ronse De Craene, 2010). However,
    this has not been thoroughly documented yet across the clade and most descriptions
    and illustrations of these taxa do not allow us to distinguish easily between
    a spiral and a whorled calyx, even with the rules outlined above. Therefore, in
    this study, we have scored perianth phyllotaxis of most eudicots based on phyllotaxis
    of the inner perianth series (i.e., the corolla).
- var_in: 234. Perianth differentiation (D1)
  unit_in: .na
  trait_name: flower_perianth_differentiation
  entity_type: species
  value_type: mode
  basis_of_value: expert_score
  replicates: .na
  methods: There are many ways in which perianth organs may look different from each
    other in a given flower. Typically, outer perianth parts are sepaloid and protect
    the other floral organs during floral development, while inner organs are often
    petaloid and play a role in pollinator attraction (Endress, 1994). However, it
    is also possible that all parts are either sepaloid or petaloid but remain differentiated
    in shape, size, and/or texture. In case of spiral perianths, differentiation may
    be continuous (i.e., gradual), whereby two successively initiated organs are very
    similar or only slightly different, while the outermost and innermost organs at
    both ends of the spiral are very different from each other (e.g., Chimonanthus).
    Here, we broadly define differentiation as any form of such differences, but record
    these various situations as separate character states. In contrast, we score all
    undifferentiated perianths (i.e., with all organs alike) in the same character
    state, regardless of phyllotaxis and number of whorls. In the special case of
    perianths consisting of a single whorl, we have decided to score them as undifferentiated
    rather than treat them as inapplicable because we aimed at a broadly comparable
    character describing the expression of general differentiation among perianth
    organs, rather than only the differentiation among multiple whorls. Thus, our
    perianth differentiation character may be seen as both functional (the parting
    vs. sharing of functions among perianth parts) and developmental (the expression
    of a genetic program for different forms of perianth parts vs. a single program
    for a single type of perianth part morphology). Within-whorl differentiation,
    whereby organs of the same whorl take different forms, is common in zygomorphic
    flowers (e.g., Balsaminaceae, Fabaceae, Orchidaceae) but is not taken into account
    here. This character is not applicable when the perianth is absent.
- var_in: 330. Androecium structural phyllotaxy (D1)
  unit_in: .na
  trait_name: flower_androecium_structural_phyllotaxis
  entity_type: species
  value_type: mode
  basis_of_value: expert_score
  replicates: .na
  methods: Androecium phyllotaxis may be spiral, whorled or irregular (Endress, 1987a).
    We call this character structural because both fertile stamens and staminodes
    were considered here. Furthermore, in cases of stamen fascicles, it is the phyllotaxis
    of fascicles, not individual stamens that we record here. Stamen arrangement is
    most often either spiral or whorled and in the latter case stamens may be arranged
    in one or more whorls. Irregular stamen arrangements occur less commonly and are
    often associated with polystemony (e.g., Medusagyne, Matthews et al., 2012). Androecium
    phyllotaxis is not always easy to determine, especially when there are many stamens
    (for guidelines, see notes under character 230. Perianth  phyllotaxis). Particular
    caution should be exerted when scoring this character based on taxonomic literature,
    where irregular phyllotaxis is commonly mistaken for spiral phyllotaxis (e.g.,
    Annonaceae, Xu and Ronse De Craene, 2010; Endress and Armstrong, 2011). This character
    is not applicable when there is a single structural stamen (i.e., one stamen,
    no staminodes; e.g., Chloranthus, Chloranthaceae).

    minor, Siphonodon celastrineus, Trachycarpus fortunei
  reason: These are 'unplaced' species that likely show up in the APNI list because
    they are horticultural species, but they are not widespread naturalised species
- variable: taxon_name
  find: Elatine triandra, Galbulimima belgraveana, Hydrocotyle vulgaris, Pennantia
    corymbosa, Strychnos nux-vomica, Galbulimima baccata
  reason: These are 'misapplied' species that are unlikely to actually be Australian
