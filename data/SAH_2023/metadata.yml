  description: Plant fire response and other related trait data extracted from the 
    eFlora of SA, the electronic Flora of South Australia.
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: This dataset is sourced from the Electronic Flora of South Australia
    online website (version date 2022-05-06). Briefly, the textual descriptions of 
    each taxon were downloaded and organised into a tabular format of individual taxon 
    names and their corresponding text using R coding script. Sentences mentioning 
    the words 'burn' or 'fire' were extracted and manually scored to match relevant 
    traits in AusTraits. Unclassified taxa were inferred, where possible, as possessing 
    a trait value from a higher-level taxonomic description, e.g. all taxa in X genus 
    were classified as resprouts, which was mentioned only in the genus description. 
    All below-species-level taxa were also inferred from species-level values where 
    possible.

    website (version date 2022-05-06). Trait values were manually extracted as described 
    under the dataset's sampling strategy.

  methods: This dataset is sourced from the Electronic Flora of South Australia online 
    website (version date 2022-05-06). Trait values were manually extracted as described 
    under the dataset's sampling strategy. Taxa described as common after fire or 
    found after fire were generally scored as having post-fire recruitment.
