  description: A curated collection of plant growth form values that includes nearly
    all species in the Australian Plant Census (APC). Dataset is compiled from a combination
    of data extracted from state and national online floras, supplemented by the taxonomic
    literature.
  basis_of_record: preserved_specimen
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: "A curated collection of plant growth form values that includes
    all species in the Australian Plant Census (APC). The basis for this dataset are
    the data from the online Flora of Australia, state herbarium floras (VicFlora,
    PlantNet (NSW), South Australia eFlora, Florabase (WA), and NT eFlora), and the
    Lucid Key compilation for Australian Tropical Rainforest Plants. These were supplemented
    by the dataset on Tasmanian plants compiled by Greg Jordan and Matt McGlone. After
    each dataset was scraped and compiled into a spreadsheet, it was run through a
    script that extracted words pertaining to plant growth forms; these automatically
    extracted datasets are independently in AusTraits. With a few exceptions, the
    plant growth forms values from the floras were only accepted if the same or very
    similar terms were reported in all the floras. Others were left to assess in steps
    below. In addition, at this stage, climbing plants were not yet scored unless
    an entire family is woody or herbaceous.\tTasmanian species are considered `scraped`,
    but for species not in Greg Jordan and Matt McGlone's compilation, the taxa were
    individually looked up at utas.edu.au/dicotkey, a reference to Tasmanian plants
    maintained by Greg Jordan. There were only ~100 species and the descriptions were
    written in a way that would have been more difficult to scrape. In sum, the scraped
    data yielded results for 24521 APC accepted taxa (species, infraspecifc taxa,
    genera, families). ^p 2.\tFilling in missing taxa for families and genera with
    a single plant_growth_form: The next step was to fill in data for families (or
    genera) with a single reported plant growth form. For instance, all orchids are
    herbs and therefore herbaceous. Filling in family-level values added data for
    2979 APC accepted taxa and filling in genus-level values added data for an additional
    1053 APC accepted taxa. ^p This left 4217 taxa to fill in and a diverse set of
    approaches were used to fill in this data, generally working through taxa one
    at a time, family by family. Some strategies were faster, others slower. The faster
    approaches were: In the floras, for herbaceous species, the descriptions often
    omit any mention of the species being 'herbaceous' or an 'herb', instead indicating
    only if it is annual or perennial. Therefore, for the remaining missing species,
    the next step was to check if one (or more) of the scraped floras reported that
    a species was an annual/perennial. All mentions of annual were considered to be
    'herbaceous/herb' without further checking, unless, a different plant growth form
    or woodiness score already existed in AusTraits (very few cases). If a taxon was
    'perennial' the actual species description in the relevant flora was read, to
    ensure it wasn't a woody perennial. In all cases, they turned out to be an 'herb'.
    Usually it was fully herbaceous, although occasionally it was a taxon with a woody
    base or was a 'soft shrub'/'green shrub'. An additional 276 APC-accepted taxa
    were scored using this approach. The flora descriptions for subspecies and varieties
    generally do not mention plant growth form or woodiness if that is a trait that
    doesn't vary between subspecies/varieties. Therefore, for these taxa, the individual
    descriptions were checked and if there was no mention of plant growth form, the
    species plant growth form was used for the subspecies/varieties. An additional
    734 taxa were scored using this approach. ^p There were taxa included in one of
    the scraped floras which had a description that was not easily scraped. This occurred
    when none of our search terms were present in the description, if it was a climbing
    plant (woodiness status often unclear), or was a plant that bridged being an herb
    and a shrub. For these species I read the actual description in the flora to fine
    tune the scraped terms. For instance, distinguishing between woody versus herbaceous
    climbing species and determining if an `herb shrub` was a small plant with a woody
    base or a large annual/biennial plant. 638 APC accepted taxa were scored using
    this approach. For taxa with phrase names, it was assumed that unless a state
    flora (or other scraped data source) included a plant growth form description
    (mainly from Florabase and Lucid; Australia Tropical Rainforest Plants), a plant
    growth form description wasn't going to be found. Therefore, if a plant growth
    form was given in AusTraits, it was used; otherwise it was left as 'unscorable'.
    (The lack of other information was verified by checking many taxa while developing
    this approach.) Most AusTraits values for phrase names came from either Cooper
    & Cooper 2013 or from one of the big state compilations and are considered to
    be accurate. 410 phrase name taxa were tagged us unscorable. For taxa that are
    hybrids, the value of the two parent-taxa was used if they were the same. In the
    few cases where the two parent-taxa weren't identical (usually `shrub tree` versus
    `tree`, the combination of values was used (i.e. `shrub tree` for the above example).
    An additional 79 APC accepted species were scored using this approach. The remaining
    2011 taxa were looked up from a large collection of different resources, with
    a selection of different approaches used. These are mostly taxa from Queensland
    (no online flora), the Northern Territory (incomplete online flora), offshore
    islands or taxa that have been described in the past 10 years and have not yet
    been incorporated into the various state floras. For taxa with descriptions in
    the published Flora of Australia volumes, the text was copied from the pdf copies
    of the Flora. Both the volumes with taxa from Australia's islands were published,
    so filling in data for these species was fast. A few additional families had published
    volumes, but generally if the print Flora of Australia volume was published, the
    taxon descriptions had already been uploaded to the electronic Flora of Australia
    version. 71 species were scored from the Flora of Australia print editions. The
    taxonomic literature was heavily relied upon to fill in missing information. The
    taxon name was looked up in the APC/APNI name-checker (biodiversity.org.au/nsl/services/search/names)
    and the most recent taxon description or taxonomic revision was downloaded. 1231
    APC taxa were scored from taxonomic revisions. 15 species had their plant growth
    forms inferred from online keys, usually those in KeyBase. Very few keys in KeyBase
    included `plant growth form` or `woodiness` as a distinguishing trait, which was
    disappointing. ^p In addition, the following websites were found to be well-referenced
    and heavily relied upon: Queensland species profiles site (apps.des.qld.gov.au)
    - this has complete taxon descriptions, although this resource is very sparsely
    populated; Wikipedia: since the Wikipedia descriptions are linked to iNaturalist,
    they are becoming increasingly well-referenced and detailed; A collection of websites
    documenting information about threatened and endangered species, including environment.gov.au/biodiversity/threatened/species,
    environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/sprat/public/publicspecies; For naturalised species,
    a collection of websites documenting information about invasive species, including
    cabi.org, Lucid - weeds, weeds.dpi.PlantNet.gov.au, weeds.brisbane.qld.gov.au,
    daf.qld.gov.au,  hear.org; A collection of websites with worldwide species compilations,
    although usually with relatively sparse information content, including eol.org,
    plants.jstor.org, powo.science.kew.org; Compilations of plant and plant features
    for various audiences including Plants For a Future (pfaf.org), Useful Tropical
    Plants (tropical.theferns.info), Useful Temperate Plants (temperate.theferns.info);
    eFloras: for naturalised species, information was used from a number of different
    national floras, but in particular there were many species in the Flora of China.
    For naturalised species, national or regional floras including pza.sanbi.org,
    indiabiodiversity.org, nparks.gov.sg, nzflora.info (includes some native species),
    pngplants.org. ^p These methods allowed all but 176 APC accepted taxa to be scored.
    69 of these taxa had pre-existing values in AusTraits and in these instances,
    the AusTraits value was used. 53 taxa were scored from poorly documented websites
    or photos. Values obtained from these websites are documented as ` website - without
    source references or incompletely referenced` and these taxa will be revisited
    when additional sources become available. No information could be found for 54
    taxa. 2 of these have recent taxonomic publications that are behind paywalls.
    The others had at most a nebulous photograph or image of an herbarium specimen
    from which plant growth form could not be discerned."

  methods: See 'sampling strategy' above for method details. Overall, while many plants
    were very clearly described as herbs, shrubs, or trees, some taxa's plant growth
    forms and woodiness were less obvious. As indicated above, the scraped data was
    only used without double-checking the actual taxon description all scraped floras
    had identical or very similar plant growth form scores. This of course means that
    there is greater certainty for the values of species that occur in several states.
    Taxa were also double-checked if the score in the flora was different to that
    already in AusTraits. Trait values were scored to align with the plant growth
    forms values worked out during one of the AusTraits vocabulary workshops. A few
    Australia-centric terms are retained, including hummock grasses (`hummock`), tussock
    grasses (`tussock`), and `mallee`. Unless a more specific value was scrapped/coded
    from some source, all members of the families Poaceae, Cyperaceae, Juncaceae,
    Restionaceae, Centrolepidaceae, Anarthriaceae, and Ecdeiocoleaceae were scored
    as `graminoid`. All large monocots/ferns with a trunk and elevated leaf canopy
    are considered `palmoid`, including grass-trees, trunked cycads, palms, and tree
    ferns. Large monocots without a trunk are usually scored as `basal_large`.
