  description: A study on an alpine plant, Wahlenbergia ceracea, to determine the
    shapes of plastic responses in 14 traits across germination, leaf, physiology
    and reproductive fitness trait types across a broad thermal gradient of temperatures
    to generate a more complete understanding of the capacity for plants to respond
    and of the role that phenotypic plasticity plays in facilitating species' responses
    to warming temperatures.

  sampling_strategy: 2.1 Study species and seed source ^p Wahlenbergia ceracea Lothian
    (Campanulaceae) waxy bluebell (Figure 1a) is a facultatively autogamous perennial
    herb that is sparsely distributed across south-eastern Australia. Seeds were originally
    collected from Kosciuszko National Park, NSW, Australia under Scientific Licence
    issued by the New South Wales Parks and Wildlife Service (permit SL101031). Seeds
    were obtained from alpine elevations (~1,590-2,100 m), where mean maximum monthly
    air temperatures during the growing months are typically just ~10-20°C (Australian
    Government Bureau of Meteorology, 2010-2022). Seeds were germinated and then grown
    up to form an F0 generation, and then crossed under controlled conditions to produce
    F1 and F2 generations (further details in Notarnicola et al., 2021). For the current
    experiment, we used F2 individuals that include mostly half-sibling families (mean
    relatedness = 0.226 ± 0.08 SD). See Supporting Information Appendix S1 for additional
    details of all methods sections.The thermal gradient plate experiments described
    here were run as two components; first, a germination experiment in which we assessed
    germination properties of seeds across a thermal gradient; and second, a growth
    experiment, in which we took seedlings and grew them across a thermal gradient
    and subsequently assessed their physiology and reproductive traits. Both experiments
    used 12 x 12 gridded thermal gradient plates (Figure 1b; dimensions, 1,030 mm
    H x 1,020 mm W x 1,020 mm L with a 760 mm x 760 mm plate surface; GRD1, Grant
    Instruments, UK). Sample sizes varied between the different traits measured (details
    below), and names of traits used in analyses are given in italics. ^p 2.2 Germination
    experiment and germination traits measurement ^p Germination traits were assessed
    using 49 F2 families distributed across thermal gradient plates (TGPs). Two TGPs
    were used to generate a thermal gradient between 6 and 35°C (with some temperature
    variation between blocks, see Supporting Information); photoperiod was 16 hr day/8
    hr night with 24 hr constant temperature settings. For each family, we took approximately
    240 seeds and distributed them across 12 50 mm Petri dishes (i.e. approximately
    20 seeds per dish, where one dish represents one replicate for that family) containing
    1% agar medium. One Petri dish per family was allocated to each of the 12 temperature
    columns across the TGP in a randomised Latin square design (12 temperature x 12
    families = 144 dishes). The germination experiment was conducted over five experimental
    blocks using these two identical TGPs. Each of the five experimental blocks used
    12 F2 families, but 11 families were repeated due to fungal infections in some
    dishes affecting germination. There was a total of 49 families and 588 germination
    dishes in the final dataset. ^p We measured two traits relating to seed germination
    (hereafter, collectively referred to as germination traits) across the thermal
    gradient. Germination was scored twice weekly for the first 2 weeks and then weekly
    until no new germination was recorded for 2 weeks. We conducted modified cut-tests
    to assess seed viability (Hoyle et al., 2015) and, for each dish, assessed the
    mean germination time (in days) and germination count (the total number of seeds
    that germinated in each dish) at the conclusion of the experiment. ^p 3 Growth
    experiment, Cultivation and growth of seedlings ^p For the growth experiment,
    we used seed of each of 24 families, which were germinated in a glasshouse under
    a common temperature regime of 25/15°C day/night. The resulting seedlings were
    grown in two batches (blocks) of 12 families each and were moved into a modified
    TGP once plants were established in tins (Figure 1b). This TGP was set to a temperature
    range of 7-35°C with 16 hr photoperiod. Temperatures measured at rosette height
    were ~11-28°C. Plants were watered as appropriate to maintain near-saturated soil
    conditions in the different temperature treatments. One plant per family was allocated
    to each of the 12 temperature columns across the TGP in a randomised Latin square
    design (12 temperatures x 12 families = 144 plants) and the experiment was replicated
    across two blocks for a total of 24 families and 288 plants.

    on healthy, fully expanded leaves from reproductive side stems that were excised
    for chlorophyll fluorescence measurements (see section e below). These leaves
    were then dried and weighed, and leaf mass per area (LMA) was calculated as the
    leaf dry mass divided by the area (mg/cm2).

  methods: We measured six traits that related to the physiological function of the
    photosystems and physiological thermal tolerance (hereafter, collectively referred
    to as physiology traits) across the thermal gradient. Physiology traits were measured
    after 50-65 days in the TGP using three healthy leaves per plant, from reproductive
    side stems where possible. We used a thermoelectric plate and a pulse amplitude
    modulated (PAM) chlorophyll fluorescence imaging system as per Arnold et al. (2021)
    to measure the following traits; psi-PSII, the operating efficiency of photosystem
    II (PSII) in the light, FV/FM, the maximum quantum efficiency of PSII photochemistry
    in the dark, Tcrit-hot, critical thermal maximum as the limit to heat tolerance,
    Tmax-hot, point of irreversible membrane disruption as maximum heat threshold,
    Tcrit-cold, critical thermal minimum as the limit to cold tolerance, and NT, as
    the ice nucleation temperature. ^p Briefly, one leaf per plant was light-adapted
    at 280 umol m-2 s-1 at 25°C, and then, psi-PSII was measured. One leaf per plant
    was used for heat tolerance assays, which consisted of placing 30 leaves on a
    thermoelectric Peltier plate below the Imaging-PAM. These leaves were dark-adapted,
    and FV/FM was measured at 20°C prior to increasing the temperature up to 65°C
    at a heating rate of 30°C/hr. The temperature-dependent change in minimal chlorophyll
    fluorescence (T-F0) was measured while heating the Peltier plate, which was then
    used to extract Tcrit-hot and Tmax-hot values (described below). One leaf per
    plant was used for cold tolerance assays, which were identical to heat tolerance
    assays except the Peltier plate was cooled from 20 to -20°C at a rate of 15°C/hr,
    and Tcrit-cold and NT values were extracted from these T-F0 curves. ^p The T-F0
    curve of both heat and cold tolerance assays is characterised by a stable or slow
    rise in F0 values until a critical temperature threshold where F0 rises rapidly.
    The inflection point of extrapolated regression lines for each of the slow and
    fast rise phases of the T-F0 curve is the critical temperature, Tcrit (Knight
    & Ackerly, 2002). The inflection point was calculated as per Arnold et al. (2021)
    and Tcrit was distinguished between heat and cold tolerance as Tcrit-hot and Tcrit-cold
    respectively. For heat tolerance, the temperature at 100% of relative F0, which
    is the point of irreversible membrane disruption, called Tmax-hot (Knight & Ackerly,
    2002). The temperature at which there was heat released during the freezing process
    (exothermic reaction) was recorded for each sample in the cold assays as the ice
    nucleation temperature (NT).

  methods: We measured two traits that related to the flowering and reproductive fitness
    of the plants (hereafter, collectively referred to as fitness traits) across the
    thermal gradient. The date of the first open flower on each plant was recorded
    via monitoring two to three times per week throughout the growth experiment and
    was converted to flowering onset (as number of days since transplantation). After
    approximately 70 days in the TGP and after measuring the leaf and physiological
    traits, plants had outgrown the TGP and were moved to larger growth cabinets.
    Plants from successive groups of three columns were placed in a single growth
    cabinet matched to the light intensity (130-170 umol m-2 s-1) and photoperiod
    of the TGP and maintained at approximate mean temperatures of the three columns
    (10, 16, 22, and 28°C respectively). Plants were maintained at these temperatures
    for 40 days and then, temperatures and photoperiods progressively reduced over
    5 weeks until all cabinets were set to 9°C with 11 h photoperiod, to mimic cooling
    temperatures and reduced photoperiod of autumn. Prior to harvest after 40 days
    of simulated senescence, the total number of reproductive stems at harvest was
    counted as a close proxy for reproductive fitness.
