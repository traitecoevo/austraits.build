  description: A glasshouse experiment investigated the response to phosphorus of
    2 common and abundant ephemeral forbs and several additional species.
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: 'The experimental layout was a randomised block design with 3
    replicates of each of 2 (0 P/200 P) treatments. Each block was located about 10
    m from neighbouring blocks and the 0 P and 200 P plots within each block were
    separated by a 1 m buffer and were evenly matched in the total and individual
    species abundance of ephemeral forbs. Individual plot size was 4 by 4 m and 20
    g/m2 (200 kg/ha) of phosphorus (as single superphosphate, 9.1% total P, 80% water
    soluble) was applied to the 200 P plots in mid August 1996. In winter, the vegetation
    was dominated by Amaranthaceae [Ptilotus exaltatus (Purple mulla mulla), Ptilotus
    macrocephalus (Pussytail mulla mulla), Ptilotus aerovoides (Mat mulla mulla)];
    Chenopodiaceae [Dysphania kalpari (Green crumbweed)] and Malvaceae [Abutilon otocarpum
    (Desert chinese lantern)], while in summer the Poaceae were dominant including
    Dactyloctenium radulans (Button grass), Urochloa gilesii (Hairy-edged armgrass),
    Enneapogon polyphyllus (Limestone grass). Biennial and perennial species present
    throughout 1996-97 and belonging to the Chenopodiaceae were Salsola kali (Buck
    bush) and Maireana tomentosa (Felty bluebush). Soil samples (1 bulked sample of
    3 cores per plot) were taken from a depth of 0-10 cm in August before application
    of fertiliser. Analysis by standard methods indicated a pH of 6.5 +- 0.14 (1 :
    5, soil:water), an organic matter content of 0.56 +- 0.04% (Walkley-Black acidic
    dichromate oxidation), a concentration of total N of 0.72 +- 0.25 mg/g (Kjeldahl
    digestion including a selenium catalyst), of available P of 41.6 +- 0.45 ug/g
    (Bray and Kurtz No. 2 available P) and an electrical conductivity of 43 +- 0.35
    mS/cm (as for pH).'

    description: The soil type at the study sites is a silty clay loam of high P-fixation
      capacity and is rich in iron and aluminium oxides and poor in available N and
      P (Bennett and Adams 1999). Long-term annual rainfall at Hamersley Station is
      354 mm, divided between 2 rainy seasons, December-March and May-August. Roughly
      two-thirds of the annual total falls in the summer period and one-third during
      winter. Because of this rainfall distribution, both summer and winter ephemeral
      forbs grow in the Pilbara. During June 1996-June 1997, the total rainfall was
      596 mm, with 73% falling during the warmer months of December-March (Fig. 1).
      The mean monthly maximum temperature was about 36 deg C in January, and in July,
      the mean monthly minimum temperature fell to 6 deg C

  methods: Above-ground biomass (1 m2 quadrat) was harvested 4 times (August 1996,
    November 1996, March 1997, and June 1997) from each of the 6 plots. Areas disturbed
    by previous sampling activity were avoided during quadrat placement. Vegetation
    within each quadrat was clipped to 2 cm above ground level, separated into individual
    species, and divided into 2 subsamples. One subsample was oven-dried at 60 deg
    C for 48 h, and weighed and the other freeze dried and weighed. With the exception
    of the perennial grasses, collected plant material was green and not senescent.
    The oven-dried subsamples of all species were used for most chemical analysis.
    Plant material was digested in H2SO4 and H2O2 at 320 deg C and the digest made
    up to 75 mL. An aliquot of the digest was used for the analysis of N and P (Murphy
    and Riley 1962; Keeney and Nelson 1982), and the same digest was used for potassium
    (K), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), and sodium (Na) determination using atomic
    absorption spectroscopy.
