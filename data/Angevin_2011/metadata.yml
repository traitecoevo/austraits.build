  description: Species richness and functional trait diversity response to land use
    in a temperate eucalypt woodland community; sampled in Red Gum forests in western
    Victoria
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: Most of the data was collected in Woohlpooer SF, but some data
    were collected in Red Gum forests in two nearby western Victoria locations, Glen
    Isla S.F and Cherrypool S.F

    database.xls" extracted. Original copy of the excel file located in Google Drive
