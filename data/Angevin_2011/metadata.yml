    in a temperate eucalypt woodland community; sampled in Red Gum forests in western
    Victoria
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: Most of the data was collected in Woohlpooer SF, but some data
    were collected in Red Gum forests in two nearby western Victoria locations, Glen
    Isla S.F and Cherrypool S.F

    database.xls" extracted. Original copy of the excel file located in Google Drive
