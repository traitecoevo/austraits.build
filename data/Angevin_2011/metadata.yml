  description: Species richness and functional trait diversity response to land use
    in a temperate eucalypt woodland community; sampled in Red Gum forests in western
    Victoria
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: Most of the data was collected in Woohlpooer SF, but some data
    were collected in Red Gum forests in two nearby western Victoria locations, Glen
    Isla S.F and Cherrypool S.F
