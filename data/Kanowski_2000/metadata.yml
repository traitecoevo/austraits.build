  description: The study examines the correlations between the distribution and abundance
    of the folivores and ecological factors at a number of sites. This includes a
    survey of the foliar chemistry of rainforest trees in the study area conducted
    at sites stratified by altitude and geology.
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: Site location and sampling strategy   ^p   Location of sites    ^p   Foliar
    samples were collected from 16 sites stratified by elevation and geology in rainforests
    of the Atherton Uplands. Upland sites ranged from 700 - 760 m and highland sites
    from 960 - 1180 m a.s.l. Within each elevational stratum, four sites were located
    on nutrient-rich basaltic soils and four sites on relatively nutrient-poor soils
    developed on acid igneous or metamorphic rocks. Rainfall ranged from 1800 - 3200
    mm per annum at the sites, with no significant difference between altitudinal
    or geological strata.    ^p   Location of transects within sites    ^p   Samples
    were collected from a 100 m transect established beside a road at each site. The
    locations of the transects within each site were chosen subjectively to avoid
    areas showing signs of major disturbance. Transects were established on ridges
    or upper slopes in order to preserve the dichotomy between nutrient-rich and nutrient-poor
    soils.    ^p   Sampling strategy    ^p   This study required a biologically meaningful
    measure of leaf chemistry that could be standardised between sites. The following
    sampling strategy was adopted to satisfy these criteria, i) Foliage samples were
    collected only from trees. While vines and shrubs are eaten by the folivores,
    trees are reported to comprise the majority of the diet of the folivores in the
    study area (Procter-Gray 1985; Goudberg 1990).;  ii) Samples were collected of
    mature foliage only. While most folivores appear to prefer young foliage to mature
    foliage, mature foliage is thought to set the carrying capacity of a site. This
    is because mature foliage provides a subsistence resource for folivores during
    those periods when few young leaves are available (Waterman and McKey 1989; Oates
    et al. 1990). ;  iii) For the purposes of collection and analysis, trees were
    stratified into two broad functional guilds, viz climax and pioneer species (Swaine
    and Whitmore 1988). Without this stratification, the results of the survey may
    have been strongly influenced by the particular disturbance history experienced
    at each site.    ^p   Leaf collection and storage    ^p   Sampling was conducted
    between August and October 1997. This is the dry season in the study area, when
    few trees in higher elevation forests are flushing young leaves (Procter-Gray
    1985; Goudberg 1990). Leaves were collected during the day over one or two days
    at each site. Sampling was rotated amongst the four environmental strata to control
    for any temporal variation amongst the samples   ^p   Foliage was collected from
    20 randomly-chosen climax trees per site with the constraint that individual trees
    were sampled without replacement. The foliage of each sample was analysed separately.
    There was no requirement that samples should represent different species, as the
    aim was to sample species in approximate proportion to their abundance at a site.
    The measures of nutritional quality of the samples collected at each site were
    pooled to provide an 'average' measure of foliage quality at that site.  ^p   Additionally,
    foliage was collected from the most common pioneer tree species at each site.
    Foliage was sampled from two individuals of each pioneer species with leaves of
    those two individuals pooled for analysis. Between two and seven pioneer species
    were sampled per site. Trees were identified in the field or from samples returned
    to the laboratory by A. K. Irvine, CSIRO Atherton.   ^p   For both climax and
    pioneer species, foliage was collected from one to three branches in the sun-exposed
    crown of each selected tree. Only mature, fully-expanded leaves without a covering
    of epiphyllae were collected. About 25 g of leaves was collected from each tree.   ^p   Immediately
    after collection, a subsample of three to five leaves was wrapped in aluminium
    foil and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Upon return to the laboratory, these leaves
    were transferred to a freezer and kept at -20 degC until analysis. The remainder
    of the sample was placed in sealed plastic bags with some damp blotting paper
    and kept cool in an ice-chest. Upon return to the laboratory, petioles were clipped
    from these leaves.

  notes: For a few of the micronutrients, Co, Cr, Ni, and Se, for many observations
    the "lower detection limit" was reported. These have been filtered out using custom
    R code, as John Kanowski suspects the values are lower than the reported value.

  replicates: 1
  methods: Cellulose content was determined gravimetrically using a modification of
    Updegraff (1969). Accurately weighed samples (approximately 0.1 g) of dried leaf
    were ground in several drops of a reagent made up from acetic acid, distilled
    water and nitric acid in the ratio of 8to2to1 by volume. Each ground sample was
    washed into a test tube with the reagent, the volume of reagent made up to 10
    ml and the tube placed in a boiling water bath for 30 minutes. The tubes were
    centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 30 minutes, the supernatant discarded and the pellets
    resuspended in 5 ml reagant. Each sample was centrifuged three times in total.
    The remaining pellets were dried in the tubes at 60degC for 48 hours. The tubes
    containing the dried pellets were weighed and then washed, dried overnight at
    60degC and reweighed. Samples were analysed in duplicate. For logistical reasons,
    only the eight highland sites were analysed for cellulose.

    The extract was prepared from 0.5 g of flash-frozen leaf which was finely ground
    in 2 ml chloroform and then mixed with 2 ml of ammoniacal chloroform. The extract
    was centrifuged at 10000 rpm for 5 minutes, the supernatant collected and mixed
    with 1 ml of 1M HCl. The mixture was allowed to separate into phases after which
    nine drops of the aqueous layer was placed in black ceramic wells. Six drops of
    Mayer's reagent was added to each well and the presence of an off-white precipitate
    scored from 0 to 4. To standardise the rating all samples which gave a positive
    result were tested a second time.    ^p   The reagents commonly used to screen
    for the presence of alkaloids detect most alkaloidal compounds, but they also
    react with a number of other basic chemicals (Webb 1949; Robinson 1979). The interpretation
    of positive results is therefore somewhat subjective. In this study, I assumed
    that all positive results indicated the presence of alkaloids but some scores
    may be false positives.

  methods: Phenolic compounds were extracted following the procedures outlined in
    Cork and Krockenberger (1991) to prevent degradation of phenolics by high temperatures
    and light. Sample of 0.1 g of flash-frozen leaf were placed in test tubes and
    homogenised in 5 ml of 50% aqueous acetone using a cell homogeniser. The tubes
    were covered with foil to exclude light and shaken for 30 minutes at 4 degC. After
    each extraction, the tubes were centifuged at 5000 rpm for 5 minutes at 4 degC,
    the supernatant collected and stored in the dark at 4 degC and the pellet resuspended
    in 3 ml of solvent. This extraction procedure was repeated three times in total.
    The supernatants for each sample were combined and stored in the dark at -70 degC
    until analysis.   ^p   The concentration of total phenolics in samples was determined
    by the Folin-Ciocalteu method (Waterman and Mole 1994). Commercial tannic acid
    (Sigma, St Louis, USA) was used as a standard. The concentration of proanthocyanidin
    condensed tannins in samples was determined by the HCl-butanol method (Mole and
    Waterman 1987). Quebracho tannin was obtained and purified for use as a standard
    for the condensed tannin assay (Hagerman and Butler 1989; A. Hagerman pers. comm.),
    but the extract produced a markedly non-linear standard curve. For this reason,
    concentrations of condensed tannins were expressed in terms of an internal standard,
    defined as the absorbance of each sample at 550 nm divided by the sample weight
    (see Waterman and Mole 1994).

  methods: Leaf toughness was used as an index of fibre in this study. Choong et al.
    (1992) and Choong (1996) showed that there was a good correlation between leaf
    toughness and leaf fibre content, both at the scale of the various tissues that
    comprise a leaf and in comparisons between different tropical trees species. Leaf
    toughness was measured as the force required to punch a flat-ended rod through
    the leaf blade using a home-made 'penetrometer' modelled after the device described
    in Feeny (1970). The force was supplied by adding water at a constant rate to
    a container resting on a steel rod 5 mm in diameter. Following Choong et al. (1992),
    this value was divided by the thickness of the leaf blade to remove confounding
    effects of leaf thickness on toughness. Leaf thickness was measured with a screw
    micrometer to the nearest 0.001 of an inch (0.0254 mm). Both toughness and thickness
    were measured once per leaf on the middle part of the leaf blade, avoiding major
    veins. Toughness was measured on a subsample of five freshly collected mature
    leaves from each sample, the number of replicate measures determined from a pilot
    study. To merge these values into AusTraits, the values, given as kg of force
    were converted to standard AusTraits units, N/m, as follows, kg*(9.8N/kg)*(1000
    mm/m)/(5 mm * 3.14), following methods given in Onoda 2011.
