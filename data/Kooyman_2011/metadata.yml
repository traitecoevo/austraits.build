  description: Rainforest species traits
  collection_type: literature
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: Floristic data and sampling  Presence-absence data were available
    for 286 community samples from Cape York and the Wet Tropics in Queensland (Qld)
    (Tracey, 1982; Williams & Tracey, 1984; Stanton & Fell, 2005), and for 310 community
    samples from three areas in northern New South Wales (NSW), Nightcap-Border Ranges,
    Dorrigo and Washpool (R.K., personal data, and the YETI vegetation survey data
    base) (Table 1). The two latitudinal regions (tropics and subtropics) are separated
    by more than 1100 km (Fig. 1). All species in all samples (full pool 1744 taxa,
    trees and shrubs only, with 1137 included in the study) were taxonomically checked
    (Hyland et al., 2003) and updated, and reconciled where necessary with collection
    records using the Australian Virtual Herbarium (AVH) database (http://www.rbg.vic.gov.au/avh).
    Incorrect, redundant and duplicate names were removed, and data were entered into
    matrices (presence/absence by sample by area and region) and merged at various
    scales. Across the sample, alpha diversity ranged from 7-117 species and was similar
    in each area and region (Table 1). The assemblage samples referred to here represent
    samples of all trees, shrubs and saplings >1 m in height in a constrained area
    (e.g. the area defined by c. 30 nearestneighbour canopy to subcanopy trees, that
    can vary from c. 0.1 to 0.5 ha under different circumstances related to stem size;
    Appendix S1 in the Supporting Information provides details, including additional
    background information on vegetation history).Vamosi et al. (2009) found that
    plot area was not a significant predictor of community phylogenetic structure
    in the studies they compared, but emphasized the desirability of using samples
    that were small enough to allow individuals to interact. Palms, ferns, vines and
    other (non-woody) life-forms were excluded from the data used in the analyses
    presented here (refer to Kembel & Hubbell, 2006). Focal communities and species
    pools Climate varies from highly seasonal tropical lowlands to everwet tropical
    mountains at low latitudes, to seasonal moist subtropical at higher latitudes.
    Across this large geographic region the sampled rain forest habitats include coastal
    sand dunes, estuaries and headlands, near-coast coral atolls and islands, alluvial
    floodplains and riparian edges, foothills, uplands and highland mountains. In
    the tropical region, Wet Tropics has high mountains and dramatic relief (0-1650
    m) with large river valleys and deeply dissected terrain, while Cape York has
    more constrained relief (0-500 m). In the subtropics all areas have significant
    mountain ranges (up to and >1100 m) and relatively heterogeneous topographic gradients.
    Offshore islands associated with the Wet Tropics sample, and the extensive low
    coastal plains of Cape York, are absent in the subtropics. Rainforest vegetation
    across the sample varies from drier deciduous and semi-deciduous vine thickets
    in parts of Cape York (Kikkawa et al., 1981) to the warm lowland and cool wet
    tropical forests of the Wet Tropics, and the warm lowland and cool wet subtropical
    to warm-temperate forests of northern NSW (refer to Webb et al., 1984; Nix, 1991).
    Species pools (for free-standing woody taxa only) were defined at three scales
    (Table 1), (1) full pool (all rain forest taxa north of Townsville to Torres Strait
    in Qld, plus all of NSW); (2) regional pool (the full pool split by region; Qld
    and NSW); and (3) local sample pool, based on those species that occur in each
    of the five areas; Cape York (CY) andWet Tropics (WT) in Qld, and Nightcap-Border
    Ranges (NB), Dorrigo (DO) and Washpool (WA) in NSW.

- var_in: wood density species
  unit_in: kg/m3
  trait_name: wood_density
  value_type: expert_mean
  replicates: .na
  methods: Wood density (WD) estimates for adults were extracted from published sources,
    and where necessary converted from dry weight (kg m-3) to basic density (Chave
    et al., 2009). In general Van Gelder et al., (2006) found that adult and juvenile
    wood density were well correlated across species, r = 0.91, P<0.001, giving confidence
    that trends are consistent across the range of variation in the size classes sampled.
    Where species-level data were missing for wood density we used genera and occasionally
    family level values (for some Qld species), so results for this trait should be
    viewed in that light.

- var_in: Height (m)
  unit_in: m
  trait_name: plant_height
  value_type: expert_max
  replicates: .na
  methods: Estimated maximum height at maturity (Hmax) was based on field information
    previously collected by RK for NSW that reflects maximum canopy height (m) for
    species (at largest known diameters, at reproductive maturity). For Qld the data
    for maximum height were extracted from the sources cited above for the other traits,
    and supplemented by RK where known. This provided a single value for maximum potential
    height for each species.
- var_in: leaf length minimum (mm)
  unit_in: mm
  trait_name: leaf_length
  value_type: expert_min
  replicates: .na
  methods: Species-level data for leaf size, wood traits (including density) and seed
    and fruit size were taken from published floras and other sources for all species
    in the sample (Cooper & Cooper, 2004; Hyland et al., 2003; Cornelissen et al.,
    2003). Minimum and maximum leaf sizes reported in the floras generally reflected
    the range of variation in leaf size on mature plants, and juvenile leaf sizes
    were excluded from consideration. Leaf size (as surface area) reported here is
    for whole simple leaves (and phyllodes) and for lateral leaflets of compound leaves.
    Leaf size (LA) was estimated using maximum leaf length and width, where Area =
    length*Width*0.70 (cm2) which has been shown to correlate well with photographic
    area estimates of rainforest tree leaves (e.g. Kraft et al., 2008).
