  description: A collection of trait data on species growing in Adelaide and Melbourne
    to determine the traits of species that are advantaged and disadvantaged by urbanisation.
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: trait data on species growing in Adelaide and Melbourne are extracted
    from the literature; in particular, data sourced from floras, Ecology of Sydney
    plant series in Cunninghamia and global databases for exotics.
  original_file: Adelaide data from RD.xls and Melb and Adeliade traits metadata.doc
    provided by author and archived in raw data folder and GoogleDrive folder
  notes: SLA, seed mass, and plant height values that are duplicates and are from
    datasets known to have been sources for this compilation (mainly botanical collections,
    but also some datasets from John Morgan's lab, Trevor Meers data, and a few datasets
    from Macquarie University labs, Leishman_1992 and Hughes_1992 in particular) have
    been filtered out
