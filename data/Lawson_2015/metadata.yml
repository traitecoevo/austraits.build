  description: Hydrological conditions explain variation in wood density in riparian plants of south-eastern Australia
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: 'Fifteen riparian sites were selected along gauged rivers within the south-east coast and south-eastern Murray Darling drainage basins of Australia (Fig. 1 in Lawson et al. 2015). To differentiate rivers according to ecologically relevant components of hydrology, Olden & Poff (2003) described a statistical method for determining a minimally redundant set of hydrological descriptors. Kennard et al. (2010) followed this method to define a set of 120 hydrological metrics relevant to Australian rivers, which included metrics of central tendency and dispersion in all five dimensions of hydrological variation (magnitude, frequency, duration, timing and rate of change). These metrics were then used to classify Australian river systems into twelve distinct flow regime classes, providing a foundation for analysing the properties of ecosystems across hydrological gradients. In this study, sites were drawn from rivers corresponding to "stable winter baseflow", "unpredictable baseflow" and "unpredictable intermittent" hydrological classes, as described by Kennard et al. (2010). These are the best represented hydrological classes in eastern New South Wales and Victoria and, combined, span clear gradients of flooding intensity and hydrological unpredictability. Five sites per hydrological class were selected based on the following criteria: gauged locations were selected that had >15 years of associated continuous hydrological data, and an absence of flow regulation, significant water extraction or catchment urbanization, following Kennard et al. (2010). To minimize signals associated with human land-use and river type, the following further criteria were used to shortlist possible study sites: all were partly confined valleys with discontinuous floodplain pocket River Styles, c.f. Brierley & Fryirs (2005), had an intact native riparian vegetation cover (a band of native riparian vegetation extending >15 m from the bankfull channel edge), were in good geomorphic condition (lack of significant human-induced erosional or depositional landforms), had minimal vegetation clearing (catchment predominantly covered by native vegetation) and occurred in a catchment smaller than 1000 km2. These criteria were assessed using a combination of visual inspection of satellite photography (Google Earth, Microsoft Bing) and information from the NSW Riparian Vegetation Extent data set and the NSW Office of Water River Styles_ geospatial data set (Healy et al. 2012). To select the 15 study sites from this shortlist, accessibility by road, permission from state or private landholders and proximity of accessible areas to continuous hydrological monitoring stations were taken into account. At each site, a 10-m-by-50-m plot was marked out, with the longest edge abutting the channel edge. Criteria for selection of plot locations were as follows: geomorphic homogeneity (the plot comprising only sloping bank where possible) and lack of anthropogenic disturbance such as built structures, roads or tracks, recent logging or clearing (in the last 20–30 years), herbicide spraying or animal grazing. Variation in the maximum height above the channel edge between plots was kept to within approximately 1.5 m.'

  methods: Wood samples were collected from woody species present within the plot at >1% cover in shrub, subcanopy or canopy strata, which had trunks robust enough to core. A 100-mm wood sample from each of two individuals per species was extracted using a 5.15-mm-diameter, triple-threaded increment borer (Hagla of Sweden). Samples were extracted from the base of the main trunk, 10 cm above the leaf litter level, and air-dried at 20–45C. On return to the laboratory, samples were rehydrated to saturation in deionized water and 10-mm sections of mature heartwood were cut flush with a razor, using visual inspection of vessel occlusion as an indicator of maturity. Sections were measured (x, y and z dimensions) to the nearest 0.01 mm with callipers (Mitutoyo America Corporation, Aurora, IL, USA) to calculate wet volume, then oven-dried at 80C for 48h and weighed using a microbalance (Mettler Toledo, Greifensee, Switzerland). Wood density was then calculated as the ratio of oven dry mass to wet volume (g cm_3). Species that were present in plots but which could not be cored due to small size were assigned averaged values of wood density from the same species measured at other sites, where possible. Remaining species were assigned values from peer-reviewed literature sources. Appendix S1 contains further details about the data set, including data density information.
