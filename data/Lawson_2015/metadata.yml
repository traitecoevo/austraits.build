  description: Hydrological conditions explain variation in wood density in riparian
    plants of south-eastern Australia
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: 'Fifteen riparian sites were selected along gauged rivers within
    the south-east coast and south-eastern Murray Darling drainage basins of Australia
    (Fig. 1 in Lawson et al. 2015). To differentiate rivers according to ecologically
    relevant components of hydrology, Olden & Poff (2003) described a statistical
    method for determining a minimally redundant set of hydrological descriptors.
    Kennard et al. (2010) followed this method to define a set of 120 hydrological
    metrics relevant to Australian rivers, which included metrics of central tendency
    and dispersion in all five dimensions of hydrological variation (magnitude, frequency,
    duration, timing and rate of change). These metrics were then used to classify
    Australian river systems into twelve distinct flow regime classes, providing a
    foundation for analysing the properties of ecosystems across hydrological gradients.
    In this study, sites were drawn from rivers corresponding to "stable winter baseflow",
    "unpredictable baseflow" and "unpredictable intermittent" hydrological classes,
    as described by Kennard et al. (2010). These are the best represented hydrological
    classes in eastern New South Wales and Victoria and, combined, span clear gradients
    of flooding intensity and hydrological unpredictability. Five sites per hydrological
    class were selected based on the following criteria: gauged locations were selected
    that had >15 years of associated continuous hydrological data, and an absence
    of flow regulation, significant water extraction or catchment urbanization, following
    Kennard et al. (2010). To minimize signals associated with human land-use and
    river type, the following further criteria were used to shortlist possible study
    sites: all were partly confined valleys with discontinuous floodplain pocket River
    Styles, c.f. Brierley & Fryirs (2005), had an intact native riparian vegetation
    cover (a band of native riparian vegetation extending >15 m from the bankfull
    channel edge), were in good geomorphic condition (lack of significant human-induced
    erosional or depositional landforms), had minimal vegetation clearing (catchment
    predominantly covered by native vegetation) and occurred in a catchment smaller
    than 1000 km2. These criteria were assessed using a combination of visual inspection
    of satellite photography (Google Earth, Microsoft Bing) and information from the
    NSW Riparian Vegetation Extent data set and the NSW Office of Water River Styles_
    geospatial data set (Healy et al. 2012). To select the 15 study sites from this
    shortlist, accessibility by road, permission from state or private landholders
    and proximity of accessible areas to continuous hydrological monitoring stations
    were taken into account. At each site, a 10-m-by-50-m plot was marked out, with
    the longest edge abutting the channel edge. Criteria for selection of plot locations
    were as follows: geomorphic homogeneity (the plot comprising only sloping bank
    where possible) and lack of anthropogenic disturbance such as built structures,
    roads or tracks, recent logging or clearing (in the last 20-30 years), herbicide
    spraying or animal grazing. Variation in the maximum height above the channel
    edge between plots was kept to within approximately 1.5 m.'

  methods: Wood samples were collected from woody species present within the plot
    at >1% cover in shrub, subcanopy or canopy strata, which had trunks robust enough
    to core. A 100-mm wood sample from each of two individuals per species was extracted
    using a 5.15-mm-diameter, triple-threaded increment borer (Hagla of Sweden). Samples
    were extracted from the base of the main trunk, 10 cm above the leaf litter level,
    and air-dried at 20-45 deg C. On return to the laboratory, samples were rehydrated
    to saturation in deionized water and 10-mm sections of mature heartwood were cut
    flush with a razor, using visual inspection of vessel occlusion as an indicator
    of maturity. Sections were measured (x, y and z dimensions) to the nearest 0.01
    mm with callipers (Mitutoyo America Corporation, Aurora, IL, USA) to calculate
    wet volume, then oven-dried at 80C for 48h and weighed using a microbalance (Mettler
    Toledo, Greifensee, Switzerland). Wood density was then calculated as the ratio
    of oven dry mass to wet volume (g cm_3). Species that were present in plots but
    which could not be cored due to small size were assigned averaged values of wood
    density from the same species measured at other sites, where possible. Remaining
    species were assigned values from peer-reviewed literature sources. Appendix S1
    contains further details about the data set, including data density information.
