  description: SLA measurements for acacia
  collection_type: glasshouse
  sample_age_class: adult, seedling
  sampling_strategy: 'Species selection We initially compiled a list of 145 Australian
    Acacia species that have been introduced outside their native range. This list
    was generated by combining data on Australian acacias from four sources: (1) all
    species that are present in South African Herbaria (H. Glen, pers. comm.), (2)
    all species listed in the Global Compendium of Weeds (Randall, 2007), (3) all
    species introduced to two or more regions throughout the world as presented in
    Castro-Diez et al. (2011) and (4) all species listed as invasive in Richardson
    et al. (2011) (see Appendix S1 in Richardson et al. 2011 for a database of sources).
    Analyses were performed on a subset of 92 Acacia species for which genome size
    data were available. Species were categorized as either invasive (21 species)
    or non-invasive (71 species), based on Richardson & Rejmanek (2011) (see Appendix
    S1 in Supporting Information). Richardson & Rejmanek (2011) define 23 Australia
    acacias as invasive, but we were unable to obtain reliable genome size estimates
    for A. holosericea A. Cunn. ex G. Don and A. saligna (Labill.) H.L. Wendl. and
    omitted these species from this study.'

  methods: Mature, fully expanded leaves were collected in the field, scanned and
    oven-dried to calculate leaf area per unit dry mass. In most cases, 5 replicates
    were measured for each species.
