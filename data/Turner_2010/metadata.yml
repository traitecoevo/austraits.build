  description: To try and clarify whether leaf delta13C is inherently stable across
    environments or varies with environment, particularly rainfall, we measured the
    leaf delta13C of a number of Eucalyptus species in two common gardens varying
    in rainfall.
  collection_type: common garden and field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: At two common gardens, 10–25 leaves, depending on size, were collected from four replicate
    trees of each species. Leaves were around 1 year old when collected.
  original_file: Turner-Coolgardie_Kalgoorlie_xlsx.xls
  notes: Field collection occurred on the 19th of August 2005.

  Coolgardie arboretum:
    Soil type: clay
    m.a.s.l: 417
    MAP: 216
    latitude (deg): -30.95
    longitude (deg): 121.15
    description: The trees at Coolgardie were planted between 1974 and 1980 in a 5-m
      grid pattern. In August 2005, the trees at Coolgardie were 3–10 m in height
      (Table 1). Species were spaced such that the crowns of the
      individual trees did not touch.

    description: At Coolgardie, one species, Eucalyptus leptopoda, was collected from
      a bush site 1 km from the arboretum.

  methods: The delta13C was referenced against Vienna Peedee Belemnite on a scale
    normalized by assigning consensus values of -46.6‰ to L-SVEC lithium carbonate
    and +1.95‰ to NBS 19 calcium carbonate (Coplen et al. 2006). Using this referencing
    system, the delta13C of NBS 22 oil is -30.03‰ compared with a value of -29.78‰
    used in previous studies (Farquhar et al. 1989). The isotopic ratios are expressed
    as delta values in parts per thousand and not as carbon isotope discrimination
    (Farquhar and Richards 1984) because the isotopic composition of carbon dioxide
    at the sites was not measured.

    area meter and the dry weight determined after drying at 70 °C for 48 h in a forced-draft
    oven. SLA was calculated as area per unit mass.

questions:
  qu1: Site information for both Coolgardie sites (description, mean rainfall and metres above sea level) has
    been sourced from the articles supplied. Is the same site information available for 'Kalgoorlie arboretum'
    and 'Nr. Kalgoorlie arboretum'? In particular, can you provide a short description of the site 'Nr. Kalgoorlie arboretum' and the coordinates?
  qu 3: In the raw data file 'Turner-Coolgardie_Kalgoorlie_xlsx' the column labeled
    'avC%' contains no values. I have interpreted the column directly to its right
    '1.Result' as the actual column for 'leaf carbon content'. Is this correct?
  qu 4: Trait values for 'leaf nitrogen content per area' in column labeled 'N(g/m2)'
    appear very high in comparison to other studies in AusTraits. The values in the
    column following labeled '1.Result' have a reasonable looking distribution assuming
    units are also 'g/m2.' Could you please clarify which column contains the appropriate
    values for leaf nitrogen content per area and elaborate why values in N(g/m2)
    appear high?
  qu 5: Are methods available for leaf_C_per_dry_mass?
