  description: To try and clarify whether leaf delta13C is inherently stable across
    environments or varies with environment, particularly rainfall, we measured the
    leaf delta13C of a number of Eucalyptus species in two common gardens varying
    in rainfall.
  collection_type: common_garden, field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: At two common gardens, 10-25 leaves, depending on size, were
    collected from four replicate trees of each species. Leaves were around 1 year
    old when collected.

    - To fill in missing location information for 'Nr. Coolgardie arboretum' and 'Nr.
    Kalgoorlie arboretum', the coordinates of closely located sites have been used.

  Coolgardie arboretum:
    Soil type: clay
    elevation (m): 417
    MAP (mm): 216
    latitude (deg): -30.95
    longitude (deg): 121.15
    description: The trees at Coolgardie were planted between 1974 and 1980 in a 5-m
      grid pattern. In August 2005, the trees at Coolgardie were 3-10 m in height
      (Table 1). Species were spaced such that the crowns of the individual trees
      did not touch.

      a bush site 1 km from the arboretum.

  methods: The delta13C was referenced against Vienna Peedee Belemnite on a scale
    normalized by assigning consensus values of -46.6 per mille to L-SVEC lithium
    carbonate and +1.95 per mille to NBS 19 calcium carbonate (Coplen et al. 2006).
    Using this referencing system, the delta13C of NBS 22 oil is -30.03 per mille
    compared with a value of -29.78 per mille used in previous studies (Farquhar et
    al. 1989). The isotopic ratios are expressed as delta values in parts per thousand
    and not as carbon isotope discrimination (Farquhar and Richards 1984) because
    the isotopic composition of carbon dioxide at the sites was not measured.
