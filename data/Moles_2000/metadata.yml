    title: Do small leaves expand faster than large leaves, and do shorter expansion
      times reduce herbivore damage?

  description: We tested whether species with small leaves take less time to expand
    their leaves than do species with large leaves, and whether a shorter leaf expansion
    phase is associated with reduced damage incurred from herbivores. Some other relevant
    traits (leaf size, hairiness and bitterness) were measured directly, and their
    cross-correlations with leaf expansion time were assessed
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: Three study sites were located in Ku-ring-gai Chase National
    Park in Sydney, Australia. Sites were chosen to include a variety of soil moisture
    and soil nutrient levels, in order to maximise species diversity. The first site
    (diatreme) was located on volcanic soils (33°33'53'S; 151°17'35'E), the second
    (heath) was on a sandstone ridge top (33°39'40'S; 151°13'59'E), and the third
    (terrace) was near a stream in a sandstone gully (33°39'50'S; 151°14'45'E). The
    diatreme site had the highest levels of phosphorus and nitrogen (646 mg g-1 total
    phosphorus; 0.41% nitrogen), and the terrace and heath sites had low levels of
    both nutrients (terrace; 144 mg g-1 total phosphorus; 0.08% nitrogen; heath 79
    mg g-1 total phosphorus; 0.05% nitrogen). All woody dicotyledonous species at
    each site that had at least 25 leaves beginning to expand in late August or early
    September 1998, and were represented by more than four individuals were included
    in this study (Appendix 1). A total of 51 species from 17 families were sampled.

traits:
- var_in: SLA
  unit_in: .na 
  trait_name: specific_leaf_area
  value_type: site_mean
  replicates: 4
  methods: SLA (specific leaf area) was determined from a sample of 25 leaves that
    had recently completed expansion for each species by dividing leaf area by dry
    weight.
- var_in: Leaf_area_(mm2)
  unit_in: mm2
  trait_name: leaf_area
  value_type: site_mean
  replicates: 4
  methods: Leaf area was determined by scanning 25 fully expanded leaves from each
    species, and analysing the images using Delta-T scan (Delta-T, Cambridge, UK).
- var_in: presence_of_hair_ on_mature_leaves

  methods: Leaves were considered hairy if any trichomes were visible to the naked eye. Categorised as present or absent.

questions: Lat long for diatreme is in the harbour. What are the units for sla? (I think may be mm2/mg as this unit placed the trait values in the centre of the sla distribution. Can you confirm that the values are species
  site means for 4 inididuals. In the manuscript it says you only chose speices with at
  least 4 individuals, but in the actual methods you only mentioned that it was the
  mean of 25 leaves. I attempted custom code to insert multiple site columns, did
  not end up working- data %>% filter(longitude == 151.233056) %>% mutate(site_name
  = "heath") %>% data %>% filter(longitude == 151.245833) %>% mutate(site_name = "terrace")
  %>% data %>% filter(longitude == 151.293056) %>% mutate(site_name = "diatreme")
