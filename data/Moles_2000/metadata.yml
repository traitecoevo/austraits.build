  description: We tested whether species with small leaves take less time to expand
    their leaves than do species with large leaves, and whether a shorter leaf expansion
    phase is associated with reduced damage incurred from herbivores. Some other relevant
    traits (leaf size, hairiness and bitterness) were measured directly, and their
    cross-correlations with leaf expansion time were assessed.

  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: Three study sites were located in Ku-ring-gai Chase National
    Park in Sydney, Australia. Sites were chosen to include a variety of soil moisture
    and soil nutrient levels, in order to maximise species diversity. The first site
    (diatreme) was located on volcanic soils (33 deg 33'53'S; 151 deg 17'35'E), the
    second (heath) was on a sandstone ridge top (33 deg 39'40'S; 151 deg 13'59'E),
    and the third (terrace) was near a stream in a sandstone gully (33 deg 39'50'S;
    151 deg 14'45'E). The diatreme site had the highest levels of phosphorus and nitrogen
    (646 ug g-1 total phosphorus; 0.41% nitrogen), and the terrace and heath sites
    had low levels of both nutrients (terrace; 144 ug g-1 total phosphorus; 0.08%
    nitrogen; heath 79 ug g-1 total phosphorus; 0.05% nitrogen). All woody dicotyledonous
    species at each site that had at least 25 leaves beginning to expand in late August
    or early September 1998, and were represented by more than four individuals were
    included in this study (Appendix 1). A total of 51 species from 17 families were
    sampled.

- var_in: SLA
  unit_in: mm2/mg
  trait_name: specific_leaf_area
  entity_type: population
  value_type: mean
  basis_of_value: measurement
  replicates: 4
  methods: SLA (specific leaf area) was determined from a sample of 25 leaves that
    had recently completed expansion for each species by dividing leaf area by dry
    weight.
- var_in: Leaf_area_(mm2)
  unit_in: mm2
  trait_name: leaf_area
  entity_type: population
  value_type: mean
  basis_of_value: measurement
  replicates: 4
  methods: Leaf area was determined by scanning 25 fully expanded leaves from each
    species, and analysing the images using Delta-T scan (Delta-T, Cambridge, UK).

  unit_in: .na
  trait_name: leaf_hairs_adult
  entity_type: species
  value_type: mode
  basis_of_value: expert_score
  replicates: .na
  methods: Leaves were considered hairy if any trichomes were visible to the naked
    eye. Categorised as present or absent.
