  description: Measurements of dimorphism between juvenile and adult leaves in shape
    and size, leaf mass per unit area, and vein frequency in a continent-wide sample
    of Angophora, Corymbia and Eucalyptus species to test whether heteroblasty in
    this group is an adaptation to shading by comparing the degree of juvenile-adult
    leaf dimorphism with the canopy closure of the habitat in which species occurred.
  collection_type: plantation
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: We quantified juvenile and adult leaf morphology by the aspect
    ratio (leaf length divided by maximum width) and an index of leaf size (the product
    of length and width), the most obvious features of heteroblasty in the eucalypts.
    Leaf anatomy was quantified by leaf mass per unit area (LMA) and the vein frequency.
    Variation in LMA summarises much of the interspecific spectrum of ecological strategies
    of leaf design (Wright et al. 2004; Poorter et al. 2009), whereas vein density
    often differs between species in shaded and non-shaded environments (Sack and
    Scoffoni 2013) and so could be reflected also in heteroblastic leaves. Trait values
    were taken from published data and from our own measurements (see below). Our
    final dataset contained morphological data for 457 species (six Angophora spp.,
    76 Corymbia spp. and 375 Eucalyptus spp.), LMA for 56 species (three Corymbia
    spp. and 53 Eucalyptus spp.), and vein density (measured as vein frequency) for
    93 species (one Angophora sp., two Corymbia spp. and 90 Eucalyptus spp.).

- var_in: vein frequency (veins per mm)
  unit_in: count/mm
  trait_name: vein_density
  value_type: site_mean
  replicates: 1-10
  methods: A range of 1-10 leaves were taken from each individual, totalling 2015
    leaves. 2013). Juvenile leaves were taken from seedlings, the basal nodes of small
    saplings, or epicormic growth on mature trees. Each leaf was stored in a sealed
    plastic pocket at 4 deg C and later micrographed on its adaxial surface under
    a dissecting microscope with transmitted light to reveal the veins. Vein frequency
    (veins mm-1) was measured by counting the number of veins intersecting the perimeter
    of a square (2 or 4mm on each side, depending on the size of the leaf) drawn on
    each micrograph using ImageJ. Each square was placed at the approximate midpoint
    between the midrib and margin, and at the middle of the leaf length, in accordance
    with the measurements taken by Brooker and Nicolle (2013). No leaves were chemically
    cleared in the micrographs used for vein frequency measurements. Veins were always
    clearly visible up to the third order, at the least.

  value_type: site_mean
  replicates: 1-10
  methods: Juvenile and adult samples taken from Currency Creek Arboretum in 2015
    were also used to measure and calculate LMA. To measure LMA, leaves were scanned
    at 600 dpi and area was measured using ImageJ (Schneider et al. 2012). Each leaf
    was oven dried at 60 deg C for 72 +/- 2 h and weighed. LMA was calculated as dry
    mass per unit area (gm-2), which included the petiole if present. Averages from
    multiple leaves were taken to characterise the species. Dimorphism

questions:
  contributor: There are two species for which TaxonStand wasn't able to find a match,
    Eucalyptus ophelia and Eucalyptus sp. Dorsiventralis. I've looked up variants
    of both names on Atlas of Living Australia and can't find any logical matches.
    Do you have different names for either of these? (We know that The Plant List is out of date, so don't worry about species marked as "unresolved" or "unknown" that are clearly correct names. An automated tool allowing name matching with names in the Australian Plant Census is in progress and once available, we'll switch to using that tool.)
