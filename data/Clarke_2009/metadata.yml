  description: Study documenting the post-fire response (resprouting and maturation
    times) of woody species in six contrasting formations in the New England Tableland
    Bioregion of eastern Australia. The formations are rainforest, wet sclerophyll
    forest, dry sclerophyll forests, grassy woodlands, rocky outcrops heaths and wet
    heaths.
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult, sapling (by trait)
  sampling_strategy: Six major vegetation formations that are prone to fire occur
    in the Bioregion; rainforest (RF) (Northern Warm Temperate Rainforest), wet sclerophyll
    forest (WSF) (Northern Escarpment Wet Sclerophyll Forests and Northern Escarpment
    Wet Sclerophyll Forest), dry sclerophyll forests (DSF) (New England Dry Scerophyll
    Forest, Northern Escarpment Dry Sclerophyll Forest and Northern Tableland Dry
    Sclerophyll Forest), grassy woodlands (GW) (Northern Grassy Woodlands), rocky
    outcrops heaths (RO) (Northern Montane Heaths) and wet heaths (WH) (Montane Bogs
    and Fens) (see Keith 2004). All habitats are prone to fires. Landscape scale fires
    in 2002 burnt into the more mesic wet sclerophyll forests and rainforests margins.
    The fire response of woody species was recorded both quantitatively and qualitatively
    from direct observations of species in the post-fire environment for 489 taxa
    where their crowns had been burned. Repeated observations from independent fires
    were used to give a level of confidence in allocating species to fire response
    groups. In a few instances, fire response was inferred from root structures and
    comparing this with observations of closely related species. Post-fire observations
    were spread over several years using planned experimental, planned and unplanned
    fire from 1996 to 2008. Many species were observed in more than one or two formations.
    In these species the primary habitat in which they were recorded was used to allocate
    them to a habitat for trait analyses. The growth form of all woody species was
    determined from field observations, flora records and published records and summarized
    into seven groups corresponding to stem type and then height classes. The sprouting
    ability of at least five individuals (killed or resprouts) for at least two independent
    shrub populations were recorded where possible. Species could generally be classified
    into resprouters (70 to 100% of individuals in the population resprout) or obligate
    seeders (less than 30% of individuals resprout) (Gill & Bradstock 1992), although
    a third 'variable' resprouting class was also present (Clarke et al. 2005). In
    addition to data on resprouting, the position of resprouting and the type of seed
    bank was assessed for each species so they could be placed into one of the seven
    fire functional groups or syndromes of Gill and Bradstock (1992). The minimum
    maturation times (time to seed set) of plants were observed from tagging seedling
    recruits in the post-fire environment or from observations of flowering and fruiting
    of species after fire.

    description: Species were sampled from six major vegetation formations that are

      Rainforest), wet sclerophyll forest (WSF) (Northern Escarpment Wet Sclerophyll

      and wet heaths (WH) (Montane Bogs and Fens) (see Keith 2004).
    fire history: Landscape scale fires in 2002 burnt into the more mesic wet sclerophyll
      forests and rainforests margins.
    georeference remarks: There were no particular sites or latitudes reported in
      the study. The latitude given is approximately the centre of the bioregion.
