traits:
- var_in: ^1-O (Mpa)
  unit_in: MPa
  trait_name: osmotic_potential 
  value_type: raw_value
  replicates: 1
  methods: (osmotic potential) Turgor loss point and osmotic potential were measured as described by Bartlett et al. (2012). Osmotic potential was measured using a WP4C Dewpoint PotentiaMeter (Decagon Devices, Inc., Pullman, WA, USA).
- var_in: _w (Mpa)
  unit_in: MPa
  trait_name: water_potential_midday 
  value_type: raw_value
  replicates: 1
  methods: Leaf water potential was measured by obtaining by using a pressure chamber (PMS, Corvallis, Oregon, USA).
- var_in: ^1-tlp (Mpa)
  unit_in: MPa
  trait_name: leaf_turgor_loss_point
  value_type: raw_value
  replicates: 1
  methods: Turgor loss point and osmotic potential were measured as described by Bartlett et al. (2012). Osmotic potential was measured using a WP4C Dewpoint PotentiaMeter (Decagon Devices, Inc., Pullman, WA, USA).
- var_in: WD (mg mm-3)
  unit_in: mg/mm3
  trait_name: wood_density
  value_type: raw_value
  replicates: 1
  methods: Wood density was calculated using Archimedes' method (Cornelissen et al. 2003)
- var_in: LA (cm2)
  unit_in: cm2
  trait_name: leaf_area
  value_type: raw_value
  replicates: 1
  methods: Leaf area (LA). Individual leaf laminae were measured without petiole or rachis by scanning each leaf and using the software ImageJ (Version 1.52k). 
- var_in: LDM (g)
  unit_in: g
  trait_name: leaf_dry_mass
  value_type: raw_value
  replicates: 1
  methods: Leaf dry mass (LDM). Leaves were freeze-dried for 72 hours (h) and weighed to determine their dry mass
- var_in: SLA (cm2 mg-1)
  unit_in: m2/kg
  trait_name: specific_leaf_area
  value_type: raw_value
  replicates: 1
  methods: Specific leaf area (SLA) was calculated by dividing the surface area of the fresh leaf and dry mass (Cornelissen et al. 2003)
- var_in: HV (m-4)
  unit_in: mm2/mm2
  trait_name: huber_value
  value_type: raw_value
  replicates: 1
  methods: The Huber value (HV) as the ratio of the sapwood cross-sectional area to the supported leaf area distal to the measured branch segment.
- var_in: _13C (a)
  unit_in: per mille
  trait_name: leaf_delta13C
  value_type: raw_value
  replicates: 1
  methods: Two to three leaves per tree were collected and dried using a freezer-dryer ALPHA 1-4 LD Plus for 48 h. Analyses conducted in the Farquhar Laboratort, Research School of Biology, Australian National University, ACT, 2601, Australia.
- var_in: NL (%)
  unit_in: '%'
  trait_name: leaf_N_per_dry_mass
  value_type: raw_value
  replicates: 1
  methods: Leaf nitrogen content - Two to three leaves per tree were collected and dried using a freezer-dryer ALPHA 1-4 LD Plus for 48 h. Analyses conducted in the Farquhar Laboratort, Research School of Biology, Australian National University, ACT, 2601, Australia.
