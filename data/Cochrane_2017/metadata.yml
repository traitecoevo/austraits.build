  description: A study of 26 eucalypts to understand how small increases in temperature
    during seed germination may threaten species by altering germination timing and
    success.
  basis_of_record: lab
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: Twenty-six Eucalyptus species with varying life history characteristics
    and conservation status were selected for investigation (Fig. 1; Table 1). Seeds
    were collected from the wild across southern Western Australia over a period of
    10 years from a broad range of individuals and subsequently stored under genebank
    conditions (cool and dry) until use. Eucalyptus seeds are generally held in the
    canopy in woody capsules. The seeds are mostly small and lack any feature that
    aids seed dispersal (Boland, Brooker and Turnbull 1980). Seed dormancy is not
    a common characteristic of Western Australian Eucalyptus species (Bell 1999),
    unlike some cool climate species from higher elevations in eastern Australia that
    may be dormant on dispersal and require cold chilling to overcome dormancy (Battaglia
    1993, Battaglia 1997, Close and Wilson 2002, Mok et al. 2012). Seed release occurs
    when capsules dry and valves open and can be accelerated by drought or fire. Mature,
    viable Eucalyptus seeds from the region generally germinate freely once the requisite
    conditions of temperature, moisture and substrate combine to stimulate germination.
    ^p Environmental variables ^p The average monthly minimum and maximum temperatures
    for each seed source site were used as proxies for thermal tolerance and were
    obtained from WorldClim, a set of global climate layers with a spatial resolution
    of approximately 1 km2 (Hijmans et al. 2005). The data for 'current' conditions
    were derived from 1950-2000 averages. Future projections for the same climate
    variables were downloaded from the downscaled Hadley Centre Global Environment
    Model version 2 (HadGEM2-ES; http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/modelling-systems/unified-model/climate-models/hadgem2)
    using a high greenhouse gas emission scenario (Representative Concentration Pathway,
    RCP85) for 2070. The RCP85 scenario reflects high energy demand and greenhouse
    gas emission without climate change policies (Moss et al. 2010). This scenario
    is extreme but reflects a likely climate outcome given the current level of mitigation
    activity. The HadGEM2-ES model (Jones et al. 2011) includes dynamic vegetation,
    ocean biology and atmospheric chemistry, and has previously been used in simulating
    germination response in native species (Fern√°ndez-Pascual et al. 2015, Cochrane
    2016), including use in the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel
    on Climate Change (IPPC, 2013). ^p Experimental design ^p A bi-directional temperature
    gradient plate (TGP) (GRD1, Grant Instruments, Cambridge, UK) was used to deliver
    196 different temperature combinations (constant and alternating) simultaneously.
    The TGP method was chosen in order to detect thresholds more accurately than step-wise
    temperatures delivered by incubators, characterizing a fuller spectrum of responses
    to future temperature scenarios. Seeds were sown in 30 mm plastic Petri dishes
    on 0.75% w/v water agar. Seed numbers per dish ranged from 14 to 20 depending
    on species, and each species was exposed to 49 temperature combinations with a
    12-h photoperiod for 6 weeks (four species per run of the TGP). There was no capacity
    to replicate temperature conditions on the TGP but each species was represented
    by between ca 700-1000 seeds. Seed germination was checked three times weekly
    and germinated seeds showing a radicle at least double the length of the seed
    were removed. Percentage germination was calculated as the percentage of viable
    seeds that germinated within the incubation period. Seeds with a hard, white endosperm
    were considered potentially viable; empty seeds were removed from the original
    count. The experiments were carried out over a period of years from 2007 to 2016.
