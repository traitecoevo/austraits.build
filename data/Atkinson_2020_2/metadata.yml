  description: Study aims to investigate how leaf traits may determine ecological
    restoration outcomes. (unpublished PhD data)
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: Plants were sampled from a single restoration site from 4-5 leaves
    per individual. Fully-developed leaves in full sun  were used. (Note, all sites
    are direct-seeded former agricultural land. Locations are accurate to 100 m, points
    were taken at first individual in area only. A fridge/freezer mishap resulted
    in the destruction of many samples, therefore some species only have a couple
    of individuals - included anyway since may be useful for calculating species averages
    where others have measured the same species.)

  methods: Leaf area was calculated using the EasyLeafArea app, calibrated using a
    known size scale. Care was taken to avoid skewed camera angles that may introduce
    error to area estimates.

  replicates: 1
  methods: Leaves were oven-dried at 60 degrees celcius for 72 hrs then weighed immediately.
    This weight was then divided by the leaf area (mm2/mg).
