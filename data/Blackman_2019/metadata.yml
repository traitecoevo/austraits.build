  description: Study investigating the time for plants to reach critical levels of
    hydraulic failure, in order to predict the probability of mortality at an individual
    and landscape scale.
  basis_of_record: lab
  life_stage: sapling
  sampling_strategy: Species ^p Eight species of Eucalyptus were chosen to test whether
    plant desiccation times are predictable using the tcrit model. These species represent
    a wide range of drought tolerances (Li et al., 2018a) that were predicted to generate
    a wide range of desiccation times. The eight species are dominant forest trees,
    representing four major vegetation types within southeastern and central Australia
    (Table 1). Climatic conditions calculated across each species distribution vary
    widely, with mean annual precipitation (MAP) ranging from 333 to 1436 mm and mean
    annual temperature ranging from 13.2 to 18.8°C (Table 1). ^p Experimental design
    ^p Plants from eight Eucalyptus species were grown under well-watered, common
    garden conditions inside a polytunnel growth facility (Richmond, NSW, Australia).
    Seed was sourced from the Australian Tree Seed Centre in May 2017 and germinated
    at Greening Australia's production nursery located in Richmond, NSW Australia.
    On 21 September 2017, following roughly 4 months of growth, 15-20 seedlings per
    species were moved to a polytunnel growth facility located at the Hawkesbury campus
    of Western Sydney University (Richmond, NSW, Australia) and transplanted into
    25 l woven bags filled with a native loamy sand top-soil (Menangle, NSW, Australia),
    supplemented with slow-release fertilizer. Bags were placed onto pallets to avoid
    root contact with the soil. Planting layout followed a split-block design, with
    three to four plants per species randomly positioned within each block. A single
    row of border plants consisted of randomly selected species. Plants were irrigated
    every second day to ensure soil water content remained at field capacity. A weather
    station consisting of a data-logger (CR300; Campbell Scientific Inc., Logan, UT,
    USA) connected to a light sensor (Decagon Devices Inc., Pullman, WA, USA), and
    temperature/relative humidity probe (HMP60-L; Campbell Scientific Inc.) was installed
    at 1.5 m above the ground and recorded temperature (°C) and relative humidity
    every 5 min throughout the experiment. During the experimental period, mean daily
    photon flux density was 6.67 mol, mean daily temperature was 22.6°C, and mean
    daily relative humidity was 64.3%.^p In March 2018, after c. 7 months of growth
    under well-watered conditions, plants of each species were separated into three
    subgroups based on whether they showed relatively fast (group 1, consisting of
    Eucalyptus blakleyi, Eucalyptus grandis, and Eucalyptus viminalis), moderate (group
    2, consisting of Eucalyptus melliodora and Eucalyptus sideroxylon), or slow (group
    3, consisting of Eucalyptus largiflorens, Eucalyptus macrorhyncha, and Eucalyptus
    populnea) growth. We subsequently staggered the commencement of plant dry-down
    across the three groups, with plants from group 1 commencing in early March, group
    2 in late March, and group 3 in early April. This process helped ensure plants
    were relatively uniform in size across species and large enough to minimize the
    effect of leaf sampling on plant dry-down times. At the start of each dry-down
    experiment, average plant height was 141 cm, 106 cm, and 160 cm for E. blakelyi,
    E. grandis, and E. viminalis, respectively; 144 cm and 154 cm for E. melliodora
    and E. sideroxylon, respectively; and 132 cm, 172 cm, and 100 cm for E. largiflorens,
    E. macrorhyncha, and E. populnea, respectively. ^p All plants were drought hardened
    by withholding water until early signs of leaf wilt were present, after which
    they were rewatered and allowed to recover for 46 d. This process was designed
    to increase species drought tolerance (Bartlett et al., 2014) and reduce the likelihood
    that plants would suffer from drought 'shock' during the early stages of dehydration.
    At the end of this recovery period, between four and six plants per species were
    designated for a range of trait measurements, including specific leaf area, saturated
    water content, leaf pressure-volume analysis, shoot capacitance, minimum leaf
    conductance, and leaf hydraulic vulnerability. Water was withheld from the remaining
    plants per species (n = 5-12), after which they were allowed to deplete available
    soil water and dehydrate.

  methods: minimum leaf conductance; The minimum leaf conductance gmin was calculated from two detached leaves
    from each of three randomly selected drought-hardened individuals per species.
    Each leaf was scanned for leaf area, weighed using a precision balance, and the
    cut petiole sealed with wax before being pegged to a line of string suspended
    inside a climate-controlled growth chamber. The temperature and relative humidity
    inside the chamber were set to 20°C and 70%, respectively. Leaves were dried for
    a period of 7-10 h under low light conditions (200 umol m-2 s-1), with inbuilt
    fans blowing air across the leaf surface. During this time, leaves were weighed
    approximately every hour. Minimum conductance was calculated from the slope of
    the linear part of the leaf mass vs time relationship and converted to units of
    mmol m-2 s-1 in conjunction with chamber VPD (mol mol-1) and double-sided leaf
    area.

  methods: The relationship between plant water potential and RWC was determined by
    drying-down shoots from full hydration to water potentials equal to or below psi-crit.
    The entire aboveground shoots of three plants per species (n = 3) were excised
    at predawn and immediately placed in large plastic bags and transported to the
    laboratory. At this time, plant water potential was > -0.1 MPa for all species.
    Two leaves per shoot were excised and placed in a Scholander-type pressure chamber
    for water potential determination. In all cases, shoots were well hydrated (water
    potential > -0.1 MPa). The shoot was then weighed on an open-top 0.01 g balance
    (MS3002S; Mettler Toledo, Columbus, OH, USA) and allowed to dehydrate on the bench
    over the course of 3-6 d, during which time water potential and shoot mass were
    measured repeatedly. Before each measurement, shoots were placed inside large
    plastic bags for c. 1 h to aid water potential equilibration. Nevertheless, it
    was assumed that leaf and stem water potential were in close equilibrium beyond
    the stomatal closure point. At the end of the dry-down experiment, leaves and
    stems were oven-dried and weighed for total dry mass determination. For species
    trait comparisons, a measure of the post leaf turgor loss shoot capacitance (mol
    kg-1 MPa-1) was calculated for each species by dividing the linear portion of
    the post turgor loss RWC vs psi relationship by total maximum water content and
    dry mass (Table S1).

    was calculated as projected leaf area divided by leaf dry mass (for species mean
    SLA values, see Table S1), and the leaf saturated water content (g g-1) was calculated
    as (leaf saturated mass - leaf dry mass)/leaf dry mass. The saturated water content
    (g g-1) of the three shoots per species was calculated as (shoot hydrated mass
    - shoot dry mass)/shoot dry mass. Meanwhile, a small 3-5 cm section of root was
    excised from the same plants per species and submersed in water for 2 h. Fully
    hydrated root sections were then blotted dry with a paper towel and weighed for
    saturated mass and then oven-dried and weighed for dry mass. The saturated water

    dry mass.
