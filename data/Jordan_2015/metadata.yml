  description: Data to test whether generic changes in cell size cause suboptimal
    changes in stomata, requiring subsequent evolution under selection for stomatal
    size.
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: The plants sampled for genome size were collected from a mixture
    of wild-grown and cultivated plants grown from native stock. Samples were collected
    from a wide range of regions within Australia, ranging from tropical North Queensland
    to the Mediterranean climate region of Western Australia to alpine Tasmania.

traits:
- var_in: ploidy level
  unit_in: count
  trait_name: ploidy
  value_type: site_mean
  replicates: 10
  methods: Genome sizes were estimated from samples (c. 1 cm2) of expand-ing foliage.
    Incompletely expanded leaves were used because of the highly sclerophyllous nature
    of many Proteaceae. For each sample, runs were replicated on different days. The
    samples of the target species and reference plant were co-chopped with a double-sided
    razor blade in a precooled Petri dish containing 200 ul woody plant buffer (WPB,
    Loureiro et al., 2007b) with 3% PVP-10 (WPB2) as per Beatson et al. (2003). From
    these preparations, nuclei were isolated and stained using the Cystain PI Absolute
    P Kit (Partec, Munster, Germany) with the following modification, the kit extraction
    buffer was replaced with WPB2. An additional 200 ul of WPB2 was added and the
    nuclei suspen-sion filtered through a 20 um Celltrics filter (Partec). Before
    analysis, the suspension was incubated for between 30 and 60 min, with 1.6 ml
    staining buffer containing propidium iodide (PI) and RNAse. The genome size of
    each species was determined on a CyFlow Ploidy Analyser (Partec) with DNA-PI script
    parameters, L-L 0.30, speed 0.4 ul s-1 and gain c. 360. Pisum sativum 'Torstag'
    (2x = 9.49 pg) was used as the refer-ence plant for all samples except those of
    Bellendena montana. The peaks for B. montana and P. sativum were very close, so
    using P. sativum as reference would lead to ambiguity in the estimated genome
    size. A single cultivated plant of Acacia auriculiformis (2x = 1.77 pg) was used
    as a reference for B. montana. At least two estimates were made for each species
    on different days. The nuclear size was estimated according to the formula of
    Loureiro et al. (2007a). To ensure consistency with the Kew Database of genome
    sizes, reference values were determined based on 10 runs relative to a diploid
    nuclear value of 9.56 pg for P. sativum 'Minerva Maple' (Galbraith & Lambert,
    2012).
