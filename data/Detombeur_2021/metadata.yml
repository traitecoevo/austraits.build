  description: Leaf concentrations of total phenols and silicon (Si) was measured
    in plants growing along the 2-29 million-year Jurien Bay chronosequence, exhibiting
    an extreme gradient of soil fertility, to explore if plants adapted to infertile
    soils have high levels of anti-herbivore leaf defenses.

  sampling_strategy: The 2 Ma Jurien Bay chronosequence is located in south-western
    Australia, approximately 200 km north of Perth (Fig. S1), and is described in
    detail in Laliberte et al. (2012) and Turner & Laliberte (2015). The chronosequence,
    part of the Swan Coastal Plain, comprises a series of dunes parallel to the coast,
    formed by periodic interglacial sea-level high-stands since the Early Pleistocene/Late
    Pliocene (Kendrick et al. 1991), with a clear gradient of soil age with increasing
    distance from the Indian Ocean. The dunes comprise three units, the Quindalup
    dunes date from the Holocene (up to 7 ka), the Spearwood dunes from the Middle
    Pleistocene (120 to 500 ka) and the Bassendean dunes from the Early Pleistocene
    or Late Pliocene (~2 Ma) (McArthur & Bettenay 1974; Playford et al. 1976). The
    parent material of the dunes is calcareous sand from the nearshore coastal environment
    (Turner & Laliberte 2015). The climate is Mediterranean, with a mean annual temperature
    of 19 deg C, mean annual rainfall 533 mm and potential annual evapotranspiration
    of 1433 mm, which results in a water balance of 900 mm yr-1 (data from the Jurien
    Bay Bureau of Meteorology from 1968 to 2015 in Turner et al. (2018). ^p  We selected
    the same five chronosequence stages as in Hayes et al. (2014); these include both
    the early and retrogressive phases of long-term ecosystem development. The main
    soil properties of these five stages can be found in Table 1. Soil total P and
    carbonate concentrations, cation exchange capacity and pH-CaCl2 continually decrease
    with increasing soil age. Soil total N concentrations increase from stage 1 to
    stage 2 during the progressive phase of ecosystem development, then decrease towards
    the last stages during the retrogressive phase (Laliberte et al. 2012; Turner
    & Laliberte 2015). Plant growth is most strongly limited by low N availability
    in the early stages, and by P availability in the advanced stages (Laliberte et
    al. 2012; Hayes et al. 2014). Previous studies showed that plant-available [Si]
    is low in the early stages of soil development, increases in stage 4 in the Spearwood
    dune system, and finally decreases in the oldest stage of soil development, where
    it is controlled by intense biocycling (Table 1) (de Tombeur et al. 2020b, c).  ^p
    Site selection  ^p For each chronosequence stage, we randomly selected five plots
    (10 m x 10 m each) among the 10 plots already characterized for soil and vegetation
    in previous studies (Hayes et al. 2014; Zemunik et al. 2016) (Fig. S1). The plots
    were originally selected using a random stratified sampling design (Zemunik et
    al. 2016). To characterize vegetation, seven 2 m x 2 m subplots were randomly
    positioned in each plot in which all individuals of all vascular plant species
    were counted (Zemunik et al. 2016). The percent canopy cover of each species was
    estimated, and the relative cover of each species was calculated as a fraction
    of the total canopy cover over the seven subplots (Zemunik et al. 2016). ^p Sampling
    procedure  ^p In the 25 plots selected, we sampled leaves according to two procedures.
    First, we sampled leaves from one individual plant for each of the 10 most-abundant
    species of each plot as defined in Zemunik et al. (2016). The number of leaves
    sampled per individual was adapted according to their mass, but was never less
    than 10. Occasionally, a species originally included in the 10 most abundant species
    was not found on the plot, which resulted in less than 10 species for some plots
    (Table S1). The 234 species sampled with this first procedure still accounted
    for 57% to 88% of the total cover of each plot (Table S1). The community-level
    analyses were performed only on these species. Second, we systematically sampled
    the species belonging to nine families, even if they were not included in the
    10 most-abundant species, in order to study family-level variation in leaf [Si]
    and [phenols], following the same sampling procedure, Asparagaceae, Cyperaceae,
    Ericaceae, Fabaceae, Haemodoraceae, Myrtaceae, Poaceae, Restionaceae and Rhamnaceae
    (Table S2). These families were selected because they were well represented and
    found at all stages of the chronosequence (Zemunik et al. 2016), and likely had
    contrasting [Si] based on known phylogenetic patterns (Hodson et al. 2005). In
    total, 298 leaf samples belonging to 24 families were collected (Tables S1 and
    S2). All leaf material was collected over two weeks in November 2018. Leaves were
    sampled from one healthy mature individual plant per species in each plot; when
    an individual did not provide sufficient biomass for analysis (e.g., Poaceae spp.),
    leaf samples from several individuals within the plot were combined.

  methods: Leaves were washed with distilled water, dried at 70C for 48 h and finely
    ground. Leaf material (0.5 g) was placed in a porcelain crucible and calcinated
    at 450C for 24 h. The weight after calcination was used to calculate the ash content.
    The ash was mixed with 1.6 g lithium-metaborate and 0.4 g of lithium-tetraborate
    in a graphite crucible and heated at 1000C for 5 min (Chao & Sanzolone 1992).
    The bead was then dissolved in 15% HNO3 and the concentrations of Si, P, calcium
    (Ca), magnesium (Mg) and potassium (K) were determined by inductively coupled
    plasma-optical emission spectrometry (Agilent Technologies, 700 series ICP-OES).
