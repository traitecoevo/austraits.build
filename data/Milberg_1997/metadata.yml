  description: Seed mass and seed nutrient data from a study to examine the importance
    of seed size in the early establishment of seedlings of four cotyledonous species
    restricted to nutrient-impoverished soils in south-western Australia.
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: Fruits of Eucalyptus todtiana F. Muell. and Hakea psilorrhyncha
    R. M. Barker were collected from scrub-heath on sandy soil at Eneabba, 280 km
    north of Perth, Western Australia. At this site there were no other eucalypts
    present and H. psilorrhyncha was the dominant Hakea. Sand was collected from the
    same site and was taken from the uppermost 150 mm (after scraping away decomposing
    litter). Fruits of Eucalyptus loxophleba Benth. and Hakea circumalata Meissn.
    were collected from eucalypt woodland on a loamy soil at Watheroo National Park,
    220 km north-north-east of Perth. These were the only species in their genera
    present at this site. Soil was collected from around both species. The nutrient
    status of the two soils used is described in Table 1.

  methods: To minimize phenotypic variation within treat- ments, eucalypt seeds were
    collected from a single large plant, and each fruit contributed between one (E.
    todtiana) and several seeds (E. loxophleba). There are normally two seeds in each
    fruit of Hakea, and several adjacent individuals contributed to these seed batches.
    Fruits were air-dried immediately after harvest, seeds were extracted, and their
    mass was established by individually weighing 25 seeds. Hence, the seed masses
    reported are of the seeds used in the experiment and do not necessarily represent
    the average seed mass of these species.

  methods: 1 g of seeds was re-dried, milled to pass through a 1-mm sieve and sealed
    in vials for nutrient analysis. Nitrogen was determined on a four-channel autoanalyser
    system, using modifi- cations of the Technicon procedure (Anonymous, 1977), colorimetrically
    by the indophenol blue method after digestion with sulphuric acid and hydrogen
    peroxide (Yuen & Pollard, 1954).
