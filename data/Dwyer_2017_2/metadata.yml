  description: We investigated plant community responses 8 years after thinning in
    densely resprouting brigalow (Acacia harpophylla) forests in Australia. We examined
    the abundance, diversity, composition, and size of all woody recruits, as well
    as the functional composition of woody plant assemblages using functional traits.
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: Four treatments were applied to 25 x 25 m plots in a randomized block design; control (no thinning) 
   and random thinning (ringbarking) down to 4,000, 2,000, and 1,000 stems/ha. Reference plots were also established in a nearby mature forest. 
   These plots were established between October 2006 and March 2007. To compare functional compositions among the experimental and reference plots, three functional traits were measured 
   on as many woody species as possible. The trait samples were mainly collected from the mature reference forest, but not in specific reference forest plots. 
   We focused on the mature reference forest because many species occurred exclusively in this forest (many species were 
   absent in regrowth plots).

    longitude (deg): 150.922670
    rainfall (mm): 625
    description: Brigalow refers to Acacia harpophylla, a long-lived Acacia growing
      to 25m under optimal conditions (Boland et al. 1992), and to the open forests
      and woodlands in which A. harpophylla is a characteristic species. Lower layers
      of small trees and shrubs are common but herbaceous ground vegetation is always
      sparse, resulting in very low fire fuel loads (Moore et al. 1967). Rainfall
      in the region of Bulli State Forest is variable and summer dominant, averaging
      625 mm/year. Average daily minimum and maximum temperatures are 11.6 and 25.9°C,
      respectively (Jeffrey et al. 2001). Most brigalow forests in the locality have
      been cleared. The remaining patches of mature forests and regrowth occur on
      fertile vertosol (cracking clay) soils, mainly along the edge of the state forest
      where it abuts pasture and cropping (Fig. 1). A number of structural and floristic
      attributes of the regrowth (prethinning) and mature forests at the study site
      have been presented previously (Chandler et al. 2007). In the mature forests
      A. harpophylla and C. cristata form a canopy between 16 and 20m tall with a
      foliage projective cover (FPC, vertical projection of canopy foliage) of 75%.
      Acacia harpophylla is more abundant but C. cristata stems are larger on average
      and this species contributes three times more aboveground biomass (Table 1).
      The average density of canopy tree species (almost all A. harpophylla and C.
      cristata) is 1,488 stems/ha (Table 1).

  methods: We measured specific leaf area (SLA), stem-specific density, and seed mass
    following published protocols (Perez-Harguindeguy et al. 2013).
- var_in: stem_specific_density
  unit_in: g/cm3
  trait_name: wood_density
  value_type: raw_value
  replicates: 1
  methods: Stem-specific density is the ratio of dry mass to green volume of a section
    of stem and represents a species' investment in wood and bark biomass. Stem-specific
    density was measured on 10 cm long sections of stems (for shrubs) and branches
    (for trees). Bark was left on all samples (only loose bark was removed) and the
    fresh volume was calculated using the water displacement method. Samples were
    then oven dried at 100°C for 72 hours to obtain dry weights.
