  description: John Morgan Grassy woodland trait database
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: These data come from multiple native temperate tussock grasslands  dominated
    by Themeda triandra across the Victorian Volcanic Plain, western Victoria (from
    Melbourne to Hamilton)
  original_file: relevent data from the file "2014  updated plant functional trait
    database.xls" extracted. Original copy of the excel file located in Google Drive
    in the folder "Morgan_2011_1 Morgan_2011_2 Morgan_2014 Angevin_2010 Briggs_2010
    Cross_2011 Lunt_2012 Roberts_2006 Scott_2010"
  notes: 35 SLA values that are duplicates of values in Meers_2010 and 68 seed mass
    values that are duplicates of various studies, Meers_2010, Cross_2009, Angevin_2011,
    Leishman_1992, and Kew_2019 were filtered out
