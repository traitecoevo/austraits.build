  description: One of the important features for wood pulping is the wood structure
    and anatomy, including cell biometry and cell type proportion. This work makes
    a prospective study of nine eucalypt species aiming at a pulping use by an early
    assessment of wood anatomical features.
  basis_of_record: captive_cultivated
  life_stage: sapling
  sampling_strategy: The study was done on nine Eucalyptus species, E. camaldulensis,
    E. globulus, E. maculata, E. melliodora, E. ovata, E. propinqua, E. sideroxylon,
    E. tereticornis, and E. viminalis. The trees were grown on an experimental site
    located in the campus fields of the School of Agriculture, University of Lisbon
    (ULisbon), at Tapada da Ajuda, Lisboa, Portugal (38°42'N; 09°10'W). The region
    is under the influence of a mesothermal humid climate, with a dry season in the
    summer extending from June to August, and registering above 10°C in the coldest
    month and below or equal to 22°C in the hottest month. The soil is a Vertisol
    characterized by a fine, or medium to fine, texture, derived from tuffs or basalts,
    frequently with limestone on the inferior horizons, or from calcareous rock (in
    much less extension). The trees were planted from seeds originated from Australia
    in February 2007 in rows with 3 m x 3 m spacing and without fertilization. The
    trees were harvested in April 2011, at 50 months of age. Stem discs with 10 cm
    thickness were collected at 1.30 m of tree height (DBH). The mean overbark and
    wood diameters were measured. Two replicates per species were analyzed.

  methods: The vessel area was determined from pith to bark, after sample surface
    sanding, using the Leica software Qwin V 3.5.0, after acquisition of a sequence
    of images of each radius through a digital camera Leica DFC 320 coupled to Leica
    Magnifier MZ6. The images were converted to binary format and vessels were clearly
    identified as separate objects after applying threshold and minimum size settings.
    The individual size of all the vessels contained along the full length of the
    radial strip and within a 1-mm-width field was recorded. The number of vessels,
    the individual vessel area and the vessel location coordinates were recorded per
    image and positioned along the radial strip total length. The following mean vessel
    variables were calculated, average vessel area, number of vessels, vessel density
    (number of vessels per mm2) and vessel proportion (vessel area percentage in relation
    to total area).

  methods: For microscopy, samples were taken at three radial positions at 30%, 60%
    and 90% of the radius from pith to cambium. The wood samples were first softened
    in boiling water and then sectioned with a sliding microtome. Transversal, tangential
    and radial thin sections with 17 um thickness were obtained using a micrometre,
    washed in alcohol, stained with safranin and mounted in Eukitt. Ray height and
    number of cells were measured from 40 uniseriate rays, on the tangential sections.
    The radial variation of fibre length, width and wall thickness was measured on
    dissociated material (40 fibres per determination) using image analysis assisted
    by a camera from Leica microscope coupled to EC3 transmitted light Dialux 22 EB
    and LAS software V4.2. Only complete fibres were measured and fibre width and
    lumen were determined at mid-length. Cell dissociation was made with Jeffrey's
    solution during 48 h at 60 °C, washed in water and stored in 70% alcohol. The
    proportion of axial parenchyma, fibres, rays and vessels was measured on the transverse
    sections using a 48 point-grid on successive areas along the radius and using
    LAS software V4.2. The determination was made directly on the microscope where
    the different tissues differentiate clearly by size and colour.

    by a camera from Leica microscope coupled to EC3 transmitted light Dialux 22 EB
    and LAS software V4.2. Only complete fibres were measured and fibre width and
    lumen were determined at mid-length. Cell dissociation was made with Jeffrey's
    solution during 48 h at 60 °C, washed in water and stored in 70% alcohol. The
    proportion of axial parenchyma, fibres, rays and vessels was measured on the transverse
    sections using a 48 point-grid on successive areas along the radius and using
    LAS software V4.2. The determination was made directly on the microscope where
    the different tissues differentiate clearly by size and colour.
