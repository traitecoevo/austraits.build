  description: An investigation of reproductive allocation (RA) and other morphological
    and physiological characters in Gynatrix pulchella, a dimorphic species that we
    found ranges from dioecious to subdioecious or gynodioecious, depending on season
    and locality.
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: Gynatrix pulchella (Willd.) Alef. (Malvaceae), or hemp bush,
    is a spreading, reportedly dioecious, evergreen shrub growing up to 4 m high.
    Three  populations of G. pulchella were studied in the Australian Capital Territory,
    Australia. Tidbinbilla Nature Reserve; Orroral Valley in Namadgi National Park;
    and Googong Dam Foreshores. At Tidbinbilla, a large population grew in low-lying,
    drainage areas and along creek beds in wet sclerophyll forest. Here, G. pulchella
    plants existed as tall understorey shrubs, somewhat shaded by the taller eucalypt
    canopy, with a small number growing in minor clearings. The plants growing at
    Orroral Valley also occurred along a creek line, shaded by a eucalypt overstorey,
    but were generally smaller and had thinner canopies. This population was scattered
    across a broader area than Tidbinbilla. The Googong Dam site contrasted with the
    other two by being exposed to full sun and wind. This population existed as a
    single-species stand with a few outlying individuals growing on the edge of a
    narrow gorge containing a small creek. In the spring/summer of 2000, we conducted
    a study on 20 plants (10 males, 10 females) at Tidbinbilla. This study involved
    morphological, physiological and allocation measurements. In 2002, we repeated
    the allocation measurements on the 20 original plants plus 107 additional plants
    at Tidbinbilla, and on the populations at Googong and Orroral Valley. At Tidbinbilla,
    we sampled 127 plants (70 males, 57 females) in an area running approximately
    200 m along a creek bed and 30 m either side of the water's edge. At Orroral Valley,
    we sampled 68 plants (40 males, 28 females) within an area running approximately
    300 m along a creek and 10 m either side. At Googong, 103 plants (55 males, 48
    females) were sampled. This population was clustered along approximately 30 m
    of the gorge, with the majority of plants not more than 3 m from the edge, and
    a few scattered individuals up to 80 m from the main group. At each site, all
    reproductively active individuals within the defined areas were sampled. Although
    resprouting occurs in this species, clonality was ruled out by tracing each leading
    stem back to a discreet root system and single individuals were identified among
    closely spaced plants in all three locations.

  methods: 'Gas exchange measurements were conducted on the 20 original study plants
    at Tidbinbilla at three periods: in November 2000 during flowering; when females
    were fruiting in December; and in January after most fruits had dehisced. Measurements
    were made on three young, fully expanded leaves per plant. All leaves were fully
    expanded and of similar age (three to five nodes down from the apical meristem).
    Selected leaves were those that received maximum direct sunlight given the position
    of the plant, i.e. generally facing north-east. In nearly all cases, the same
    leaf was used for all sampling periods. In the final sampling period when most
    fruits had dehisced, three of the 60 sample leaves had disappeared; in these cases
    a new leaf was selected, adjacent to the original leaf, and facing a similar angle.
    Measurements were made using a LI-COR 6400 portable photosynthesis system (LI-COR
    Inc.). Light was provided with the LI-COR chamber-mounted Red/Blue light source.
    Saturating light level for G. pulchella was determined via a series of preliminary
    light response curves and set for measurements at a photon flux density of 1800
    umol m-2 s-1. Relative humidity ranged between 50 and 70%. We conducted measurements
    between the hours of 08.30 and 14.30 and ceased when leaf temperatures reached
    36 deg C. During November and December, maximum air temperatures ranged from 25
    to 37 deg C, and reached 42 deg C in January. We tested for variation in gas exchange
    among leaves from a single flush by taking measurements on a number of sample
    leaves at various nodes along a branch. We found the variation among leaves from
    different nodes on the same branch to be similar to the variation among leaves
    from the same nodes on different branches, suggesting that within a season, the
    effects of leaf age on gas exchange were negligible.'

  methods: To assess patterns of biomass allocation within leaves we measured specific
    leaf area (SLA m2 g-1 leaf tissue) at Tidbinbilla in 2000 on the 20 study plants
    plus 10 additional plants (five of each sex). All leaves on a single flowering
    branch were collected and scanned in the laboratory on a flatbed scanner and analysed
    using the public domain NIH Image program (http:// rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image/)
    to obtain a total leaf area for the branch. Leaves were oven-dried and weighed
    and the total leaf area on the branch was divided by the total dry mass of the
    leaves for that branch to obtain an estimate of SLA for each plant.

  methods: Leaf nitrogen and chlorophyll content were analysed for the 20 study plants
    at Tidbinbilla in 2000. Leaves of both sexes were collected during flowering.

    that leaf tissue was ground for analysis to obtain homogenous samples and individual

  methods: To assess the effect of differing currency, we calculated RA as a function
    of nitrogen content for Tidbinbilla plants in 2000 (RAN, grams of nitrogen in
    reproductive structures per gram of leaf tissue). Nitrogen content was determined
    by a semi-micro Kjeldahl technique (AOAC 1984). Tissue samples were digested at
    250 deg C for 15 min, then 460 deg C for 1 hour in a Tectator 2012 heating block
    with 6 mL sulphuric acid and a selenium catalyst. Cooled samples were then distilled
    and titrated with a Gerhardt Vapodest-5 apparatus. Flowers and fruits were small
    enough to be digested entire (some pollen was lost from male flowers during handling).
    Due to limited reproductive tissue being available for individual plant assays,
    flowers from several plants of each sex were pooled. The same procedure was used
    for fruits.

  methods: Leaf nitrogen and chlorophyll content were analysed for the 20 study plants
    at Tidbinbilla in 2000. For chlorophyll analysis, two sections of a young, healthy
    leaf from each of 20 plants were cut from either side of the mid-vein. These sections
    were scanned to obtain an area and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored
    at -80 deg C until used for chlorophyll extraction. Chlorophyll was extracted
    with buffered acetone and concentration was determined using a DU 640 Spectrophotometer
    (Beckman Instruments Inc., Fullerton, CA, USA) (Porra et al. 1989). Chlorophyll
    concentration was divided by the area of the sample discs to obtain an estimate
    of leaf chlorophyll content (chl a + chl b, umol m-2) for each plant.
