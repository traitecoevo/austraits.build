  description: An investigation of the contribution of multiple mechanical traits
    from shear, punch and tear tests to herbivore deterrence across feeding guilds.
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: Five plants per species were selected at the study sites in February
    (austral summer). On each plant, three leaves or phyllodes that expanded in the
    current growing season were tagged. Since we wished to measure damage to mature
    leaves, damage was first assessed on recently matured leaves, then re-assessed
    after 12 months. The percentage leaf area that was visibly damaged was estimated
    by eye when ~1 %, or by image analysis of digital photographs (Mix image analysis
    software, R. Stolk and G. Sanson, Monash University). Damage was assessed separately
    for external chewing and mining. Sucker feeding density was assessed by counting
    scales and scars from stylet penetration, examining both leaf surfaces, and expressed
    per singlesided leaf area. However, this estimate was only undertaken at the final
    assessment when leaves were removed from the plants, so it is uncertain at what
    stage of leaf development the feeding occurred. Where branchlets had died or disappeared
    by the second assessment, a leaf of the same cohort was chosen randomly. Damage
    may have been underestimated if whole leaves were removed by insect herbivores
    prior to branchlet death. Acceptability to larvae of the generalist chewer, the
    light brown apple moth (LBAM) (Epiphyas postvittana, Lepidoptera- Tortricidae)
    was assessed in a cafeteria trial in May-June. The larvae were grown in containers
    with a medium of yeast and vitamin supplements, supplied by the Department of
    Primary Industries, Victoria (Knoxfield). Half of the larvae were reared in a
    controlled environment cabinet at 15  deg C until reaching ~1 cm in length ('small
    larvae'), and the others were reared at 21 deg C to increase their growth rate
    until they reached a length of ~3 cm ('large larvae'). Leaves that developed in
    the previous growing season were collected from sunlit branches of tagged plants,
    ~0.5-2m above the ground, over a 2-week period in May-June. They were wrapped
    in moist paper and sealed in plastic bags. In the laboratory, samples of 1 cm2
    were cut from the leaves, or multiple cut leaves were used in small-leaved species.
    Leaf area was measured by image analysis before and after each trial to determine
    the area eaten. Feeding chambers were created by inverting plastic containers
    onto a piece of plain unbleached cotton cloth marked with a grid of 20 locations
    for leaf samples and intersection points for LBAM larvae. Moist paper was inserted
    to increase humidity. Leaf samples of each species were randomly positioned (using
    random numbers), and ten larvae were randomly positioned on the intersection points
    of the grid. Five replicate chambers were set up separately for small and large
    larvae, with each plant species used in each feeding trial. Feeding chambers were
    placed in a controlled environment cabinet at 21 deg C and larvae were allowed
    to feed for 24 h.

  methods: Specific leaf area and chemical analyses. The leaf area of one leaf per
    replicate plant was measured by image analysis, after weighing the fully hydrated
    leaf. The leaf was then dried at 105 deg C and reweighed. For compound leaves,
    leaf area and mass are for the complete leaf with the exception of Argyrodendron
    trifoliolatum, where measurements were probably made on a single leaflet.
