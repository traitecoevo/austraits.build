    description: The tropical Australian flora used consists of 229 species from
      Eucalyptus woodland in the Alligator Rivers region of Kakadu National Park (approx.
      12°30'S 132°30'E). This region has a dry monsoonal climate- most of the annual
      rainfall (which can vary from 840mm to 2800 mm) falls from December to March;
      however June to September is characterized by intense drought. The dataset was
      compiled by J.E. and supplemented with species lists from Taylor & Dunlop (1985).

traits:
- var_in: growth form 1=tree, 2=shrub, 3=subshrub, 4=forb, 5=graminoid, 10=vine
  unit_in: .na
  trait_name: plant_growth_form
  value_type: expert_mean
  replicates: .na
  methods: 'Species were assigned to one of four growth form categories: herbs, graminoids,
    woody species (i.e. shrub and trees combined), and climbers.'
- var_in: 'dispersal mode: 1=unassisted, 2=ant, 3=vertebrate, 4=adhesion, 5=wind'
  unit_in: .na
  trait_name: dispersal_syndrome
  value_type: expert_mean
  replicates: .na
  methods: For all floras, dispersal modes were inferred from external morphological
    features of the diaspore. All species were assigned to one of five dispersal categories -
    unassisted, vertebrate, wind, ant and adhesion. As assignment to dispersal category
    relied on morphological features of the diaspore, following the methods of Leishman
    & Westoby (1994), very small diaspores that might, in effect, be wind-  dispersed,
    and seeds dispersed ballistically by structures associated with the parent plant
    were conservatively assigned to the 'unassisted' category.
- var_in: seed mass (mg)
  unit_in: mg
  trait_name: seed_mass
  value_type: multisite_mean
  replicates: 20
  methods: Seed mass was measured to an accuracy of 0.1mg on a Mettler balance, for
    at least twenty ripe oven-diaspores per species. The five or ten diaspores closest
    to the mean were then dissected and separate weights were obtained for seed (embryo+endosperm+testa)
    versus dispersal structure. Where fresh material was unavailable herbarium material
    was used.

questions:
  austraits: Only one of the floras analysed for the study are included
    in the data. I'm assuming that is because the other data is in Austraits under
    the original authors names?
