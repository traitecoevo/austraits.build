dataset:
  year_collected_start: 1995
  year_collected_end: 1995
  description: seed and growth form data for 229 species from Eucalyptus woodland
    in Northern Territory
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: Data collection for one flora as well as synthesis of data from
    other published sources.
  original_file: nteucpr.xls
  notes: .na
  questions for austraits: Only one of the floras analysed for the study are included
    in the data. I'm assuming that is because the other data is in Austraits under
    the original authors names?

  Alligator River Kakadu:
    longitude: 132.5
    latitude: -12.5
    description: 'The tropical Australian flora used consists of 229 species from
      Eucalyptus woodland in the Alligator Rivers region of Kakadu National Park (approx.
      12°30’S 132°30’E). This region has a dry monsoonal climate: most of the annual
      rainfall (which can vary from 840mm to 2800 mm) falls from December to March;
      however June to September is characterized by intense drought. The dataset was
      compiled by J.E. and supplemented with species lists from Taylor & Dunlop (1985).'

  trait_name: dispersal_syndrome
  value_type: expert opinion
  replicates: unknown
  methods: 'For all floras, dispersal modes were inferred from external morphological
    features of the diaspore. All species were assigned to one of five dispersal categories:
    unassisted, vertebrate, wind, ant and adhesion. As assignment to dispersal category
    relied on morphological features of the diaspore, following the methods of Leishman
    & Westoby (1994), very small diaspores that might, in effect, be wind-  dispersed,
    and seeds dispersed ballistically by structures associated with the parent plant
    were conservatively assigned to the ‘unassisted’ category. '
- var_in: seed mass (mg)
  unit_in: mg
  trait_name: seed_mass
  value_type: mean
  replicates: 20
  methods: Seed mass was measured to an accuracy of 0.1mg on a Mettler balance, for
    at least twenty ripe oven-diaspores per species. The five or ten diaspores closest
    to the mean were then dissected and separate weights were obtained for seed (embryo+endosperm+testa)
    versus dispersal structure. Where fresh material was unavailable herbarium material
    was used.
