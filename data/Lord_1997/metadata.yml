    description: The tropical Australian flora used consists of 229 species from Eucalyptus
      woodland in the Alligator Rivers region of Kakadu National Park (approx. 12
      deg 30'S 132 deg 30'E). This region has a dry monsoonal climate- most of the
      annual rainfall (which can vary from 840mm to 2800 mm) falls from December to
      March; however June to September is characterized by intense drought. The dataset
      was compiled by J.E. and supplemented with species lists from Taylor & Dunlop
      (1985).
contexts: .na
traits:
- var_in: growth form 1=tree, 2=shrub, 3=subshrub, 4=forb, 5=graminoid, 10=vine
  unit_in: .na
  trait_name: plant_growth_form
  entity_type: species
  value_type: mode
  basis_of_value: expert_score
  replicates: .na
  methods: 'Species were assigned to one of four growth form categories: herbs, graminoids,
    woody species (i.e. shrub and trees combined), and climbers.'
- var_in: 'dispersal mode: 1=unassisted, 2=ant, 3=vertebrate, 4=adhesion, 5=wind'
  unit_in: .na
  trait_name: dispersal_syndrome
  entity_type: species
  value_type: mode
  basis_of_value: expert_score
  replicates: .na
  methods: For all floras, dispersal modes were inferred from external morphological
    features of the diaspore. All species were assigned to one of five dispersal categories
    - unassisted, vertebrate, wind, ant and adhesion. As assignment to dispersal category
    relied on morphological features of the diaspore, following the methods of Leishman
    & Westoby (1994), very small diaspores that might, in effect, be wind-  dispersed,
    and seeds dispersed ballistically by structures associated with the parent plant
    were conservatively assigned to the 'unassisted' category.

  unit_in: mg
  trait_name: seed_dry_mass
  entity_type: metapopulation
  value_type: mean
  basis_of_value: measurement
  replicates: 20
  methods: Seed mass was measured to an accuracy of 0.1mg on a Mettler balance, for
    at least twenty ripe oven-diaspores per species. The five or ten diaspores closest
    to the mean were then dissected and separate weights were obtained for seed (embryo+endosperm+testa)
    versus dispersal structure. Where fresh material was unavailable herbarium material
    was used.
