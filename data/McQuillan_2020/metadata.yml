  description: Study to explore how the P concentration in leaves of common Australian
    native plant species varies across a broad geographic region that includes naturally
    low to naturally high P status soils; and (ii) investigate whether there is a
    connection between P speciation and P concentration in these leaves.

  sampling_strategy: Description of field sites ^p Soil and plant samples were collected
    along an approximately 425 km transect along the western edge of the Great Dividing
    Range in northern NSW (Fig. 1). All samples were collected over a two week period
    in May 2018. This sampling was conducted in collaboration with the Terrestrial
    Ecosystem Research Network (TERN) and coincided with the establishment of six
    TERN 'Ausplot Rangeland Survey' sites in northern NSW. A range of forest ecosystems
    was sampled from dense tall Eucalyptus forest, through Cypress pine tall open
    forest, to Snow Gum grassy open forest. These sites reflect differences in geology,
    climate and rainfall. Site elevation ranges from 200 to 1430 m; mean annual temperature
    (MAT) ranges from 12 to 19 °C; mean annual precipitation (MAP) ranges from 560
    to 1200 mm per year. ^p Soil and plant sampling ^p There were two categories of
    sampling sites. The six TERN sites, all of which were within protected lands (e.g.
    National Parks) were sampled using the AusPlots Rangelands Survey Protocol (White
    et al. 2012). In brief, this involves establishing 100 m x 100 m plots that are
    used to evaluate vegetation characteristics and to collect plant and soil samples
    consistently across the country. In addition to these six TERN sites, 15 roadside
    sites were chosen that were located between TERN sites. At each of the 21 sampling
    locations, the targeted species (see below) were identified and approximately
    10-15 g of fresh leaf material was collected from the outermost layer of the canopy
    at the highest reachable point (i.e. up to ~2 m above the ground). Where multiple
    individuals of the same species were sampled within the same site, samples were
    kept separate and analysed separately. At each site, a 0-10 cm soil sample was
    collected within 10 m of one of the sampled plants. ^p Eight potentially co-occurring
    plant species - spanning four genera, four families and two phyla - were sampled,
    Acacia decora, Callitris glaucophylla, Einadia nutans, and five locally common
    Eucalyptus species, E. blakelyi, E. camaldulensis, E. microcarpa, E. pauciflora
    and E. sideroxylon. All plant specimens were identified by herbaria by means of
    voucher specimens that were collected at both TERN and roadside sites. ^p During
    collection, care was taken to prevent moisture from affecting the collected material
    while in the field by placing samples in paper bags to air dry and storing them
    within a rain-proof container that was left open to the atmosphere to air-dry
    the leaf material as much as possible. Upon returning to the University of Adelaide,
    plant samples were transferred to a plant press and left to air dry for 3.5 months,
    while soil samples were oven-dried at 40 °C for 48 h. ^p After oven-drying, soil
    samples were ground and sieved to <2 mm. Plant material was subsampled from the
    plant press and oven-dried for 1 h at 60 °C before leaves were separated from
    twigs and branches and ground with a puck mill to a fine powder suitable for extraction
    and subsequent chemical analysis.

    mixture. For soils, samples (0.25 g) were cold-digested overnight in 4 mL of aqua
    regia (3:1 mixture of 37% hydrochloric acid and 70% nitric acid). The following
    day, the acid digests were heated to 125 °C for 3.5 h. The digests were allowed
    to cool, diluted to 20 mL through the addition of Milli-Q water, filtered with
    Whatman Grade 42, ashless filter paper and analysed by ICP-OES (Perkin Elmer Avio
    200).
