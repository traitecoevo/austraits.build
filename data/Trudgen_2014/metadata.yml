  methods: Measurements were taken from well pressed, herbarium specimens, taking

    Multiple images of seeds were taken with a Nikon Digital Head (DS-5M) controlled
    by a DS Camera Control Unit (DS-L1) and a montage of the images was collated using
    the Synopics Auto-Montage Pro Version 5.03.0061 software.

  contributor: Are the plant height measurements, plant growth form classifications,
    and flowering time data from herbarium specimems or your own field observations?
