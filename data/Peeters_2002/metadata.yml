  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: Eighteen shrub species were selected to represent a variety of
    leaf types and to maximize contrasts within families and genera (Table 1). All
    plant species were evergreen, although they varied in the timing and duration
    of new leaf production (Peeters et al., 2001).

    description: tall open eucalypt forest (sensu Specht, 1970), at an altitude of
      120–220 m. The site experiences a temperate climate (mean winter minimum 2.6°C,
      mean summer maximum 24.8°C) with a median annual rainfall of 1000 mm (see Peeters
      et al ., 2001 for further details). The forest contains many understorey shrub
      and small tree species representing a range of plant traits.

  trait_name: leaf_area
  value_type: mean
  replicates: 5
  methods: The image analysis software BioScan 3.1 (Monash University) was used to
    determine leaf area of fresh leaves (N = 5) of each plant species and leaf age.
    Leaves were oven dried at 40degC to constant weight and dry weight was determined
    for five leaves of each age, for each species except Pultenaea weindorferi and
    P. muelleri . The leaves of P. weindorferi and P. muelleri were weighed in groups
    as they were too small to be weighed individually.
