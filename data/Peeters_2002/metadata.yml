  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: Eighteen shrub species were selected to represent a variety of
    leaf types and to maximize contrasts within families and genera (Table 1). All
    plant species were evergreen, although they varied in the timing and duration
    of new leaf production (Peeters et al., 2001).

    description: tall open eucalypt forest (sensu Specht, 1970), at an altitude of
      120-220 m. The site experiences a temperate climate (mean winter minimum 2.6C,
      mean summer maximum 24.8C) with a median annual rainfall of 1000 mm (see Peeters
      et al ., 2001 for further details). The forest contains many understorey shrub
      and small tree species representing a range of plant traits.

  replicates: '5'
  methods: The image analysis software BioScan 3.1 (Monash University) was used to
    determine leaf area of fresh leaves (N = 5) of each plant species and leaf age.
    Leaves were oven dried at 40degC to constant weight and dry weight was determined
    for five leaves of each age, for each species except Pultenaea weindorferi and
    P. muelleri . The leaves of P. weindorferi and P. muelleri were weighed in groups
    as they were too small to be weighed individually.

  methods: Stomate density and length was also measured as suckers have been known to use stomates as entry points into the leaf. Fresh leaves for sectioning were fixed in 5% glutareldehyde in 0.03 M Pipe's buffer (pH 6.8–7.0) and stored at 4 C. Leaf material was serially dehydrated in ethanol and polymerized in LR White resin. A Leica Ultracut microtome was used to cut 2 um sections which were mounted on glass slides and stained with Toluidine Blue (pH 4.4) for 30 s. Coverslips were affixed with Histamount. Anatomical measurements were made from prepared leaf sections (N = 3 leaves) using a light microscope linked to a video camera and monitor. Cell walls staining light blue were assumed to be lignified. Both upper (adaxial) and lower (abaxial) leaf surfaces were surveyed for stomates and hairs. Cuticles were prepared for stomate measurement by clearing leaves in 10% aqueous chromic acid. Cuticle envelopes were then neutralized with 10% aqueous ammonia, stained with Safranin O and mounted on glass slides with coverslips using Histamount. Stomate size and density was measured with a light microscope (N = 3 leaves). Fresh leaf hair density and height was measured using a dissecting microscope (N = 3 leaves).
