  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: Eighteen shrub species were selected to represent a variety of
    leaf types and to maximize contrasts within families and genera (Table 1). All
    plant species were evergreen, although they varied in the timing and duration
    of new leaf production (Peeters et al., 2001).

    description: tall open eucalypt forest (sensu Specht, 1970), at an altitude of
      120-220 m. The site experiences a temperate climate (mean winter minimum 2.6C,
      mean summer maximum 24.8C) with a median annual rainfall of 1000 mm (see Peeters
      et al ., 2001 for further details). The forest contains many understorey shrub
      and small tree species representing a range of plant traits.

- var_in: leaf area cm2
  unit_in: cm2
  trait_name: leaf_area
  value_type: site_mean
  replicates: '5'
  methods: The image analysis software BioScan 3.1 (Monash University) was used to
    determine leaf area of fresh leaves (N = 5) of each plant species and leaf age.
    Leaves were oven dried at 40degC to constant weight and dry weight was determined
    for five leaves of each age, for each species except Pultenaea weindorferi and
    P. muelleri . The leaves of P. weindorferi and P. muelleri were weighed in groups
    as they were too small to be weighed individually.

  trait_name: leaf_thickness
  value_type: site_mean
  replicates: 3
  methods: Stomate density and length was also measured as suckers have been known
    to use stomates as entry points into the leaf. Fresh leaves for sectioning were
    fixed in 5% glutareldehyde in 0.03 M Pipe's buffer (pH 6.8-7.0) and stored at
    4 C. Leaf material was serially dehydrated in ethanol and polymerized in LR White
    resin. A Leica Ultracut microtome was used to cut 2 um sections which were mounted
    on glass slides and stained with Toluidine Blue (pH 4.4) for 30 s. Coverslips
    were affixed with Histamount. Anatomical measurements were made from prepared
    leaf sections (N = 3 leaves) using a light microscope linked to a video camera
    and monitor. Cell walls staining light blue were assumed to be lignified. Both
    upper (adaxial) and lower (abaxial) leaf surfaces were surveyed for stomates and
    hairs. Cuticles were prepared for stomate measurement by clearing leaves in 10%
    aqueous chromic acid. Cuticle envelopes were then neutralized with 10% aqueous
    ammonia, stained with Safranin O and mounted on glass slides with coverslips using
    Histamount. Stomate size and density was measured with a light microscope (N =
    3 leaves). Fresh leaf hair density and height was measured using a dissecting
    microscope (N = 3 leaves).

- var_in: water content (%)

  trait_name: leaf_water_content_per_saturated_mass
  value_type: site_mean
  replicates: 5
  methods: Fresh water content (which approximated turgid water content because of
    the wet conditions when collected) was determined for five leaves of each age,
    for each species except Pultenaea muelleri and P. weindorferi. The leaves of P.
    muelleri and P. weindorferi were weighed in groups because they were too small
    to be weighed individually. Water content was not determined for new leaves of
    Banksia marginata because of lost samples. Leaves were oven dried at 40 deg C
    to constant weight and material for fibre and nitrogen analysis was ground through
    a 1-mm2 mesh.
