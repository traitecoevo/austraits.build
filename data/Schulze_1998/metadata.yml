  description: Carbon isotope discrimination and nitrogen isotope ratios, N-concentrations
    and specific leaf area of 50 tree species were investigated along a continental-scale
    transect through northern Australia over which annual rainfall varied from 1800
    mm to 216 mm rainfall
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: The North Australian Tropical Transect (NATT) is one of the continental
    transects of the IGBP core project GCTE (Walker and Steffen 1997). It is approximately
    900 km long, and reaches from Darwin (about 12 deg S) in the mesic north of the
    Northern Territory to the edge of the Tanamai Desert (near Kalkaringi, about 17
    deg S). The NATT thus encompasses the majority of the Northern Territory landscapes
    where the occurence of the summer rains is predictable, in that a wet season occurs
    each year. However, in order to encompass a larger range of rainfall the present
    study extended this transect to Melville Island in the north (about 11 deg S)
    offshore from Darwin, to Giles and the Olgas in the center of the continent (about
    26 deg S, Fig. 1). Sun exposed leaves were collected at the end of the dry season
    in October 1993 at 20 locations (Table 1). At each site the main species dominating
    the tree canopy were sampled. The number of species sampled per site varied from
    1 to 14. Between 3 and 5 individual trees were sampled per species in an area
    of about 1 hectare. Tree height and diameter at breast height were recorded for
    each sample tree. The sampling strategy was designed a priori to allow the collection
    of Eucalyptus species which were widespread in their distribution, and which showed
    overlap in their distribution with other, potentially co-ocurring species.
