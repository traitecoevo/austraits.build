    and specific leaf area of 50 tree species were investigated along a continental-scale
    transect through northern Australia over which annual rainfall varied from 1800
    mm to 216 mm rainfall

  sampling_strategy: The North Australian Tropical Transect (NATT) is one of the continental
    transects of the IGBP core project GCTE (Walker and Steffen 1997). It is approximately
    900 km long, and reaches from Darwin (about 12°S) in the mesic north of the Northern
    Territory to the edge of the Tanamai Desert (near Kalkaringi, about 17°S). The
    NATT thus encompasses the majority of the Northern Territory landscapes where
    the occurence of the summer rains is predictable, in that a wet season occurs
    each year. However, in order to encompass a larger range of rainfall the present
    study extended this transect to Melville Island in the north (about 11°S) offshore
    from Darwin, to Giles and the Olgas in the center of the continent (about 26°S,
    Fig. 1). Sun exposed leaves were collected at the end of the dry season in October
    1993 at 20 locations (Table 1). At each site the main species dominating the tree
    canopy were sampled. The number of species sampled per site varied from 1 to 14.
    Between 3 and 5 individual trees were sampled per species in an area of about
    1 hectare. Tree height and diameter at breast height were recorded for each sample
    tree. The sampling strategy was designed á priori to allow the collection of Eucalyptus
    species which were widespread in their distribution, and which showed overlap
    in their distribution with other, potentially co-ocurring species.

questions:
  qu: The NATTdata.xis data file does not contain the traits 'leaf_N_per_area' and 'plant_growth_form' previously included in the incomplete dataset "Schulze_0000". Are these traits also available for the expanded dataset?
  random: Currently I have Willi Brand, Waltraud Schulze, Inge Schulze and Ernst-Detlef Schulze listed as co-authors for the AusTraits data paper. Have the appropriate contributors been included? 
  another: Coordinates are missing for the following sites- Kapalga K, Kapalga M, Kapalga P,  Kapalga S and Kidman Springs 3. Do you have these coordinates available? 
  again: Is the site description for Kapalga K, Kapalga M and Kapalga P also 'Tall forest with grass understory' like Kapalga C? Furthermore, is the site description for Kapalga S also 'Open forest with grass understory' like Kapalga Q? Currently the only description I have for most of these sites is if they are burnt/ unburnt.
