  description: seed for 519 Australian species from H. Trevor Clifford
  collection_type: field, laboratory
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: Seeds of 1679 indigenous Australian dicotyledon species and 65
    dicotyledon weed species were germinated in petri dishes on filter paper resting
    on a moisture reservoir of damp soil or sand. Dishes were placed near the window
    in the office of H.T.C. If germination did not occur, various treatments were
    applied such as increased temperature, vernalisation in a standard refrigerator,
    fluctuating temperature, and scarification and leaching of seeds or fruits in
    running water.

- var_in: seed_volume_mm3
  unit_in: mm3
  trait_name: seed_volume
  value_type: unknown
  replicates: unknown
  methods: Seeds were assumed to be ellipsoids and the volumes calculated for 302
    species from measurements of seed length (l), breadth (b) and width (w) (volume
    = pi / 6.1 .b.w). Seed volume ranged from 0.001 mm3 (Drosera bunnaniz) to 93,530
    mm3 (Aleurites molucanna) and was log transformed prior to analyses since the
    distribution was log normal.

  methods: 'Fruit type was recorded for all species for which we had seed volume and/or
    embryo data (total 488 species). Nine categories were recorded: achene (10 species),
    berry (79), capsule (158), cypsela (18, all Asteraceae), drupe (121; 88 of which
    from Lauraceae), legume (69, all Fabales), nut (16), schizocarp (9), and utricle
    (8, all Caryophyllales). Data on presence/absence of endosperm (Clifford & Ludlow,
    1978) and average seed oil content (Earle & Jones, 1962; Jones & Earle, 1966;
    Barclay & Earle, 1974; Levin, 1974) were collated in order to explore relationships
    suggested by the results and/or relevant literature.'

    germination mode (1738 spp) phanerocotylar 1, cryptocotylar 2; first leaf (940

    of first node type, coding was such that 1 was the more common state at species
