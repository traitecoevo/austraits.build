  description: seed for 519 Australian species from H. Trevor Clifford
  basis_of_record: field, lab
  life_stage: adult, seedling
  sampling_strategy: Seeds of 1679 indigenous Australian dicotyledon species and 65
    dicotyledon weed species were germinated in petri dishes on filter paper resting
    on a moisture reservoir of damp soil or sand. Dishes were placed near the window
    in the office of H.T.C. If germination did not occur, various treatments were
    applied such as increased temperature, vernalisation in a standard refrigerator,
    fluctuating temperature, and scarification and leaching of seeds or fruits in
    running water.

- var_in: seed_volume_mm3
  unit_in: mm3
  trait_name: seed_volume
  entity_type: species
  value_type: mean
  basis_of_value: measurement
  replicates: unknown
  methods: Seeds were assumed to be ellipsoids and the volumes calculated for 302
    species from measurements of seed length (l), breadth (b) and width (w) (volume
    = pi / 6*length*breadth*width). Seed volume ranged from 0.001 mm3 (Drosera bunnaniz)
    to 93,530 mm3 (Aleurites molucanna) and was log transformed prior to analyses
    since the distribution was log normal.

    Barclay & Earle, 1974; Levin, 1974) were collated in order to explore relationships
