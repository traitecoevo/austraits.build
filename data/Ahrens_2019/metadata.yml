  description: Dataset investigating trait variation in a single species (Corymbia
    calophylla) using seed sourced from natural populations growing across a climatic
    gradient.

  sampling_strategy: '2.1 Study species: Corymbia calophylla is a foundation forest
    canopy species located in Western Australia (WA). It is considered a foundation
    species be-cause its characteristics are critical for forest structure and ecologi-cal
    processes (Ellison et al., 2005). This species is an ideal candidate in which
    to study adaptation of functional traits because its distribu-tion traverses strong
    environmental gradients over short distances, it has recently experienced mortality
    events attributed to climate change (Matusick, Ruthrof, Brouwers, Dell, & Hardy,
    2013; Ruthrof, Matusick, & Hardy, 2015), and evidence of adaptation to climate
    has been identified in physiological experiments and genome-environment investigations
    (Ahrens, Byrne, & Rymer, 2019; Ahrens, Mazanec, et al., 2019; Aspinwall et al.,
    2017; Blackman, Aspinwall, Tissue, & Rymer, 2017). ^p 2.2 Experimental site and
    population sampling: This research was conducted in a plantation near Margaret
    River, WA (Figure 1), located in the cool-wet region of the distribution of C.
    calophylla. Seed collection and trial design are described in detail in Ahrens,
    Mazanec, et al. (2019). Briefly, 18 populations represented by 165 families were
    established at the experimental site for a total of 3,960 individuals in six replicated
    blocks. Families are defined here as individuals that have a known, common mother
    but an unknown father (i.e., half-sibs). We developed two separate data sets:
    the first was used to estimate trait heritability, while the sec-ond was used
    to explore correlation and coordination among traits and its association with
    climate-of-origin. For the first data set, we focused on four populations representing
    four contrasting climate combinations covering the full geographic distribution
    of C. calophylla (BOO, cool-wet climate; CRI, cool-dry climate; HRI, hot-dry climate;
    SER, hot-wet climate; Figure 1). A total of 40 families (when available) from
    the four populations were sampled, with 12 replicate trees from each family, to
    provide estimates of phenotypic variance within and among families (480 trees).
    For the second data set, we collected data from 12 populations with four replicates
    from each of 10 families (when available) to estimate variance within and among
    populations (480 trees; Table 1; Figure 1).'

  notes: Site names indicate seed source. All plants were grown in a single plantation.
    Within each seed source are different genetic families, indicated in the data.csv
    file; quite a few duplicate values with Schulze_2006_2, but these are truly independent
    values, for both studies made many measurements on the same species.

  methods: Traits were measured in March 2017 on Corymbia calophylla trees that were
    29 months old and 2-3 m tall. For each individual tree, we removed a north facing,
    mid-canopy side branch at its intersection with the main stem. The side branch
    was removed in the morning (between 8 a.m. and 12 noon), stored in a cool box,
    and measured in the afternoon (between 12 noon and 6 p.m.). Traits were measured
    on each side branch. Photochemical reflectance index (PRI) is a spectral physiological
    index that is an indicator of vegetation stress based on its sensitivity to radiance-use
    efficiency (RUE) and the xanthophyll cycle (Gamon, Serrano, & Surfus, 1997; Garbulsky,
    Penuelas, Gamon, Inoue, & Filella, 2011).

    the branch was removed, excluding areas that included knots, the bark was removed,
    and the volume measured using the water displacement method. The piece of wood
    was then dried in a 70 deg C oven for 7 days before measuring for dry weight.
    Final wood density was calculated by dividing the dry weight by the volume (g/cm3).
