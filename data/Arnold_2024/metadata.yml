  description: A study that quantified the plasticity and evolutionary potential of
    an alpine herb Wahlenbergia ceracea.
  basis_of_record: lab
  life_stage: seedling
  sampling_strategy: Species description, seed source, and F0-F2 generations ^p Wahlenbergia
    ceracea Lothian (Campanulaceae) waxy bluebell is a short-lived, protandrous, and
    facultatively autogamous biennial herb that is sparsely distributed across south-eastern
    Australia and Tasmania (Nicotra et al., 2015). For this study, seeds were collected
    between 1590 m and 2100 m a.s.l. from Kosciuszko National Park, NSW, Australia
    (36.43°S, 148.33°E) in 2015 and 2016 (see Notarnicola et al., 2021 for further
    details), and brought to The Australian National University, Canberra, ACT, Australia.
    These seeds formed the F0 generation, we describe below their rearing and subsequent
    breeding design for F1, F2, and F3 generations, with the F3 plants then being
    used for the analyses here of phenotypic plasticity, transgenerational plasticity,
    heritable genetic variance, and inbreeding depression. ^p F0, F1, and F2 generations
    ^p Detailed descriptions of the conditions and breeding design for producing plants
    for generations F0-F3 in this study have been given previously (Notarnicola et
    al., 2021; Wang et al., 2021; Arnold et al., 2022). Briefly, F0 plants grown from
    field-collected seeds were raised in glasshouses that mimicked average alpine
    summer temperatures (25/15 °C during germination and growth, which was reduced
    to 20/15 °C at peak flowering). F1 plants were produced by crossing 48 F0 plants
    as pollen donors with 48 F0 plants as ovule donors (96 plants from 63 unique F0
    families) to produce 48 F1 families by hand pollination. F1 plants were raised
    under the same conditions as the F0 plants (Supplementary Fig. S1). The F2 generation
    was produced using a partial diallel (maximizing the number of parents used to
    generate families) half-sib breeding design in which 12 F1 plants were used as
    pollen donors and each outcrossed with at least four unrelated pollen receivers
    (48 pollen receivers in total). F2 plants were grown in glasshouses under two
    temperature regimes ('cool' 20/15 °C day/night conditions and 'warm' 30/25 °C
    day/night conditions) that hereafter constitute the 'parental temperature'. These
    two temperature regimes represent the cool conditions to which these alpine plants
    are already well adapted, and the warm conditions simulate substantial warming
    that could occur under an extreme climate change scenario. ^p F3 breeding design
    and pedigree ^p Within each parental temperature treatment, 12 F2 lines were assigned
    as pollen donors and these were each outcrossed with four unrelated pollen receivers,
    such that cool and warm F2 lines were full-sibs of the same F1 parentage. Each
    of the F2 parent plants in each treatment were also self-pollinated to generate
    12 F3 inbred maternal and 11 inbred paternal lines, in addition to the 12 outcrossed
    F3 lines that were reciprocally outcrossed from paired F2 pollen donors from each
    parental temperature treatment (Supplementary Fig. S1). In total, there were 96
    outcrossed F3 families and 46 inbred F3 families, all controlled by hand pollination
    and bagging flowers. The capsules that were formed after hand pollination of the
    F2 plants were removed after they had opened, dried, and the seeds had browned.
    All seeds taken from these capsules were stored in a desiccator for at least 7
    weeks at ~20 °C and 15-20% relative humidity before the beginning of the experiment.
    ^p F3 growth experiment and temperature treatments ^p For each F3 cross, 20-30
    seeds from a single capsule were sown across two 50 mm Petri dishes containing
    1% agar, each corresponding to a growth temperature treatment. The dishes were
    sealed and moved to an incubator for cold stratification at 5 °C in darkness for
    6 weeks to release seeds from dormancy, thereby improving subsequent germination
    success (Wang et al., 2021). At least eight healthy seedlings per dish were transplanted
    into punnets containing seed raising mix (Debco Pty Ltd, VIC, Australia) and moved
    into ideal common glasshouse conditions (25/18 °C) to grow for 3 months. The 25/18
    °C temperature regime was chosen based on the daytime temperature that increased
    growth rates of W. ceracea seedlings (Arnold et al., 2022), while maintaining
    natural cooling at night. Liquid fertilizer (Thrive soluble all purpose plant
    food; Yates, NSW, Australia) at a concentration of 0.5 g l-1 was added regularly
    to promote growth, and seedlings were watered twice daily. Up to eight healthy
    seedlings (6-40 mm in diameter) from each family were transplanted into individual
    plastic pots (125 mm diameter, ~600 ml) filled with soil suitable for Australian
    natives combined with 3 g l-1 of low phosphorus slow-release fertilizer (Scotts
    Osmocote Plus Trace Elements, Native Gardens; Evergreen Garden Care Australia,
    NSW, Australia). ^p The potted F3 plants were moved to their growth temperature
    treatment 7 d after transplantation (commenced 7 November 2019). For the cool
    treatment, plants were placed in a large glasshouse room set to 20/15 °C (day/night)
    under natural photoperiod, and for the warm treatment, plants were placed in an
    adjacent glasshouse room set to 30/20 °C (day/night). An automatic shade screen
    was active between 12.00 h and 14.30 h and when external temperatures exceeded
    30 °C for the cool treatment and 33 °C for the warm treatment, to prevent excess
    solar radiation and overheating of the glasshouses; otherwise plants received
    natural light. Plants were watered daily initially until growing well and then
    watered to weight to ensure that the soil did not dry out and water was not limiting.
    As such, the plants in the warm treatment received more frequent watering than
    did those in the cool treatment. Pest treatments (VectoBac larvicide for treating
    fungus gnats, and sulfur evaporation for treating powdery mildew) were conducted
    as required, and liquid fertilizer 1 g l-1 was applied approximately fortnightly
    as required for maintaining healthy growth. Within each treatment, we randomized
    the distribution of one plant from each family to each of four blocks consisting
    of 29 columns and five rows, which was replicated across both rooms. Not all families
    had eight healthy plants, but each had at least five plants that were distributed
    randomly across both treatments. Empty pots were used in place of a missing plant,
    so that the position layout was preserved across all blocks. In total, there were
    1024 plants (out of an ideal 1152) at the beginning of the growth experiment (512
    in each growth treatment).

  methods: After 4 weeks in the treatments (9 January 2020), we began phenotyping leaves for thermal tolerance limits. We measured the heat and cold tolerance limits of leaves by measuring the temperature-dependent change in minimal chlorophyll fluorescence (T-F0) using controllable thermoelectric Peltier plates (plate, CP-121HT; controller, TC-36-25; TE-Technology, Inc., MI, USA) in conjunction with imaging fluorimeters. We determined the critical threshold temperatures at which F0 increased rapidly to indicate the impairment of PSII, as measures of physiological heat tolerance (Tcrit-hot) and cold tolerance (Tcrit-cold).
