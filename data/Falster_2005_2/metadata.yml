      description: The study was conducted in low‐open sclerophyll forest situated in Myall Lakes National Park in southeastern Australia (32°41′S 152°09′E, elev. 50 m). Annual precipitation is moderate (1352 mm, 105 year average, Sugarloaf point), with some rain in all months. Mean annual temperature is 17°C. The park contains a diversity of vegetation structural types delimited by substrate variation arising from past and present dune formation (Myerscough et al. 1995). We restricted our study to a large section of the park (∼8000 ha) situated on a relatively homogenous substrate of freely draining Holocene sands (Myerscough and Carolin 1986). 
      Vegetation in the study area is characterised by an open tree‐layer to 35 m consisting of Eucalyptus pilularis, E. gummifera and Angophora costata. These species are rarely killed by fire and readily resprout from epicormic buds (Fox and Fox 1986). A diverse understorey is dominated by shrubs from the families Fabaceae, Mimosaceae, Epacridaceae and Proteaceae. Most aboveground biomass among understorey species is killed by fire, with regrowth from either seed or below ground reserves. Approximately half of all species retain some capacity to resprout after fire (Fox 1988). 
  sampling_strategy: Fire is a recurrent disturbance in the park (interval – 0–30 years; Fox and Fox 1986). A mosaic of fire histories has facilitated previous use of space‐for‐time substitutions in studies of small mammal succession (Fox and McKay 1981). Here we employ the same methodology to reconstruct species height‐growth trajectories (Enright and Goldblum 1999). Sites were identified at a range of times since fire with the use of NSW national parks GIS fire history records and personal observations of Karen Ross (Ross et al. 2002). Patches of vegetation 1, 2, 4, 8, 10, 12, 15, 27 and 28 years since fire were identified. Where possible several patches within a given age class were surveyed to determine species presence or absence. Nineteen species recorded in a majority of patches were selected for further study. This included eight resprouting species and 11 obligate seeders (full list in Appendix 1).

  trait_name: specific_leaf_area
  value_type: unknown

  methodology_ids: LMA was calculated as the leaf dry mass (oven‐dried for 48 h at 65°C) divided by leaf area. It was determined for the first five fully expanded leaves (including petioles) at the tip of each individual. 
- var_in: Nmass (%)

  trait_name: leaf_N_per_dry_mass
  value_type: unknown
  replicates: unknown
  precision: unknown
  methodology_ids: To determine leaf N per day mass, leaves from all individuals per species were  pooled and finely ground for nitrogen analysis. Total nitrogen concentration (%) was measured using complete combustion gas chromatography by Waite Analytical Services, Adelaide. It was determined for the first five fully expanded leaves (including petioles) at the tip of each individual. 
- var_in: leaf size (mm2)
  unit_in: mm2
  trait_name: leaf_area
  value_type: unknown

  precision: unknown
  methodology_ids: Leaf area was calculated as the one sided leaf area (flat bed scanner). It was determined for the first five fully expanded leaves (including petioles) at the tip of each individual. 
- var_in: Stem tissue density (mg mm-3)
  unit_in: mg/mm3
  trait_name: wood_density
  value_type: unknown
  replicates: unknown
  precision: unknown
  methodology_ids: Stem tissue density (dry mass fresh volume−1; mg mm−3) was calculated using 40–60 mm stem segments taken 250 mm back along a branch from the tip. Fresh samples were refrigerated before processing. After removing bark material, the volume of each sample was determined using Archimedes’ principle (Hacke et al. 2000). Samples were submerged in a water‐filled container on a balance. The weight change (mg) recorded during submersion corresponds to the mass of water displaced, which can be converted to a volume (mm3) using the formula, displacement weight (mg)/0.998 (mg mm−3), where 0.998 mg mm−3 is the density of water at 20°C. Samples were then dried for 4 days at 60°C before weighing.

  methodology_ids: Mean oven dried seed mass was estimated for as many species as possible using field material supplemented with additional data from a global seed mass database, compiled and maintained by Angela Moles (Moles and Westoby 2003).
