  description: Trait values for species with faster versus slower height growth following
    disturbance for Myall Lakes species.
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: Fire is a recurrent disturbance in the park (interval – 0–30
    years; Fox and Fox 1986). A mosaic of fire histories has facilitated previous
    use of space-for-time substitutions in studies of small mammal succession (Fox
    and McKay 1981). Here we employ the same methodology to reconstruct species height-growth
    trajectories (Enright and Goldblum 1999). Sites were identified at a range of
    times since fire with the use of NSW national parks GIS fire history records and
    personal observations of Karen Ross (Ross et al. 2002). Patches of vegetation
    1, 2, 4, 8, 10, 12, 15, 27 and 28 years since fire were identified. Where possible
    several patches within a given age class were surveyed to determine species presence
    or absence. Nineteen species recorded in a majority of patches were selected for
    further study. This included eight resprouting species and 11 obligate seeders
    (full list in Appendix 1).

    description: The study was conducted in low-open sclerophyll forest situated in
      Myall Lakes National Park in southeastern Australia. Annual precipitation is moderate (1352 mm, 105 year average, Sugarloaf
      point), with some rain in all months. Mean annual temperature is 17°C. The park
      contains a diversity of vegetation structural types delimited by substrate variation
      arising from past and present dune formation (Myerscough et al. 1995). We restricted
      our study to a large section of the park (~8000 ha) situated on a relatively
      homogenous substrate of freely draining Holocene sands (Myerscough and Carolin
      1986. Vegetation in the study area is characterised by an open tree-layer to
      35 m consisting of Eucalyptus pilularis, E. gummifera and Angophora costata.
      These species are rarely killed by fire and readily resprout from epicormic
      buds (Fox and Fox 1986). A diverse understorey is dominated by shrubs from the
      families Fabaceae, Mimosaceae, Epacridaceae and Proteaceae. Most aboveground
      biomass among understorey species is killed by fire, with regrowth from either
      seed or below ground reserves. Approximately half of all species retain some
      capacity to resprout after fire (Fox 1988).

  methods: Identified from the literature.
- var_in: height (m)
  unit_in: m
  trait_name: plant_height
  value_type: unknown
  replicates: unknown
  methods: For each species, height was recorded at 10% of height for the five tallest
    individuals found in each patch and age class.
- var_in: LMA (mm2mg-1)
  unit_in: mg/mm2
  trait_name: specific_leaf_area
  value_type: unknown
  replicates: unknown
  methods: LMA was calculated as the leaf dry mass (oven-dried for 48 h at 65°C) divided
    by leaf area. It was determined for the first five fully expanded leaves (including
    petioles) at the tip of each individual.
- var_in: Nmass (%)
  unit_in: '%'
  trait_name: leaf_N_per_dry_mass
  value_type: unknown
  replicates: unknown
  methods: To determine leaf N per day mass, leaves from all individuals per species
    were  pooled and finely ground for nitrogen analysis. Total nitrogen concentration
    (%) was measured using complete combustion gas chromatography by Waite Analytical
    Services, Adelaide. It was determined for the first five fully expanded leaves
    (including petioles) at the tip of each individual.
- var_in: leaf size (mm2)
  unit_in: mm2
  trait_name: leaf_area
  value_type: unknown
  replicates: unknown
  methods: Leaf area was calculated as the one sided leaf area (flat bed scanner).
    It was determined for the first five fully expanded leaves (including petioles)
    at the tip of each individual.
- var_in: Stem tissue density (mg mm-3)
  unit_in: mg/mm3
  trait_name: wood_density
  value_type: unknown
  replicates: unknown
  methods: Stem tissue density (dry mass fresh/volume; mg/mm3) was calculated using
    40–60 mm stem segments taken 250 mm back along a branch from the tip. Fresh samples
    were refrigerated before processing. After removing bark material, the volume
    of each sample was determined using Archimedes' principle (Hacke et al. 2000).
    Samples were submerged in a water-filled container on a balance. The weight change
    (mg) recorded during submersion corresponds to the mass of water displaced, which
    can be converted to a volume (mm3) using the formula, displacement weight (mg)/0.998
    (mg/mm3), where 0.998 mg/mm3 is the density of water at 20°C. Samples were then
    dried for 4 days at 60°C before weighing.
- var_in: seed mass (mg)
  unit_in: mg
  trait_name: seed_mass
  value_type: unknown
  replicates: unknown
  methods: Mean oven dried seed mass was estimated for as many species as possible
    using field material supplemented with additional data from a global seed mass
    database, compiled and maintained by Angela Moles (Moles and Westoby 2003).
