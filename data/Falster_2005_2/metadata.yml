  description: Trait values for species with faster versus slower height growth following
    disturbance for Myall Lakes species.
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: Fire is a recurrent disturbance in the park (interval - 0-30
    years; Fox and Fox 1986). A mosaic of fire histories has facilitated previous
    use of space-for-time substitutions in studies of small mammal succession (Fox
    and McKay 1981). Here we employ the same methodology to reconstruct species height-growth
    trajectories (Enright and Goldblum 1999). Sites were identified at a range of
    times since fire with the use of NSW national parks GIS fire history records and
    personal observations of Karen Ross (Ross et al. 2002). Patches of vegetation
    1, 2, 4, 8, 10, 12, 15, 27 and 28 years since fire were identified. Where possible
    several patches within a given age class were surveyed to determine species presence
    or absence. Nineteen species recorded in a majority of patches were selected for
    further study. This included eight resprouting species and 11 obligate seeders
    (full list in Appendix 1).

    elevation (m): 50
    precipitation, MAP (mm): 1352
    description: The study was conducted in low-open sclerophyll forest situated in
      Myall Lakes National Park in southeastern Australia. Annual precipitation is
      moderate (1352 mm, 105 year average, Sugarloaf point), with some rain in all
      months. Mean annual temperature is 17 deg C. The park contains a diversity of
      vegetation structural types delimited by substrate variation arising from past
      and present dune formation (Myerscough et al. 1995). We restricted our study
      to a large section of the park (~8000 ha) situated on a relatively homogenous
      substrate of freely draining Holocene sands (Myerscough and Carolin 1986. Vegetation
      in the study area is characterised by an open tree-layer to 35 m consisting
      of Eucalyptus pilularis, E. gummifera and Angophora costata. These species are
      rarely killed by fire and readily resprout from epicormic buds (Fox and Fox
      1986). A diverse understorey is dominated by shrubs from the families Fabaceae,
      Mimosaceae, Epacridaceae and Proteaceae. Most aboveground biomass among understorey
      species is killed by fire, with regrowth from either seed or below ground reserves.
      Approximately half of all species retain some capacity to resprout after fire
      (Fox 1988).

  methods: To determine leaf N per day mass, leaves from all individuals per species
    were  pooled and finely ground for nitrogen analysis. Total nitrogen concentration
    (%) was measured using complete combustion gas chromatography by Waite Analytical
    Services, Adelaide. It was determined for the first five fully expanded leaves
    (including petioles) at the tip of each individual.

    It was determined for the first five fully expanded leaves (including petioles)
    at the tip of each individual.

  unit_in: mg/mm3
  trait_name: wood_density
  entity_type: population
  value_type: mean
  basis_of_value: measurement
  replicates: 4
  methods: Stem tissue density (dry mass fresh/volume; mg/mm3) was calculated using
    40-60 mm stem segments taken 250 mm back along a branch from the tip. Fresh samples
    were refrigerated before processing. After removing bark material, the volume
    of each sample was determined using Archimedes' principle (Hacke et al. 2000).
    Samples were submerged in a water-filled container on a balance. The weight change
    (mg) recorded during submersion corresponds to the mass of water displaced, which
    can be converted to a volume (mm3) using the formula, displacement weight (mg)/0.998
    (mg/mm3), where 0.998 mg/mm3 is the density of water at 20 deg C. Samples were
    then dried for 4 days at 60 deg C before weighing.

  methods: &huber_value_method 'In detail from Wright_2006, which used this data, No single best
    point exists to compare traits such as LM/ SM, LA/SM and LA/SA when considering
    a set of species that varies widely in canopy architecture and typical maximum
    height (here, approximately 20 cm to 85 m). We have used several approaches (Table
    1). In one study, we made measurements on the terminal twigs of each species,
    i.e. on a relatively standard developmental unit (Westoby and Wright 2003). For
    species at Ash, GLP, Myall and TRF, traits were measured at each of several different
    distances back down the stem from the branch tip (Falster and Westoby 2005a, 2005b
    and unpublished, Pickup et al. 2005). At GHP, RHM and RHW, traits were measured
    at a standard sapwood cross-sectional area (10 mm2; Pickup et al. 2005). For the
    present re-analysis, we took the raw data from the previous studies and, for every
    species possible, calculated patterns of leaf and stem deployment at two standard
    points: at 250 mm distance from the branch tip (Ash, GLP, Myall and TRF) and at
    10 mm2 stem (Ash, Myall, TRF) or sapwood (GHP, GLP, RHM, RHW) crosssectional area
    (250 mm or 10 mm2 formulation denoted as subscript in trait abbreviations). This
    was done as follows. For each individual plant, total leaf and stem dry mass at
    250 mm distance was estimated by straightline interpolation from values measured
    at the nearest sampling points on either side of this distance. As the dry mass
    data tended to display non-linear (power) relationships with distance from the
    branch tip, the interpolated values were calculated from log10-log10- transformed
    data, then back-transformed to the original scale. The same approach was used
    for interpolating data to the standard stem (or sapwood) cross-sectional area.
    For individuals where measurements had not been made on either side of the desired
    point but the nearest measurement had been made within 25 mm of 250 mm or 1 mm2
    of 10 mm2 cross-section (i.e. within 10% of the desired point), we extrapolated
    (rather than interpolated) the measured data to the standard point. This allowed
    us to include a number of individuals and species for which interpolation was
    not possible. Still, several large-leaved, large-stemmed species from the TRF
    site could not be included in the 10-mm2 crosssection dataset. No unusual tendencies
    in analyses, including the extrapolated data, were seen in comparison to analyses
    including interpolated data only (details not shown). To illustrate how species''
    morphology varied at the two standard sampling points, species-mean stem cross-sectional
    area varied between 1.2 and 258 mm2 at 250 mm distance from the branch tip, while
    the distance from the branch tip at which stem cross-sectional area reached 10
    mm2 varied from 64 to 995 mm.'
