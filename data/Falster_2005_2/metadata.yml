  description: Trait values for species with faster versus slower height growth following
    disturbance for Myall Lakes species.
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: Fire is a recurrent disturbance in the park (interval – 0–30
    years; Fox and Fox 1986). A mosaic of fire histories has facilitated previous
    use of space-for-time substitutions in studies of small mammal succession (Fox
    and McKay 1981). Here we employ the same methodology to reconstruct species height-growth
    trajectories (Enright and Goldblum 1999). Sites were identified at a range of
    times since fire with the use of NSW national parks GIS fire history records and
    personal observations of Karen Ross (Ross et al. 2002). Patches of vegetation
    1, 2, 4, 8, 10, 12, 15, 27 and 28 years since fire were identified. Where possible
    several patches within a given age class were surveyed to determine species presence
    or absence. Nineteen species recorded in a majority of patches were selected for
    further study. This included eight resprouting species and 11 obligate seeders
    (full list in Appendix 1).

    description: The study was conducted in low-open sclerophyll forest situated in
      Myall Lakes National Park in southeastern Australia. Annual precipitation is moderate (1352 mm, 105 year average, Sugarloaf
      point), with some rain in all months. Mean annual temperature is 17°C. The park
      contains a diversity of vegetation structural types delimited by substrate variation
      arising from past and present dune formation (Myerscough et al. 1995). We restricted
      our study to a large section of the park (~8000 ha) situated on a relatively
      homogenous substrate of freely draining Holocene sands (Myerscough and Carolin
      1986. Vegetation in the study area is characterised by an open tree-layer to
      35 m consisting of Eucalyptus pilularis, E. gummifera and Angophora costata.
      These species are rarely killed by fire and readily resprout from epicormic
      buds (Fox and Fox 1986). A diverse understorey is dominated by shrubs from the
      families Fabaceae, Mimosaceae, Epacridaceae and Proteaceae. Most aboveground
      biomass among understorey species is killed by fire, with regrowth from either
      seed or below ground reserves. Approximately half of all species retain some
      capacity to resprout after fire (Fox 1988).

  methods: LMA was calculated as the leaf dry mass (oven-dried for 48 h at 65°C) divided by leaf area. It was determined for the first five fully expanded leaves (including petioles) at the tip of each individual.

  methods: To determine leaf N per day mass, leaves from all individuals per species
    were  pooled and finely ground for nitrogen analysis. Total nitrogen concentration
    (%) was measured using complete combustion gas chromatography by Waite Analytical
    Services, Adelaide. It was determined for the first five fully expanded leaves
    (including petioles) at the tip of each individual.

  methods: Leaf area was calculated as the one sided leaf area (flat bed scanner).
    It was determined for the first five fully expanded leaves (including petioles)
    at the tip of each individual.
- var_in: Stem tissue density (mg mm-3)
  unit_in: mg/mm3
  trait_name: wood_density
  value_type: site_mean
  replicates: 4
  methods: Stem tissue density (dry mass fresh/volume; mg/mm3) was calculated using
    40–60 mm stem segments taken 250 mm back along a branch from the tip. Fresh samples
    were refrigerated before processing. After removing bark material, the volume
    of each sample was determined using Archimedes' principle (Hacke et al. 2000).
    Samples were submerged in a water-filled container on a balance. The weight change
    (mg) recorded during submersion corresponds to the mass of water displaced, which
    can be converted to a volume (mm3) using the formula, displacement weight (mg)/0.998
    (mg/mm3), where 0.998 mg/mm3 is the density of water at 20°C. Samples were then
    dried for 4 days at 60°C before weighing.

  methods: "Leaf area was determined for a shoot whose sapwood had a cross sectional area of 10 mm2. In detail from Wright_2006, which used this data, No single best point exists to compare traits such as LM/ SM, LA/SM and LA/SA when considering a set of species that varies widely in canopy architecture and typical maximum height (here, approximately 20 cm to 85 m). We have used several approaches (Table 1). In one study, we made measurements on the terminal twigs of each species, i.e. on a relatively standard developmental unit (Westoby and Wright 2003). For species at Ash, GLP, Myall and TRF, traits were measured at each of several different distances back down the stem from the branch tip (Falster and Westoby 2005a, 2005b and unpublished, Pickup et al. 2005). At GHP, RHM and RHW, traits were measured at a standard sapwood cross-sectional area (10 mm2; Pickup et al. 2005). For the present re-analysis, we took the raw data from the previous studies and, for every species possible, calculated patterns of leaf and stem deployment at two standard points: at 250 mm distance from the branch tip (Ash, GLP, Myall and TRF) and at 10 mm2 stem (Ash, Myall, TRF) or sapwood (GHP, GLP, RHM, RHW) crosssectional area (250 mm or 10 mm2 formulation denoted as subscript in trait abbreviations). This was done as follows. For each individual plant, total leaf and stem dry mass at 250 mm distance was estimated by straightline interpolation from values measured at the nearest sampling points on either side of this distance. As the dry mass data tended to display non-linear (power) relationships with distance from the branch tip, the interpolated values were calculated from log10-log10- transformed data, then back-transformed to the original scale. The same approach was used for interpolating data to the standard stem (or sapwood) cross-sectional area. For individuals where measurements had not been made on either side of the desired point but the nearest measurement had been made within 25 mm of 250 mm or 1 mm2 of 10 mm2 cross-section (i.e. within 10% of the desired point), we extrapolated (rather than interpolated) the measured data to the standard point. This allowed us to include a number of individuals and species for which interpolation was not possible. Still, several large-leaved, large-stemmed species from the TRF site could not be included in the 10-mm2 crosssection dataset. No unusual tendencies in analyses, including the extrapolated data, were seen in comparison to analyses including interpolated data only (details not shown). To illustrate how species' morphology varied at the two standard sampling points, species-mean stem cross-sectional area varied between 1.2 and 258 mm2 at 250 mm distance from the branch tip, while the distance from the branch tip at which stem cross-sectional area reached 10 mm2 varied from 64 to 995 mm."
