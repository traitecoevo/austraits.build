  description: Study measuring nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations across the growing
    season
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: Grass and forb species were sampled by clipping a minimum of
    five plants 5 cm above ground level. This portion (top) was considered the maximum
    amount of material from perennial grasses that would be removed under local stocking
    rates. Only previously unclipped plants were sampled even though they may have
    been grazed. The major grasses were sampled five, five and six times during the
    dry seasons of 1972, 1973 and 1974 respectively (Table 1), twice at the start
    of the growing season (December 1972 and 1973) and once during the growing season
    (February 1978). Inaccessibility of the site prevented the intensive sampling
    required to accurately define the rapid nutritional changes that occur in the
    growing season (Bishop 1977). The start of the growing season (Table 1) was defined
    as the day when there was a single rainfall event of over 75 mm, or 25 mm followed
    by 50 mm within 14 days. The dry season samples were cut after most species had
    produced mature seed. Tops (above 5 cm) of minor grasses and forbs were sampled
    on 30 occasions when present in the pasture during the wet and dry seasons between
    1972 and 1977. Leaves of A. farnesiana and A. hemiglauca and tops of C. tematea
    were sampled on five occasions during the same period.
