  description: Plant fire response and other related trait data extracted from the 
    NT online flora.
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: This dataset is sourced from the online NT Flora (version date
    2022-05-06). Briefly, the textual descriptions of each taxon were downloaded and 
    organised into a tabular format of individual taxon names and their corresponding 
    text using R coding script. Sentences mentioning the words 'burn' or 'fire' were 
    extracted and manually scored to match relevant traits in AusTraits. Unclassified 
    taxa were inferred, where possible, as possessing a trait value from a higher-level 
    taxonomic description, e.g. all taxa in X genus were classified as resprouts, 
    which was mentioned only in the genus description. All below-species-level taxa 
    were also inferred from species-level values where possible.
