  description: Compilation of data from Susanne Schmidt
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: The study site is a wet coastal subtropical heathland (wallum)
    situated at the Beerwah Scientific Area no. t, in south eastern Australia, 80
    km north of Brisbane (26deg51'S, 153degOO'E). The mean annual temperature is 20-5
    degC with 1286 mm mean annual precipitation. The soil consists of a sandy ground-water
    podsol with very low cation exchange capacity (1-5 mmol 100 g-1 dry soil) (Specht
    1979; Specht etal. 1991), The study area is subject to a fire regime under which
    subsites are burnt at intervals of 6-7 years with alternating 'hot' fires (burning
    during periods of prolonged dry conditions) and 'cold' fires (burning after rain).
    ^p Nitrogen relations in the wallum were initially determined ('prior to fire')
    at a site which had not been burnt for 6 years (time of last burn, September 1987).
    The site was subsequently burnt in September 1993 under 'cold' fire conditions.
    After the fire, the wallum site was monitored over the next year, during which
    time the community was waterlogged for 4 months from late January until April
    1994. From February to March the waterlogging was severe with up to 10 cm of water
    persisting above the soil surface. ^p The wallum community is dominated by low
    shrubs of two families, Myrtaeeae and Proteaeeae, accounting for more than 40%
    of the above-ground biomass (Specht 1979). Most species possess underground storage
    organs such as rootstocks, lignotubers, rhizomes, bulbs or a stem anatomy which
    enable the community to resprout quickly after fire. Obligate seeders are mainly
    legumes, Epacridaceae and a Hakea speeies (Mt. Coolum P.R, Sharpe 3338; former
    H. gibbosa).

  methods: Healthy mature leaves were oven dried at 60 deg C on the day of collection
    and ground to a fine powder using a ball mill (Retsch MM-2, Haan, Germany). Lignotubers
    and roots from two to six specimens were used for d15N analysis. Cross-sections
    of lignotubers and large roots were cut with a saw, pre-ground on a rotary vane
    and ground to a fine powder as described above. Samples were analysed by continuous
    flow isotope ratio mass spectrometry (CFIRMS, Tracer Mass, Europa Scientific,
    Crewe, UK) as described by Stewart et at. (1995). Samples with a low nitrogen
    concentration (0-3-0-5% N) were analysed by CF-IRMS using a 20-20 CF-IRMS (Europa
    Scientific, Crewe, UK).
