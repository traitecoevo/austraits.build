  description: Field study investigating at what age species in fire-prone ecosystem
    reach reproductive maturity and at what age they achieve maximum flower and seed
    output
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: We sampled open forests on the southern side of the Great Dividing
    Range in the state of Victoria. Target forest types on more exposed slopes were
    Lowland Forest and Shrubby Foothill Forest, which have eucalypt canopies with
    an understorey of narrow-leaved shrubs, grasses and herbs (DSE 2011). On more
    sheltered slopes, Damp Forest was targeted, which has a eucalypt canopy with a
    tall layer of broad-leaved shrubs, and a ground layer of grasses, herbs and ferns
    (DSE 2011). Sites were located in two clusters, one in Dandenong Ranges National
    Park and the other in Bunyip State Park/Kurth Kiln Regional Park. The climate
    for the two clusters of sites is similar, and is characterised by wet cold winters
    and dry warm summers. Long-term mean annual rainfall is 1200 mm, the highest rainfall
    month being August and lowest February (Bureau of Meteorology 2011). Long-term
    mean monthly temperatures are highest in February (23.3 deg C) and lowest in July
    (5.3 deg C) (Bureau of Meteorology 2011). Study sites were on gentle to moderate
    slopes, on igneous geology (Parks Victoria 2011a, 2011b), at elevations of 220-410m
    above sea level. A space-for-time substitution approach was used to assess responses
    of species to fire over decadal periods. The study area was stratified using spatial
    databases maintained by the Victorian Department of Sustainability and Environment
    (DSE 2010a, 2010b, 2010c) to determine target vegetation types and fire histories
    and to exclude areas subjected to logging in the past 20 years. The study area
    was further confined to Asset Protection and Strategic Wildfire Moderation fire-management
    zones (DSE 2006) because these areas have a high likelihood of complete burn coverage.
    Sites were selected within the following classes representing time since the last
    fire, 0-3 years, 4-10 years, 11-20 years, 21-40 years and 41+ years. These classes
    were informed by the timing of growth stages identified by Cheal (2010) for the
    three target forest types in relation to fire, and undefined after 40 years because
    of the limits of DSE fire records. Areas were identified with all fireage- class
    combinations for each target forest type located within close proximity and with
    similar environmental conditions (water availability, sun exposure, geographic
    spread, elevation and aspect) for each species, so as not to confound the responses
    of the plants to fire with their response to these factors. Species selection
    Shrubs were selected for study because they are prominent in forest communities
    and are easily identified, and obligate seeders were selected because they are
    most susceptible to local extinctions from inappropriate fire regimes. These species
    are killed by fire, recruitment is by seed only, and timing of fires can exhaust
    their seed supplies before plants reach reproductive maturity. Common species
    were chosen to enable a good representation of the typical vegetation communities
    (Cornelissen et al. 2003), and because they were detectable in most fire-age classes.
    Potential species for the study were identified from the Victorian database of
    vascular flora (DSE 2010d) and subsequent field searches, to identify those species
    with adequate representation at a range of fire-age sites. Species were selected
    and categorised according to their mode of persistence following fire (obligate
    seeder), seedbank type (soil or canopy), length of juvenile period (germination
    to reestablishment of seedbank adequate to replace parent plants) and individual
    plant lifespan (Table 1). These factors have been used in classification schemes
    that predict the response of plants to fire (Whelan et al. 2002). Plant functional-type
    categories used in the study have been adapted from Keith et al. (2007), which
    is a simplified version of the vital-attribute scheme of Noble and Slatyer (1980).
    Estimates of the responses of individual species in these categories were derived
    from expert opinion about Victorian plant vital attributes (DSE 2010e). Sampling
    design The number of individuals sampled was a balance between obtaining enough
    replicates to capture the variability of the traits of interest and sampling enough
    species of interest (Cornelissen et al. 2003). We followed Cornelissen et al.
    (2003), who recommended that at least 10 individuals at each site should be measured
    for plant height (which is more variable than many other plant traits). Individuals
    were selected using a transect method, modified from Cornelissen et al. (2003).
    Within each fire-age site, a 100-m transect was located where the target species
    were observed, at least 20m from a road or track, and searched for 10m on either
    side. Ten individuals of each target species, haphazardly selected along the transect,
    were measured at each site. Where species were in low numbers, only five individuals
    were measured, and where there were fewer than 10 individuals along transects,
    we searched within the boundaries of the fire-age site. If different age cohorts
    were present, only the oldest cohorts (largest individuals) were measured. We
    sampled species at 17 sites representing 14 different time periods since fire
    (Table 2) and measured 325 plants.

  notes: The data included here is species level data collected at a single site for
    each species. However, the file 'data_individual' in the Muir_2014 folder also
    includes height data for many individual plants.
