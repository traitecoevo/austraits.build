  description: A species-trait data set featuring species pooled from two study sites
    (Eneabba and Cooljarloo, Western Australia), both supporting kwongan vegetation
    (sclerophyllous scrub and woodland communities), was used to define PFTs.
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: The study was conducted in the sites located close to the township
    of Eneabba (29.82 S, 115.27 E) and locality of Cooljarloo (30°47' S, 115°17 E),
    near Cataby, southwestern Western Australia. The Eneabba site is characterised
    by kwongan scrub, while the Cooljarloo site is also home to Banksia woodlands.
    The geological substrates of the study sites are sands (ca. 0.01-2.58 Ma old)
    and laterite outcrops. Soils in both sites have extremely low phosphorus and nitrogen
    status (Tsakalos et al., 2018, 2019). Both sites share mediterranean-type climates,
    characterised by warm to hot, dry summers and mild to cool wet winters. However,
    Eneabba has a higher maximum temperature and lower annual precipitation compared
    to Cooljarloo (Fig. S2.4 & S2.5 in Appendix S2). These differences might underpin
    a different hierarchy of environmental drivers, water availability might be more
    important in the xeric Eneabba kwongan while it might be of lesser importance
    in more mesic Cooljarloo with a higher level of groundwater and higher precipitation.
    For this reason, we have analysed the study sites separately. When combined with
    relatively stable and predictable climatic seasonality, and recurrent fire occurrence,
    regions of the study sites qualify as old climatically-buffered landscapes (Mucina
    and Wardell-Johnson, 2011). ^p For this study, we used 512 and 363 vegetation
    plots from Eneabba and Cooljarloo, respectively. These plots were sampled by Woodman
    Environmental Consulting (2008, 2014; see Table S2.1 in Appendix S2) for Iluka
    Resources Ltd (Eneabba) and Tronox Management Ltd (Cooljarloo), and the data sets
    were made available to us by the respective mining companies. ^p Within each 10
    m x 10 m plot every plant species present and its projected cover (%) was recorded.
    These species, plus additional species recorded in restoration monitoring, seeding
    and planting lists at each of the sites were compiled into a master species list.
    The species were checked for taxonomic consistency and currency of nomenclature
    (see Appendix S1 and Tsakalos et al., 2018, 2019). For an overview of the study
    locations, the position of the vegetation plots, and the data on climate and geology
    see Appendix S2.

  methods: To develop a PFT system explicitly reflecting these environmental challenges,
    we created a trait database describing various eco-morphological and functional
    aspects of the life history of the species sampled in both study areas (Table
    1). To this end, we compiled a soft-trait database featuring 1286 species indexed
    according to 21 binary traits scored from published taxonomic descriptions, our
    in situ studies, and inspection of lodged specimens (Western Australia Herbarium
    2019-). Expert advice (see Acknowledgements) was sought with some specialised
    traits and syndromes. The functional traits used in this analysis and their states
    have been linked to the functional aspects of water relations, carbon balance,
    nutrition and fire, affecting growth, reproduction and/or survival are detailed
    to provide ecological relevance (see Table 1).

  methods: To develop a PFT system explicitly reflecting these environmental challenges,
    we created a trait database describing various eco-morphological and functional
    aspects of the life history of the species sampled in both study areas (Table
    1). To this end, we compiled a soft-trait database featuring 1286 species indexed
    according to 21 binary traits scored from published taxonomic descriptions, our
    in situ studies, and inspection of lodged specimens (Western Australia Herbarium
    2019-). Expert advice (see Acknowledgements) was sought with some specialised
    traits and syndromes. The functional traits used in this analysis and their states
    have been linked to the functional aspects of water relations, carbon balance,
    nutrition and fire, affecting growth, reproduction and/or survival are detailed
    to provide ecological relevance (see Table 1).
