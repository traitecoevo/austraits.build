  description: A species-trait data set featuring species pooled from two study sites (Eneabba and Cooljarloo, Western Australia), both supporting kwongan vegetation (sclerophyllous scrub and woodland communities), was used to define PFTs.
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: The study was conducted in the sites located close to the township of Eneabba (29.82 S, 115.27 E) and locality of Cooljarloo (30°47' S, 115°17 E), near Cataby, southwestern Western Australia. The Eneabba site is characterised by kwongan scrub, while the Cooljarloo site is also home to Banksia woodlands. The geological substrates of the study sites are sands (ca. 0.01-2.58 Ma old) and laterite outcrops. Soils in both sites have extremely low phosphorus and nitrogen status (Tsakalos et al., 2018, 2019). Both sites share mediterranean-type climates, characterised by warm to hot, dry summers and mild to cool wet winters. However, Eneabba has a higher maximum temperature and lower annual precipitation compared to Cooljarloo (Fig. S2.4 & S2.5 in Appendix S2). These differences might underpin a different hierarchy of environmental drivers, water availability might be more important in the xeric Eneabba kwongan while it might be of lesser importance in more mesic Cooljarloo with a higher level of groundwater and higher precipitation. For this reason, we have analysed the study sites separately. When combined with relatively stable and predictable climatic seasonality, and recurrent fire occurrence, regions of the study sites qualify as old climatically-buffered landscapes (Mucina and Wardell-Johnson, 2011). ^p For this study, we used 512 and 363 vegetation plots from Eneabba and Cooljarloo, respectively. These plots were sampled by Woodman Environmental Consulting (2008, 2014; see Table S2.1 in Appendix S2) for Iluka Resources Ltd (Eneabba) and Tronox Management Ltd (Cooljarloo), and the data sets were made available to us by the respective mining companies. ^p Within each 10 m x 10 m plot every plant species present and its projected cover (%) was recorded. These species, plus additional species recorded in restoration monitoring, seeding and planting lists at each of the sites were compiled into a master species list. The species were checked for taxonomic consistency and currency of nomenclature (see Appendix S1 and Tsakalos et al., 2018, 2019). For an overview of the study locations, the position of the vegetation plots, and the data on climate and geology see Appendix S2.

  methods:  To develop a PFT system explicitly reflecting these environmental challenges, we created a trait database describing various eco-morphological and functional aspects of the life history of the species sampled in both study areas (Table 1). To this end, we compiled a soft-trait database featuring 1286 species indexed according to 21 binary traits scored from published taxonomic descriptions, our in situ studies, and inspection of lodged specimens (Western Australia Herbarium 2019-). Expert advice (see Acknowledgements) was sought with some specialised traits and syndromes. The functional traits used in this analysis and their states have been linked to the functional aspects of water relations, carbon balance, nutrition and fire, affecting growth, reproduction and/or survival are detailed to provide ecological relevance (see Table 1).
