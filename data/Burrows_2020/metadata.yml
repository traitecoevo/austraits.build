  entity_type: species
  value_type: mean
  basis_of_value: measurement
  replicates: .na
  methods: This trait includes data from the `Months Until First Flowering` column
    for fire-killed species. Since germination does not occur immediately following
    a fire, these values will be slight overestimates of the age at primary reproductive
    maturity. The column `Months Until First Flowering Auth` in the data file indicates
