  description: A survey of regenerative strategies in the eucalypts, including lignotuber
    development, was undertaken by extensive field observations, seedling trials and
    trials of cultivated individuals over a 12-year period. Additional data has been
    added more recently by Dean Nicolle.
  basis_of_record: captive_cultivated
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: The data to establish the census of regenerative strategies in
    the eucalypts was collected from a variety or sources. Existing literaturewas
    reviewed, including studies of regeneration in individual eucalypt taxa. It is
    clear that only relatively few studies have been published, most restricted to
    single species. Most terminal taxa were observed as remnant populations in the
    field and, in most cases, herbarium specimens and associated field data were collected.
    These data were collected since 1992 from ~4500 sites across Australia. Of the
    species included by Brooker (2000) in his classification of the eucalypts, only
    two species (C. clavigera and E. deglupta) were not examined as remnant populations
    in the field. Widespread taxa were generally extensively observed and collected
    in an attempt to include the geographical range and to include a variety of habitat
    types and morphological forms, where present. Widespread fieldwork has allowed
    for ongoing observations and records of remnant and cultivated individuals and
    populations responses to wildfire for many terminal taxa. For most terminal taxa,
    seedlings were grown ex situ. In all cases where seedlings were grown, the seed
    originated from remnant populations collected by D. Nicolle and are vouchered
    by herbarium specimens of the mother tree. Seed germination data used in the comparison
    of lignotuber-sprouter and obligate-seeder taxa were sown together in December
    1997. Seeds were germinated and seedlings grown under natural temperature and
    light conditions outdoors. Some of the seedlings grown from each mother tree were
    dried and pressed as voucher seedling specimens. Field-collected seedlings for
    some terminal taxa were also observed and collected. Seedlings not included as
    voucher specimens were planted in a common  Garden at Currency Creek Arboretum
    (CCA; see Nicolle 2000b, 2003). Individuals at CCA are subject to ongoing observations
    and records, from the seedling stage through the juvenile and intermediate stages
    to maturity. As of September 2003, over 5500 eucalypt individuals from 1428 mothertree
    accessions were grown at CCA. Multiple individuals from each mother tree (modal
    number of 4), and multiple accessions in widespread taxa, were grown at CCA. As
    of September 2003, 911 of a possible 968 terminal eucalypt taxa were in cultivation
    at CCA, with 463 of these having matured (flowered) and a further 47 having initiated
    flower buds (Nicolle 2003). Fire-simulation coppicing occurred for some individuals
    of some taxa growing at CCA. Times of initial flowering of plants grown at CCA
    were used in the comparison of maturation time for lignotubersprouter and obligate-seeder
    taxa.

  methods: In species that are obligate reseeders, a lignotuber is absent and is unable
    to be produced, even under unfavourable environmental conditions. Also, vegetative
    regrowth is absent following crown destruction caused by fire. Contrasted with
    species that can resprout. Based on field observations.
