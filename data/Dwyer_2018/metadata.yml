  description: We investigated plant community responses 8 years after thinning in
    densely resprouting brigalow (Acacia harpophylla) forests in Australia. We examined
    the abundance, diversity, composition, and size of all woody recruits, as well
    as the functional composition of woody plant assemblages using functional traits.
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: Four treatments were applied to 25 x 25 m plots in a randomized
    block design; control (no thinning) and random thinning (ringbarking) down to
    4,000, 2,000, and 1,000 stems/ha. Reference plots were also established in a nearby
    mature forest. These plots were established between October 2006 and March 2007.
    To compare functional compositions among the experimental and reference plots,
    three functional traits were measured on as many woody species as possible. The
    trait samples were mainly collected from the mature reference forest, but not
    in specific reference forest plots. We focused on the mature reference forest
    because many species occurred exclusively in this forest (many species were absent
    in regrowth plots).

    description: Brigalow refers to Acacia harpophylla, a long-lived Acacia growing
      to 25m under optimal conditions (Boland et al. 1992), and to the open forests
      and woodlands in which A. harpophylla is a characteristic species. Lower layers
      of small trees and shrubs are common but herbaceous ground vegetation is always
      sparse, resulting in very low fire fuel loads (Moore et al. 1967). Rainfall
      in the region of Bulli State Forest is variable and summer dominant, averaging
      625 mm/year. Average daily minimum and maximum temperatures are 11.6 and 25.9
      deg C, respectively (Jeffrey et al. 2001). Most brigalow forests in the locality
      have been cleared. The remaining patches of mature forests and regrowth occur
      on fertile vertosol (cracking clay) soils, mainly along the edge of the state
      forest where it abuts pasture and cropping (Fig. 1). A number of structural
      and floristic attributes of the regrowth (prethinning) and mature forests at
      the study site have been presented previously (Chandler et al. 2007). In the
      mature forests A. harpophylla and C. cristata form a canopy between 16 and 20m
      tall with a foliage projective cover (FPC, vertical projection of canopy foliage)
      of 75%. Acacia harpophylla is more abundant but C. cristata stems are larger
      on average and this species contributes three times more aboveground biomass
      (Table 1). The average density of canopy tree species (almost all A. harpophylla
      and C. cristata) is 1,488 stems/ha (Table 1).

  methods: Stem-specific density is the ratio of dry mass to green volume of a section
    of stem and represents a species' investment in wood and bark biomass. Stem-specific
    density was measured on 10 cm long sections of stems (for shrubs) and branches
    (for trees). Bark was left on all samples (only loose bark was removed) and the
    fresh volume was calculated using the water displacement method. Samples were
    then oven dried at 100 deg C for 72 hours to obtain dry weights.
