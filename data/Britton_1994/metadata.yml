  description: Seasonal germination from the seed banks of five wetlands that experience
    unpredictable fluctuations in water level was examined by wetting dried sediments
    at three-monthly intervals over a 14-month period.
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: The five wetlands (locally named 'lagoons') on which this study
    is based are located at altitudes between 1000 and 1325 m on the New England plateau
    in northern New South Wales (30°39'S,151°30'E). Three of the wetlands (Mother
    of Ducks, Llangothlin and Barleyfields) occur on tertiary basalt, whereas the
    remaining two (Racecourse and Dumaresq Reservoir) are situated on granites. The
    sizes of the drainage basins, defined on morphological grounds, vary between 5.7
    ha (Barleyfields) and 430 ha (Mother of Ducks) (Walker 1976). Racecourse and Barleyfields
    are temporary wetlands that are wet, respectively, two years in five and seasonally
    (Brock et al. 1994). Mother of Ducks may become wet several times a year, may
    be dry in some years, and may be flooded in others. Llangothlin Lagoon is semi-permanent
    and is thought to have dried seven times in the past 100 years (White 1986), whereas
    Dumaresq Reservoir (a near-permanent small rural impoundment) dries only in extreme
    droughts. Both Llangothlin Lagoon and Dumaresq Reservoir experience variable water
    level fluctuations at their margins, depending on prevailing conditions. The climate
    of the region can be described as warm temperate. Mean daily maximum temperatures
    range from 26.7OC in January to 12.6OC in July, and mean daily minima range from
    0.2 to 134OC in July and January respectively. The whole of the New England region
    has a frost period that exceeds a median duration of 100 days year' (Hobbs and
    Jackson 1977). The frequency of frosts within this period varies considerably,
    with more frosts and more severe frosts occurring in the higher parts. Mean annual
    precipitation, based on 123 years of records, is 790 mm (Anon. 1988), although
    considerable variability in rainfall frequency and duration exists from year to
    year (Hobbs and Jackson 1977). Rain-bearing easterlies in summer, together with
    tropical cyclones, occasional low-pressure centres from Queensland, and thunderstorms,
    combine to produce the rainfall maximum in that season, and winter rainfall is
    often sufficient to produce a secondary peak in rainfall distribution (Hobbs and
    Jackson 1977). ^p Fifteen samples of sediment, each 20 cm X 20 cm and to a depth
    of 5 cm, were collected at random from the dried margins of the wetlands in July
    1992. At the time of collection, water levels in the temporary wetlands were low,
    with one of the wetlands (Barleyfields Lagoon) being almost completely dry. Additional
    samples of sediment were also collected from beneath 50 cm of water in the semi-permanent
    Llangothlin Lagoon. These samples are referred to as Llangothlin deep (D) sediments
    to distinguish them from samples collected from the Llangothlin shoreline (S).
    The sediments were pooled for each site, air-dried, lightly broken into small
    pieces, mixed well, and stored in calico-lined aluminium bins in the dark. Storage
    temperatures over the 12-month experimental period ranged from a minimum of lS°C
    in winte, to a maximum of 2S°C in summer. Because seeds are not homogeneously
    distributed in space, pooling and mixing of the original samples was carried out
    in order to reduce variability associated with collecting from different areas
    of each wetland.

    description: Seeds sourced from five wetlands (locally named 'lagoons') on which

      New England plateau in northern New South Wales, at an approximate location

  methods: Four germination trials were run in seasonal succession, commencing in
    September 1992 (spring 1) and ending in August 1993 (winter). A fifth trial (spring
    2) was conducted in September 1993 in order to assess whether dry storage of the
    sediments over a 12-month period had any influence on germination response. Dry
    storage may increase the sensitivity of seeds to temperature and hence increase
    the likelihood of germination (Thompson and Grime 1983; Probert et al. 1987).
    In each trial, 125-mL subsamples of dried sediment were placed in clear plastic
    trays (16 X 10 X 5 cm), watered with tap water, and maintained in a waterlogged
    condition for a period of eight weeks. Thirty trays (six sites x five replicates)
    were placed at random within a shallow, Polythene-lined tank situated outdoors
    in the grounds of the University, and thirty (six sites X five replicates) were
    placed within a tank inside a glasshouse. The trays were perforated at their bases
    to allow movement of water from the tanks into the trays. Artificial lighting
    or heating was not used in the glasshouse, although a cooling system, which came
    into operation at around 27OC, maintained temperatures in the glasshouse below
    30°C for most of the year. At the end of the eight-week wetting period, individuals
    that had germinated were identified and counted. The sediments were then discarded.
    Maximum-minimum thermometers were used to measure air temperatures and water temperatures
    within the tanks, both in the glasshouse and outside. Readings were taken at approximately
    three-day intervals throughout each germination trial. Light measurements were
    recorded at midday at the same intervals with the aid of a Li-Cor (LI-185B) photometer,
    which measures radiation in the 400 to 700 nm waveband.
