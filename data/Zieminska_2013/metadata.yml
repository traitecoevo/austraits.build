  description: Study investigating the anatomical underpinnings of wood density in
    trees and shrubs, by analysing wood components including fibre wall and lumen,
    vessel wall and lumen, and axial and ray parenchyma.
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: Four sites were chosen that spanned a wide range of temperature
    and aridity in eastern Australia. The objective of site selection was to generate
    a broad range of trait values rather than to enable site comparisons. All carried
    natural, undisturbed vegetation growing on oligotrophic soils on flat to slightly
    sloping terrain. Two locations in Tasmania, at 43 deg S, represented low mean
    annual temperature (MAT; 10.6 deg C), and two locations in Queensland near 18
    deg S represented higher MAT (c. 22.5 deg C). Within each latitude, two locations
    were chosen so as to differ markedly in aridity index (AI; Willmott and Feddema
    1992), the ratio of mean annual precipitation (MAP) to potential evapotranspiration
    (PET). In both Queensland and Tasmania the wetter site had an AI c. 1.0 and the
    drier site c. 0.6. MAP, MAT and PET were obtained from GIS (geographic information
    system) layers from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology. At each of the four
    sites, six abundant and phylogenetically distinct woody eudicot species were chosen
    for sampling (species listed in Table 1). One species was sampled at two sites,
    yielding a total of 23 species from eight families. Distal, sun-exposed twigs
    of trees and shrubs were collected from three replicate individuals per species.
    The diameter under bark of twigs varied from 4 mm in plants with little pith to
    10 mm in plants with higher pith content. Consequently the diameter of wood, excluding
    bark and pith, was 4-5 mm. This plant material is referred to here as twigs, although
    in several small shrub species 'twigs' were the main stems. Plant material was
    cut into segments 10-15 cm long and kept wet in sealed plastic bags in the refrigerator
    (4 8C).Wood density was measured within a week from collection; other parts of
    the same twigs were placed in fixative for later measurement of anatomical properties
    (details below).

  trait_name: wood_density

  replicates: 1
  methods: Wood density was measured on segments 3-5 cm long for each twig sample.
    Bark and pith were removed and measurements were carried out on xylem only. In
    this paper we refer to xylem as 'wood'. After removing bark and pith, wood pieces
    were soaked in water for at least 48 h prior to volume measurement. Then a beaker
    filled with water was placed on a balance (0.0001 g, Mettler AE 160). A thin wire
    platform was suspended in water so that it did not touch the side or bottom of
    the beaker. The balance was tared before each measurement and a sample was gently
    placed on the platform. The mass of displaced water was read from the balance.
    From standard water density of 1 g cm-3 and knowing the mass of displaced water,
    we calculated sample volumes applying Archimedes' buoyancy principle (e.g. 1 g
    of displaced water equals 1 cm3 volume). Samples were then placed in paper envelopes
    and dried at 70 deg C for at least 72 h. Wood density was calculated as the dry
    mass divided by water saturated volume (g cm-3).

  methods: To obtain anatomical cross-sections the material was first fixed in formalin-acetic
    acid-alcohol (FAA) for 4 weeks. The FAA was prepared in proportions of 5 to 5
    to 90 (formalin to glacial acetic acid to 70 % ethanol; Gerlach 1972). After 4
    weeks, the fixative was replaced with 70 % ethanol. This 70 % ethanol was then
    replaced two more times within 10 days to further wash the fixative out. Final
    replacement of alcohol was used as a long-term storage medium. Segments for image
    analysis were rehydrated by immersion in 50 % ethanol and after 2-5 days in 30
    % ethanol. Cross-sections were cut with a sledge microtome (Reichert, Vienna,
    Austria) at 10-20 mmthickness using disposable blades (Model A35, Feather Safety
    Razor Co. Ltd, Japan). For better contrast and tissue identification, sections
    were stained with safranin O (Gurr Microscopy Materials, BDH Chemicals Ltd, UK)
    for lignified cell walls (10 min) and with Janus green B (Gurr's, London, UK)
    for cytoplasm (10 min). SafraninO solution used 2 g of stain in 100 mL of distilled
    water (Ruzin 1999) and Janus green B used 0.1 g of stain and 1 mL of glacial acetic
    acid in 100 mL of distilled water (Conn et al. 1960). Sections were rinsed in
    distilled water after each staining session. Afterwards, they were mounted in
    glycerol on a slide, covered with a cover slip and sealed with nail polish. Measurements
    were made onlyon cross-sections, but to assist in interpreting and identifying
    cell types, longitudinal tangential and radial sections and macerations were also
    made. For macerations, small shavings were placed in vials filled with Franklin's
    solution, glacial acetic acid and 6 % hydrogen peroxide in proportions of 1 to
    1 (Franklin 1945). These vials were loosely covered with Parafilm tape and heated
    in the oven at 60 deg C for 1-2 days. Tissues were then rinsed with distilled
    water, stained with safranin O (10 min) and gently squashed onto a microscope
    slide. Microphotographs of cross-sections were taken at x 100 and x 400 magnifications
    using a digital camera (Scion Corporation, CFW-1310C, USA) attached to a light
    microscope (Olympus BX 50F, Olympus Co. Ltd, Japan) and image capturing software
    Scion Visicapture, version 1.4 (Scion Corporation). Two to three images of the
    same area at different focal planes were taken and stacked in Photoshop CS4 (Adobe
    Systems Incorporated, USA). Crosssections were bigger than the field of view;
    therefore, dozens (for x100) or around 10 (for x400) images per cross-section
    were taken and then merged in Photoshop, giving rise to images of whole cross-sections
    at x100 and of one narrow transect at x400. Tissue crosssectional areas and vessel
    traits were measured on one wedge-shaped transect per replicate (x100; Fig. 1)
    and fibre characteristics (x400) on one rectangular transect, both stretching
    frompith to cambium. The radial transects were chosen to be the most representative
    for a section and the tension wood was avoided where possible. The transect borders
    were approximately parallel to the rays and followed middle lamella so that no
    open cells were positioned on the borders. Tissue areas, vessels and fibre walls
    were manually coloured in Photoshop using a Cintiq 21UX graphic tablet (Wacom
    Co., Ltd, Japan). Protoxylem and newly produced xylem were excluded from analysis.
    Larger regions were inspected in species with larger vessels or with more variable
    structure in the tangential direction. The measured area ranged from 0.21 to 0.69
    mm2 for species from cool sites and from 0.31 to 1.9 mm2 for species from hot
    sites. On average, for each image there were 170 vessels measured (+145) of all
    sizes including vessel tails. Fibre, fibre wall and lumen areas were measured
    for an average of 170 fibres per sample (+57) lying in two parallel rows from
    pith to cambium. Colour-coded images were analysed with Image-Pro Plus version
    2.0.0.260 (Media Cybernetics, Inc., USA; Fig. 1). Proportions of all major wood
    cell types (vessel wall and lumen, fibre wall and lumen, axial parenchyma, rays
    and tracheids) and their properties (mean vessel lumen area and mean fibre lumen
    and wall area) were quantified. Here, mean vessel lumen area is also called 'mean
    vessel area' for brevity. Mean vessel area, fibre lumen area and wall area were
    calculated as the arithmetic mean across all relevant cells (vessels or fibres)
    measured within a given radial sector of a sample. In addition to these traits
    we calculated theoretical maximum hydraulic conductivity (called here 'theoretical
    conductivity'; also known as 'potential conductivity'). Conductivity for the lumen
    of each conduit was calculated from the Hagen- Poiseuille expression (pr4)/(8m),
    where r represents mean vessel lumen radius and m represents water dynamic viscosity
    (assuming a standard viscosity value of 1 at 20 deg C). The sum of all vessel
    lumen conductivities per unit cross-section is theoretical conductivity. This
    quantity expresses conductivity variation across species due to conduit diameters,
    but it should be thought of as the theoretical maximum since it does not capture
    effects of end-wall resistances, blockage by tyloses, effects of emboli, etc.

    cell types (vessel wall and lumen, fibre wall and lumen, axial parenchyma, rays
    and tracheids) and their properties (mean vessel lumen area and mean fibre lumen
    and wall area) were quantified. Here, mean vessel lumen area is also called 'mean
    vessel area' for brevity. Mean vessel area, fibre lumen area and wall area were
    calculated as the arithmetic mean across all relevant cells (vessels or fibres)
    measured within a given radial sector of a sample. In addition to these traits
    we calculated theoretical maximum hydraulic conductivity (called here 'theoretical
    conductivity'; also known as 'potential conductivity'). Conductivity for the lumen
    of each conduit was calculated from the Hagen- Poiseuille expression (pr4)/(8m),
    where r represents mean vessel lumen radius and m represents water dynamic viscosity
    (assuming a standard viscosity value of 1 at 20 deg C). The sum of all vessel
    lumen conductivities per unit cross-section is theoretical conductivity. This
    quantity expresses conductivity variation across species due to conduit diameters,
    but it should be thought of as the theoretical maximum since it does not capture
    effects of end-wall resistances, blockage by tyloses, effects of emboli, etc.

  methods: To obtain anatomical cross-sections the material was first fixed in formalin-acetic
    acid-alcohol (FAA) for 4 weeks. The FAA was prepared in proportions of 5 to 5
    to 90 (formalin to glacial acetic acid to 70 % ethanol; Gerlach 1972). After 4
    weeks, the fixative was replaced with 70 % ethanol. This 70 % ethanol was then
    replaced two more times within 10 days to further wash the fixative out. Final
    replacement of alcohol was used as a long-term storage medium. Segments for image
    analysis were rehydrated by immersion in 50 % ethanol and after 2-5 days in 30
    % ethanol. Cross-sections were cut with a sledge microtome (Reichert, Vienna,
    Austria) at 10-20 mmthickness using disposable blades (Model A35, Feather Safety
    Razor Co. Ltd, Japan). For better contrast and tissue identification, sections
    were stained with safranin O (Gurr Microscopy Materials, BDH Chemicals Ltd, UK)
    for lignified cell walls (10 min) and with Janus green B (Gurr's, London, UK)
    for cytoplasm (10 min). SafraninO solution used 2 g of stain in 100 mL of distilled
    water (Ruzin 1999) and Janus green B used 0.1 g of stain and 1 mL of glacial acetic
    acid in 100 mL of distilled water (Conn et al. 1960). Sections were rinsed in
    distilled water after each staining session. Afterwards, they were mounted in
    glycerol on a slide, covered with a cover slip and sealed with nail polish. Measurements
    were made onlyon cross-sections, but to assist in interpreting and identifying
    cell types, longitudinal tangential and radial sections and macerations were also
    made. For macerations, small shavings were placed in vials filled with Franklin's
    solution, glacial acetic acid and 6 % hydrogen peroxide in proportions of 1 to
    1 (Franklin 1945). These vials were loosely covered with Parafilm tape and heated
    in the oven at 60 deg C for 1-2 days. Tissues were then rinsed with distilled
    water, stained with safranin O (10 min) and gently squashed onto a microscope
    slide. Microphotographs of cross-sections were taken at x 100 and x 400 magnifications
    using a digital camera (Scion Corporation, CFW-1310C, USA) attached to a light
    microscope (Olympus BX 50F, Olympus Co. Ltd, Japan) and image capturing software
    Scion Visicapture, version 1.4 (Scion Corporation). Two to three images of the
    same area at different focal planes were taken and stacked in Photoshop CS4 (Adobe
    Systems Incorporated, USA). Crosssections were bigger than the field of view;
    therefore, dozens (for x100) or around 10 (for x400) images per cross-section
    were taken and then merged in Photoshop, giving rise to images of whole cross-sections
    at x100 and of one narrow transect at x400. Tissue crosssectional areas and vessel
    traits were measured on one wedge-shaped transect per replicate (x100; Fig. 1)
    and fibre characteristics (x400) on one rectangular transect, both stretching
    frompith to cambium. The radial transects were chosen to be the most representative
    for a section and the tension wood was avoided where possible. The transect borders
    were approximately parallel to the rays and followed middle lamella so that no
    open cells were positioned on the borders. Tissue areas, vessels and fibre walls
    were manually coloured in Photoshop using a Cintiq 21UX graphic tablet (Wacom
    Co., Ltd, Japan). Protoxylem and newly produced xylem were excluded from analysis.
    Larger regions were inspected in species with larger vessels or with more variable
    structure in the tangential direction. The measured area ranged from 0.21 to 0.69
    mm2 for species from cool sites and from 0.31 to 1.9 mm2 for species from hot
    sites. On average, for each image there were 170 vessels measured (+145) of all
    sizes including vessel tails. Fibre, fibre wall and lumen areas were measured
    for an average of 170 fibres per sample (+57) lying in two parallel rows from
    pith to cambium. Colour-coded images were analysed with Image-Pro Plus version
    2.0.0.260 (Media Cybernetics, Inc., USA; Fig. 1). Proportions of all major wood
    cell types (vessel wall and lumen, fibre wall and lumen, axial parenchyma, rays

    for a section and the tension wood was avoided where possible. The transect borders
    were approximately parallel to the rays and followed middle lamella so that no
    open cells were positioned on the borders. Tissue areas, vessels and fibre walls
    were manually coloured in Photoshop using a Cintiq 21UX graphic tablet (Wacom
    Co., Ltd, Japan). Protoxylem and newly produced xylem were excluded from analysis.
    Larger regions were inspected in species with larger vessels or with more variable
    structure in the tangential direction. The measured area ranged from 0.21 to 0.69
    mm2 for species from cool sites and from 0.31 to 1.9 mm2 for species from hot
    sites. On average, for each image there were 170 vessels measured (+145) of all
    sizes including vessel tails. Fibre, fibre wall and lumen areas were measured
    for an average of 170 fibres per sample (+57) lying in two parallel rows from
    pith to cambium. Colour-coded images were analysed with Image-Pro Plus version
    2.0.0.260 (Media Cybernetics, Inc., USA; Fig. 1). Proportions of all major wood
    cell types (vessel wall and lumen, fibre wall and lumen, axial parenchyma, rays
    and tracheids) and their properties (mean vessel lumen area and mean fibre lumen
    and wall area) were quantified. Here, mean vessel lumen area is also called 'mean
    vessel area' for brevity. Mean vessel area, fibre lumen area and wall area were
    calculated as the arithmetic mean across all relevant cells (vessels or fibres)
    measured within a given radial sector of a sample. In addition to these traits
    we calculated theoretical maximum hydraulic conductivity (called here 'theoretical
    conductivity'; also known as 'potential conductivity'). Conductivity for the lumen
    of each conduit was calculated from the Hagen- Poiseuille expression (pr4)/(8m),
    where r represents mean vessel lumen radius and m represents water dynamic viscosity
    (assuming a standard viscosity value of 1 at 20 deg C). The sum of all vessel
    lumen conductivities per unit cross-section is theoretical conductivity. This
    quantity expresses conductivity variation across species due to conduit diameters,
    but it should be thought of as the theoretical maximum since it does not capture
    effects of end-wall resistances, blockage by tyloses, effects of emboli, etc.
