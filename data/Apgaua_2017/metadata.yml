  description: Study exploring wood functional anatomy traits related to plant hydraulic
    architecture across different plant functional groups in a lowland tropical rain
    forest.
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: Our study site is located at the Daintree Rainforest Observatory
    (16deg06min20secS 145deg26min40secE, 50 m a.s.l.) in a lowland rain forest adjacent
    to the Daintree National Park in north-eastern Australia. The site experiences
    a tropical climate, with mean temperatures of 24 4 deg C and a relatively high
    annual average rainfall of 4900 mm per annum (Bureau of Meteorology 2015). The
    forest type at the site has a wide variety of plant life-forms and a complex vertical
    profile, with canopy heights ranging from 24 to 33 m (Tng et al. 2016). Soils
    are of relatively high fertility, developed over metamorphic and granitic colluvium
    (Bass et al. 2011). ^p  Within this lowland rain forest, we collected samples
    from 90 co-occurring woody plant species belonging to 77 genera and 40 families
    (see Fig. S1 and Table S1, Supporting Information). These commonly occurring species
    within the Daintree Rainforest Observatory represent a broad phylogenetic spread
    across angiosperm lineages. We sampled mature and healthy individuals of 15 species
    as replicates within each of our six woody plant functional groups, according
    to their habit and successional preferences. These groups were as follows, (i)
    mature-phase trees, (ii) understorey trees, (iii) pioneer trees, (iv) understorey
    shrubs, (v) pioneer shrubs and (vi) vines. Our delineation of these discrete groups
    is based on available height and long-term tree demographic data from published
    studies conducted at both the site (Falster & Westoby 2005; Tng et al. 2016) and
    the region (Bradford et al. 2014), and on compiled records of ecological strategy
    (Hyland, Whiffin & Zich 2010; Goosem & Tucker 2013). Trees had different light
    exposure potentials or distribution along a gradient from the forest interior
    to exterior and were therefore delineated into maturephase, understorey or pioneer
    (Richards 1996; Table S1). We defined shrubs as woody plants that attain reproductive
    maturity below six metres height and only rarely exceed this height (Hyland, Whiffin
    & Zich 2010). As with trees, shrubs were segregated into forest understorey or
    pioneers depending on light exposure potentials. Vines refer to liana species
    with woody stem growth. We limited our study to angiosperms because although palms
    and gymnosperms were present at the site, they are not well represented in terms
    of species. ^p  As we aimed to cross-examine woody tissue from species of different
    statures and habits, sampling methods were adjusted to suit different plant functional
    groups. From trees, we collected wood wedges at breast height (1.3 m). For shrubs,
    we sampled destructively, collecting stem sections at the base of the plant from
    5 to 10 cm above the soil level and avoiding basal branches where present. For
    vines, we traced the shoots back to where stems were approximately 1-1.5 cm in
    diameter, and made stem collections of approximately 5 cm length. Fieldwork was
    conducted during the dry seasons (May to August) in 2014 and 2015. As our study
    was designed to test hypotheses about the wood trait distinctiveness of plant
    functional groups, we sampled wood traits in one individual of each of our 90
    study species.

    & Schweingruber 2014), stained the sections with toluidine blue and mounted them
    onto microscope slides with glycerine jelly for examination. We photographed vessels
    from the outermost two centimetres of sapwood of each species with a digital camera
    (Nikon DS-Fi2, Nikon Corporation, Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan) mounted on a light
    microscope (409 and 1009 magnification; Nikon ECLIPSE Ci-L, Nikon Corporation).
    Using the imaging software GIMP (v2.8.10, https://www.gimp.org/), we coloured
    60-100 vessel lumens from at least three images per species. We used the imaging
    software IMAGEJ (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA) to count and
    measure vessel lumen areas (VA; lm2) from the coloured vessel lumens and obtained
    vessel density (VD) by counting and measuring the area of all vessel lumens that
    fell within three digital square frames of a standardized area. Vessel fraction
    (VF) was calculated as the product of vessel area and VD (VA 9 VD). For greater
    interstudy comparability, we calculated vessel diameters from vessel areas, and
    from these, we obtained mean (d; lm) and maximum diameters (dmax) for each species.

    Additionally, we calculated the hydraulically weighted diameter (dh) of each species,
    using the equation, (sum(d^4/N)^0.25, where N is the number of vessels (Tyree
    & Zimmermann 2002). This measure denotes the mean diameter that vessels need to
    be if it is to have the same total conductivity for the same number of conduits
    as the sampled stem.

    (VF) was calculated as the product of vessel area and VD (VA 9 VD). We used the
    Hagen-Poiseuille equation to calculate the theoretical specific xylem hydraulic
    conductivity (Ks; kg s-1 MPa-1) per unit of cross-sectional area (henceforth theoretical
    conductivity) as, Ks = pi*sum(d^4)/128*n*A[cross-sectional area], where n is the
    viscosity (1.002x10^9MPa s-1; Tyree & Zimmermann 2002). (Note, these units are
    different from those reported in the manuscript. Other studies in AusTraits have
    used the same formula to calculate these values, but then adjusted them to be
    comparable to Ks (not theoretical), and the same was done to merge this dataset
    into AusTraits; that is, the units used are '10^6 x kg/m/s/MPa' versus 'kg/s/MPa'
    in the manuscript.)

    (VF) was calculated as the product of vessel area and VD (VA 9 VD). Finally, as
    vessel clustering may enhance hydraulic efficiency, we calculated a vessel grouping
    index, the vessel multiple fraction (Vmf), which is the number of groups of vessels
    (i.e. vessels in direct contact with one another) divided by the total number
    of vessels (Scholz et al. 2013). A Vmf value approximating 1 denotes a tendency
    towards solitary vessels.
- var_in: Intrinsic water-use efficiency (umol mol-1 )

  trait_name: water_use_efficiency_intrinsic
  entity_type: individual
  value_type: raw
  basis_of_value: measurement
  replicates: 1
  methods: We measured carbon isotope ratios (d13C) from leaf samples, which were
    processed and analysed at the School of Plant Biology, University of Western Australia.
    Intrinsic water-use efficiency (WUEi; umol mol-1) of each species was then obtained
    using a standard algorithm provided by Werner et al. (2012), which calculates
    WUEi from user-supplied source air CO2 concentrations and the d13C values (& based
    on the Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite standard for expressing carbon isotope ratios)
    of leaf samples and source air CO2. Previous studies recommend correcting WUEi
    estimates from leaf carbon isotope content with the contribution of the carbon
    isotope composition of respired CO2 in closed-canopy forests (Sternberg, Mulkey
    & Wright 1989). We therefore collected data on CO2 concentrations and isotopic
    composition through the forest canopy using a custom-built sampling manifold.
    Continuous monitoring with a Picarro G2131-i Analyzer (Picarro Inc., Santa Clara,
    CA, USA) allowed us to obtain the average daily (06.00-18.00 h) CO2 concentrations
    as well their d13C values at 0.5, 1.5, 3, 22 and 44 m for a month during the 2014
    dry season (Table S2). Depending on the canopy height positions or light exposure
    of individual species, we used corresponding CO2 concentrations and d13C values
    in the algorithm. We used the CO2 concentrations and their d13C values at the
    44-m collection point for vines, maturephase trees, and pioneer trees and shrubs;
    at 22 m for understorey trees; and at 1_5 m for understorey shrubs. As d13C values
    were strongly correlated with WUEi (Pearson correlation, r = 0_847, P < 0_0001),
    we use only the latter in our analyses.
