  description: Study investigating how mechanical strength, assessed as the modulus
    of elasticity (MOE) and the modulus of rupture (MOR), and density relate to the
    anatomical characteristics of intact mangrove branches from southeast Queensland
    and whether the mechanical strength of branches varies among mangrove species.
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: Site description and sample collection ^p Our study sites were
    located in southeast Queensland, where the mean air temperature is 21°C (a mean
    minimum temperature of 15°C and a mean maximum temperature of 25°C) and the mean
    rainfall is 1150 mm year-1. Our study sites were in the Tinchi Tamba Wetlands
    Reserve (27.23°S, 153.02°E) and the Point Halloran Reserve (27.56°S, 153.28°E),
    35 km to the south of the Tinchi Tamba site. These sites were chosen because they
    contain five of the most abundant mangrove species in southeast Queensland (Table
    1). ^p At each site and on the basis of elevation relative to mean sea level,
    we defined two intertidal zone habitats, low and high intertidal. We assessed
    the salinity of soil pore water at each intertidal zone from each site. We collected
    pore water samples at 30 cm depth using a suction device (McKee et al. 1988) and
    analysed them with a handheld refractometer (W/ATC 300011, SPER Scientific, Scottsdale,
    AZ, USA). ^p We collected canopy branches from each species in each intertidal
    zone (low and high intertidal) during July 2010; see sample sizes and details
    of collection dates in Table 1. We tested for differences between species in mechanical
    strength (modulus of elasticity (MOE) and modulus of rupture (MOR)) and the density
    of intact branches as described in the data analyses section. We made a second
    collection of branches to assess the relationship between mechanical strength,
    the density of intact branches and anatomical characteristics( see details in
    Table 1). ^p We chose straight branches with diameters of 8-10 mm and lengths
    that were 20 times larger than branch diameter to minimise shear during the measurements
    (Onoda et al. 2010). After cutting the branches, we covered them with a moist
    paper towel and stored them in sealed plastic bags inside an insulated container.
    Branches were then stored in a refrigerator at 8°C until laboratory analyses of
    mechanical strength were performed (within 2 days of sample collection). After
    analysis of the mechanical properties of the branches, we stored two subsamples
    of each sample (~7 cm length each) for assessment of the density of intact branches
    and anatomical characteristics. For anatomical characteristics, we analysed xylem
    characteristics (fibre wall thickness and xylem vessel diameter; for A. marina,
    we also assessed the proportion of phloem per layer of wood as described in Santini
    et al. 2012) and branch characteristics (the proportion of branch diameter that
    comprised pith and bark).

  notes: Some species were collected at both sites, but currently we only have metapopulation
    means and the values have been assigned to the Point Halloran Reserve site even
    if the species grows at both sites.

  methods: To assess the anatomical characteristics of the xylem, we made transverse
    sections of 25 um thickness with a Reichert-Jung sliding microtome (Reichert-Jung,
    Heidelburg, Germany). We photographed the sections using a BX61 microscope (Olympus,
    Tokyo, Japan). From the photographs, we measured 100-200 xylem vessels and 100-200
    fibres for each stem. Fibre wall thickness was calculated as double fibre wall
    thickness dividing the total distance by two.

    fibres for each stem. We calculated the total vessel lumen area (XA) considering
    the vessel area (VA) and the vessel density (VD), following Lewis (1992), where
    a and b are the short and the long axes of each vessel (see manuscript for equations).

  methods: We measured the density of intact branches from the 7 cm long subsamples
    of the collected branches (van Gelder et al. 2006; Onoda et al. 2010). We determined
    the mass of water displaced by the green volume of the intact branches, then dried
    the subsamples in an oven at 60°C for 5 days (until constant weight was attained).
    Finally, we calculated the density of intact branches as the ratio of dry mass
    over green volume following Chave et al. (2006).

  methods: We measured the MOR and the MOE of the intact branches using an electromechanical
    testing machine (INSTRON 5584, Chicago, IL, USA). The mechanical properties of
    branches can be described by measuring their MOR and their MOE. The MOE indicates
    how much a branch can bend and it is defined as the slope of the linear elastic
    region of load (F) in N and deflection (d) in mm. For each branch, we performed
    a three-point bending test. For this test, a vertical force was applied at 25
    mm min -1. A representation of the three-point bending test can be found in the
    supplementary online material (Fig. S1, available as Supplementary Material to
    this paper). In addition, in order to facilitate comparison with other studies
    in the literature (e.g. Jacobsen et al. 2007; Pratt et al. 2007), equations to
    calculate the MOE of xylem tissue (i.e. branches excluding the contributions from
    pith and bark) are also available in the supplementary online material (Methods
    section) (see manuscript for equations).

  methods: We measured the MOR and the MOE of the intact branches using an electromechanical
    testing machine (INSTRON 5584, Chicago, IL, USA). The mechanical properties of
    branches can be described by measuring their MOR and their MOE. The MOR measures
    the maximum load that branches can resist, depending on their circular cross-sectional
    area (Gere and Goodno 2009) (see manuscript for equations).
