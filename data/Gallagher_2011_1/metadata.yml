  description: genome size data from Jan Suda for acacia
  basis_of_record: field, lab
  life_stage: adult, seedling
  sampling_strategy: 'Species selection We initially compiled a list of 145 Australian
    Acacia species that have been introduced outside their native range. This list
    was generated by combining data on Australian acacias from four sources: (1) all
    species that are present in South African Herbaria (H. Glen, pers. comm.), (2)
    all species listed in the Global Compendium of Weeds (Randall, 2007), (3) all
    species introduced to two or more regions throughout the world as presented in
    Castro-Diez et al. (2011) and (4) all species listed as invasive in Richardson
    et al. (2011) (see Appendix S1 in Richardson et al. 2011 for a database of sources).
    Analyses were performed on a subset of 92 Acacia species for which genome size
    data were available. Species were categorized as either invasive (21 species)
    or non-invasive (71 species), based on Richardson & Rejmanek (2011) (see Appendix
    S1 in Supporting Information). Richardson & Rejmanek (2011) define 23 Australia
    acacias as invasive, but we were unable to obtain reliable genome size estimates
    for A. holosericea A. Cunn. ex G. Don and A. saligna (Labill.) H.L. Wendl. and
    omitted these species from this study.'

  methods: We follow the genome size nomenclature presented by Greilhuber et al. (2005).
    We use the term 'genome size' and 'holoploid genome size' interchangeably throughout
    to denote 'holoploid genome size' (expressed in 2C-values), which specifically
    refer to measurements of DNA content of the whole chromosome complement irrespective
    of the ploidy level. Although the majority of acacias are likely to be diploid
    (2n = 26), other ploidy levels have previously been reported (see Plant DNA C-values
    Database http://data.kew.org/cvalues/). All genome size measurements were made
    within a single laboratory using standardized protocols, which significantly reduces
    the likelihood of measurement error influencing results. Holoploid genome sizes
    were determined for fresh field-collected leaf tissue by propidium iodide flow
    cytometry using Partec CyFlow SL instrument (Partec GmbH, Munster, Germany) equipped
    with green diode-pumped solid-state laser (532 nm, 100 mW power output; Cobolt
    Samba, Solna, Sweden). Sample preparation followed a simplified two-step protocol
    using Otto I + II buffers as described by Dolezel et al. (2007). Bellis perennis
    (2C = 3.38 pg; Schonswetter et al., 2007) was selected as an appropriate internal
    reference standard (with genome size close to but not overlapping with that of
    acacia samples). Fluorescence intensity of 5000 particles was recorded in each
    acquisition. Only histograms with peaks of approximately the same height and coefficients
    of variation below 5% were considered. Each plant was reanalysed at least three
    times on different days to minimize potential random instrumental drift. If between-day
    variation (max/min value) exceeded 2%, the outlying value was discarded and the
    sample remeasured.
