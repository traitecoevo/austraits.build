  description: A collection of leaf d13C values for plant communities across Queensland
    to understand how rainfall affects carbon isotope discrimination
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: Plant specimens were collected from 12 sites along a rainfall
    gradient in southern Queensland, of approximately 900 km in length, at an approximate
    latitude of 27deg s. The location and dominant plant community of each site are
    listed in Table 1. Sites were selected in order to cover a wide range of plant
    communities (Acacia dominated communities in the west to rainforest communities
    in the east) and rainfall. At each site, recently produced leaf material was collected
    from a range of species characteristic of each community. Woody vines and herbaceous
    species were omitted from collections. In forest communities, leaves were sampled
    only from exposed sunlit crown units. The number of species included in each collection
    varied from 12 at Coominya to 57 at Pine Mountain. In total, 348 plant species
    were sampled for analysis.
  original_file: DELTA-C, COOMIN-C.xls (delta 13C for Coomina, but just 1 value per
    species), DELTA-GA.xls (raw d13C values for Gambubal), IDALIA (raw d13C values
    for Idalia), LHDELTAC.xls (raw d13C values for Longholme) from Ian Wright's archives,
    together with data compiled by Anna Richards. The raw data files were manually
    manipulated in Excel to craete a single row of data.
  notes: This dataset does not include data for all the sites listed in the manuscript.
    AusTraits has been unable to obtain a complete dataset; the additional site data
    are in the file in the raw data folder. Also, the plant growth form column starts
    to contain a number of nonsensical values beyond row 94 and these have been filtered
    out (E. Wenk, 2022-05-31)

  methods: Leaf samples for each species (n = 3-12) were oven-dried at 70deg C and
    ground to a fine powder in a vibratory ball mill (Retsch MM - 2, Haan, Germany).
    The carbon isotope ratio, relative to the PDB standard, was determined using an
    automated 15N/13C analysermass spectrometer (ANCA-MS, Europa Scientific, Crewe,
    UK), in which a Tracermass stable isotope analyser was connected to a Roboprep-CN
    biological sample converter. Precision of this instrument based on the multiple
    analysis of a beet sugar standard is in the order of +/-0.062 SD.
