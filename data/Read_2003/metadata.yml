  description: Measurements of a wide range of mechanical properties across a diverse
    range of species and leaf forms, including highly scleromorphic leaves, and compared
    these with sclerophylly indices to determine the mechanical properties of sclerophylls.
  collection_type: arboretum
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: Leaves were collected in October-November 2000 from the Royal
    Botanic Gardens, Melbourne, Australia (37.8 deg S, 145.0 deg E). The climate of
    Melbourne is relatively mild, with a mean daily maximum and minimum temperature
    of 19.8 deg C and 10.1 deg C, respectively, and annual rainfall of c . 660 mm
    (Commonwealth Bureau of Meteorology). The rainfall is more uniformly distributed
    through the year in Melbourne than in much of southern Australia. SAMPLING PROCEDURE
    Thirty-two dicot families containing evergreen species were selected randomly
    (by random number tables) from those represented in the Gardens. Within each family,
    the list of species was reduced to those with at least five plants present. A
    single species was chosen randomly (using random number tables) from each family
    (Table 2). Although the plants are native to a variety of regions, Australia is
    strongly represented (Table 2). Banksia marginata was added for comparison because
    it was among the toughest and strongest species recorded by Edwards et al . (2000),
    but was not used in any statistical analyses. It was not growing at the Gardens
    and was instead collected from the grounds of Monash University (16 km south-east).
    Where possible, five plants of each species were chosen haphazardly from locations
    across the Gardens, but in a small number of species a lesser number of plants
    was sampled, due to prior death. Leaves were collected from sunlit branches and
    within 1-2 m of ground level where possible. However, the growth form of the plants
    ranged from herbs to tall trees (Table 2), and plants were located in various
    parts of the Gardens, and hence were undoubtedly exposed to some variation in
    microclimate and soil properties. Only leaves that expanded during the previous
    growing season (therefore 6- to 12-months-old) were collected. Leaves were investigated
    over an 8-week period. Leaves from one plant of each of c. 10 species were harvested
    per collection batch, and mechanical and morphological measurements were undertaken
    over a 48-h period. Species were haphazardly allocated to a collection batch,
    and batches were harvested twice per week until there were five replicates for
    each species. Batches were systematically alternated across the 8-week period
    to minimize any potential seasonal effect. Collected leaves were sprayed with
    water and sealed in a plastic bag with moist tissue in an insulated container.
    From each collection, leaves were haphazardly taken for measurement of biomechanics,
    leaf morphology, and for later anatomical study.

  methods: LEAF BIOMECHANICAL PROPERTIES Tests were undertaken within 48 h of collection
    on haphazardly chosen leaves from each replicate plant. A Universal Testing Machine
    (Chatillon Universal Tension and Compression Tester, model UTSE-2, AMETEK Inc.,
    Paoli, PA, USA) was modified to produce a data output of 800 points per second
    of the instantaneous force and displacement to a personal computer. Fracture tests
    (punching, tearing and shearing) and bending tests were undertaken and the mechanical
    properties (Table 1) were derived from force-displacement curves using Leaf2k
    ver. 3.7 (M. Logan, Monash University). We used work to fracture as a measure
    of toughness, where fracture toughness is defined as the resistance of a given
    material to the propagation of a crack (Wainwright et al., 1976). Work to fracture,
    fundamentally an energetic process (Atkins & Mai, 1985), can be estimated from
    the area under the force displacement curve, provided the curve returns to zero
    stress in a series of relatively controlled steps, rather than in a single massive
    drop (Vincent, 1992). We use work to punch and work to shear as estimates of leaf
    toughness, even though the former may overestimate the true toughness of the specimen
    (Sanson et al., 2001). The concept of strength is complex, strength has been considered
    variously as the yield stress (the change from elastic to plastic flow in a stressed
    material), the stress at fracture, or the maximum resistance to an applied force
    (Wainwright et al., 1976). We have been unable to consistently detect the yield
    stress or stress at fracture, and therefore measured strength in this study as
    the maximum force recorded divided by the area over which the force was applied.
    In materials engineering, where the usual interest is in the property of the material
    in test situations, it is conventional to normalize strength and toughness by
    dividing by appropriate dimensions (including thickness) of the test piece. Such
    properties may be seen as 'material' properties. However, properties normalized
    to thickness, ignore the contribution of thickness to the mechanical properties
    of the leaf. Consequently we present both 'structural' properties (normalized
    to width of the test piece, but not thickness) and 'material' properties (i.e.
    normalized to both width and thickness and which we term 'specific', following
    the term 'specific work of fracture' used by Atkins & Mai, 1985), where 'material'
    (normalized) properties reflect an average of a very heterogeneous structure rather
    than material properties as more often measured by engineers in isotropic materials.
    Further aspects of these tests have been discussed by Aranwela et al. (1999) and
    Sanson et al. (2001).   BENDING TESTS The flexural Young modulus (E ) and flexural
    stiffness (EI, where I is the second moment of area) were measured in a three-point
    bending test ( Jackson, 1992) (Table 1). The tests were undertaken on lamina strips
    that excluded the midrib and leaf margins, and also on whole leaves. A 5-mm wide
    strip of leaf was cut from one side of the leaf, parallel to the midrib. A pilot
    study was first undertaken to estimate the optimal span to thickness ratio (S/T)
    to minimize significant shear deformation, following Jackson (1992). In retrospect,
    four-point bending would have been preferable, since shear deformation is excluded
    ( Jackson, 1992). A ratio of 50-70 times the strip thickness appeared suitable
    for most species. A ratio of 50 was the maximum possible for Ligustrum japonicum
    and Agapetes meiniana, and it is not certain whether E was maximum and constant
    at that ratio in these species. Therefore, it is possible that E and EI are underestimated
    in these two species. The test protocol followed Jackson (1992), except that machine
    stiffness was not measured (we assumed that the forces encountered were negligible
    compared with machine stiffness). Thickness was measured in the centre of the
    test strip using a digital micrometer and the optimal span was calculated. The
    test strip was placed centrally over the two lower supports that were positioned
    to create the optimal span, standardized at 70x strip thickness where possible.
    The crosshead was positioned so that the upper support was almost touching the
    test strip. The cross-head was then activated to push the upper support onto the
    test strip at 0.3 mm s-1 until a sufficiently long trace was obtained. The initial
    slope of the force displacement curve (apparent stiffness, F/Dapp) was measured,
    ignoring any toe region. For a small number of narrow-leaved species, the strip
    width was less than 5 mm, and so EI was expressed per unit strip width (EIW) for
    all species.

    Further aspects of these tests have been discussed by Aranwela et al. (1999) and
    Sanson et al. (2001).   TEARING TESTS A longitudinal strip of lamina 41 x 4.5
    mm was cut from the middle of the left-hand-side of each leaf, where large enough,
    such that the length was greater than eight times the width to counter the effects
    of necking (Vincent, 1990). Test strips were secured in the force-tester by gluing
    each end of the strip with cyanoacrylate glue into the slot of a brass cheesehead
    screw. The strips were notched on the left-hand side (0.5 mm length) to direct
    the position of fracture so the test strip did not break at the secured ends.
    Any effect of notch sensitivity (Vincent, 1990; Lucas et al., 1991) was minimized
    by standardizing the relative notch length. The fracture length was measured by
    calipers and lamina thickness was measured as for the punch test, to estimate
    the cross-sectional area of the fracture surface, corrected for the area of the
    initial notch. It was impossible to obtain the recommended aspect ratio from lamina
    tissue alone in two small- and narrow-leaved species (Leucopogon parviflorus and
    Pancheria elegans) and therefore the test strips of these species comprised the
    full width of the leaf.

    edge was horizontal in the lower blade and 20deg in the upper blade, providing
    a constant approach angle of 20deg. The bottom horizontal blade moved at a displacement
    speed set at 0.3 mm s-1, shearing the test leaf into two parts. The upper blade
    was raked at 45deg and the bottom blade was not raked but was inclined to provide
    a relief angle of 4deg. A blank run of the blades was undertaken before every
    test to record background friction and was subtracted from the test force-displacement
    curve. A transverse cut was made across the leaf, at a random distance along the
    leaf (distance selected by random number tables) ignoring the first and last 10%
    of the leaf (base and tip). The width and surface area of the leaf at the shearing
    plane was measured by image analysis, allowing work to be expressed per unit leaf
    width and per cross-sectional area (Table 1). Calculations of mechanical properties
    were made both over the full width of the leaf, and from one side of the leaf,
    excluding the midrib and the margin.

    considered variously as the yield stress (the change from elastic to plastic flow
    in a stressed material), the stress at fracture, or the maximum resistance to
    an applied force (Wainwright et al., 1976). We have been unable to consistently
    detect the yield stress or stress at fracture, and therefore measured strength
    in this study as the maximum force recorded divided by the area over which the
    force was applied. In materials engineering, where the usual interest is in the
    property of the material in test situations, it is conventional to normalize strength
    and toughness by dividing by appropriate dimensions (including thickness) of the
    test piece. Such properties may be seen as 'material' properties. However, properties
    normalized to thickness, ignore the contribution of thickness to the mechanical
    properties of the leaf. Consequently we present both 'structural' properties (normalized
    to width of the test piece, but not thickness) and 'material' properties (i.e.
    normalized to both width and thickness and which we term 'specific', following
    the term 'specific work of fracture' used by Atkins & Mai, 1985), where 'material'
    (normalized) properties reflect an average of a very heterogeneous structure rather
    than material properties as more often measured by engineers in isotropic materials.
    Further aspects of these tests have been discussed by Aranwela et al. (1999) and
    Sanson et al. (2001). PUNCH TESTS In this test a hole is punched through the leaf
    lamina, with the resistance to penetration suggested to be a combination of shear
    and compressive strength and resistance to crack propagation (Vincent, 1992).
    A die was mounted onto the moving head of the test machine so that it engaged
    a hardened steel, flat-ended, sharp-edged cylindrical punch of 0.5-mm diameter
    with a clearance of 0.05 mm and a displacement speed of 0.3 mm s-1. Holes were
    punched at 10 random positions across the leaf, noting the tissue-type punched.
    Extra holes were punched as necessary to achieve five randomly positioned punches
    of each of intercostal lamina (lamina between secondary veins), secondary veins
    and midrib. For Leucopogon parviflorus, with closely spaced secondary veins, the
    'intercostal' punches would probably include secondary veins for at least some
    punches. The punch was wider than many secondary veins across species and in those
    cases underestimates the mechanical properties of the veins. Lamina thickness
    was measured using a digital micrometer. Leaf strength and toughness were derived
    from the force-displacement curve (Table 1).

    (punching, tearing and shearing) and bending tests were undertaken and the mechanical
    properties (Table 1) were derived from force-displacement curves using Leaf2k
    ver. 3.7 (M. Logan, Monash University). We used work to fracture as a measure
    of toughness, where fracture toughness is defined as the resistance of a given
    material to the propagation of a crack (Wainwright et al., 1976). Work to fracture,
    fundamentally an energetic process (Atkins & Mai, 1985), can be estimated from
    the area under the force displacement curve, provided the curve returns to zero
    stress in a series of relatively controlled steps, rather than in a single massive
    drop (Vincent, 1992). We use work to punch and work to shear as estimates of leaf
    toughness, even though the former may overestimate the true toughness of the specimen

    mm was cut from the middle of the left-hand-side of each leaf, where large enough,
    such that the length was greater than eight times the width to counter the effects
    of necking (Vincent, 1990). Test strips were secured in the force-tester by gluing
    each end of the strip with cyanoacrylate glue into the slot of a brass cheesehead
    screw. The strips were notched on the left-hand side (0.5 mm length) to direct
    the position of fracture so the test strip did not break at the secured ends.
    Any effect of notch sensitivity (Vincent, 1990; Lucas et al., 1991) was minimized
    by standardizing the relative notch length. The fracture length was measured by
    calipers and lamina thickness was measured as for the punch test, to estimate
    the cross-sectional area of the fracture surface, corrected for the area of the
    initial notch. It was impossible to obtain the recommended aspect ratio from lamina
    tissue alone in two small- and narrow-leaved species (Leucopogon parviflorus and
    Pancheria elegans) and therefore the test strips of these species comprised the
    full width of the leaf.
