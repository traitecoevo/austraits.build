  description: An experiment to assess how seed provenance and simulated warming affect
    the growth and physiology of seedlings of the alpine herb Aciphylla glacialis
  collection_type: field_experiment
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: Study species and study sites Aciphylla glacialis (F.Muell.)
    Benth (Apiaceae) is a common perennial, dioecious, Australian alpine herb found
    primarily in grassy herbfields above the treeline (1800-2228 m a.s.l.) (Costin
    et al. 2000). Individuals often form clumps in the field, with individuals around
    30-70 cm in height when flowering. The species is easy to recognise and propagate,
    and thus was selected as a good representative of the broader flora of perennial
    forbs in grassy herbfields, which is the dominant vegetation type in this alpine
    region. Aciphylla glacialis seeds were collected in Autumn 2012 from Kosciuszko
    National Park from four populations that were chosen to reflect differences in
    thermal regimes, arising due to differences in elevation and snow duration patterns
    during the seed formation period (January-April 2012) (Briceno 2014; Supplementary
    Material table S1 available at the journal's website). These collections are hereafter
    referred to as provenances and called, Charlotte Pass (1842 m), Snowy River (1972
    m), Seamans Hut (2030 m) and Kosciuszko Summit (2225 m). In brief, the summer-time
    conditions of the two lower elevation sites, Charlotte Pass and Snowy River, had
    greater temperature ranges and longer growing seasons than the two higher elevation
    sites. Specifically, Charlotte Pass was characterised by higher mean and maximum
    temperatures, frequent high temperature events, and a relatively longer growing
    season (based on growing degree-days), whereas Snowy River had the greatest frequency
    of frosts, and also more severe frost events, as well as lower minimum temperatures.
    The higher elevation sites, Seamans Hut and Kosciuszko Summit, were exposed to
    a narrower thermal range, both within days and across seasons and generally shorter
    growing seasons. A prolonged snow pack presence at Seamans Hut resulted in fewer
    growing degree-days than at Kosciuszko Summit (Briceno 2014; table S1). Seed collection
    and germination Seeds were collected at the stage of natural dispersal from 10
    mature plants of a similar size for each provenance (hereafter designated as maternal
    lines). Plants were at least 3 m apart. Collected seeds from each maternal line
    (plant) were kept separate, cleaned and stored in a seed-drying room at ~15% relative
    humidity before cold stratification. Seeds were sown into 9-cm Petri dishes containing
    1% agar. Germination in A. glacialis occurs after exposure to winter conditions
    (Briceno 2014; Hoyle et al. 2014). Therefore,wealleviated morphological and physiological
    dormancy by exposing seeds to conditions that mimicked the natural progression
    of post-dispersal temperatures through summer, early autumn, late autumn and winter.
    Following germination, seeds were transferred to 68mm square pots with native
    planting mix (Martins Fertilizers, Yass, NSW) and Yates Nutricote grey pellets
    (16 to 4.4 to 8.3, N/P/K) fertiliser (Briceno 2014). Seedlings were then left
    to grow in a glasshouse for 2 years under warm summer alpine conditions 25/15_C
    day/night temperature regime until they had four true leaves and were ~25 mm in
    height and so large enough to establish and survive transplant into the field.
    By allowing the seedlings to establish under controlled conditions we sought to
    minimise the potential for maternal provisioning effects to be expressed as differences
    among provenances. As these small plants were pre-reproductive and still would
    not flower for several years, we refer to them as seedlings throughout, and each
    seedling was allocated a unique individual plant identification (ID). Open top
    chamber field trial In early autumn (March 2014), seedlings were transplanted
    into the field at Kosciuszko National Park, near Merritt's Creek (1950 m above
    sea level, -36.462431, 148.305765). Small polycarbonate open top chambers (OTC)
    were used to simulate climate warming (Cochrane et al. 2015). Chambers were circular
    with a 45 cm basal diameter, 32 cm opening diameter, and 15 cm central height.
    The experimental design consisted of five blocks, each composed of 10 plots (Supplementary
    Material fig. S1). A plot included one open top chamber and one equivalently sized
    ambient control subplot (five blocks by 10 plots by two subplots (one per treatment)
    = 100 subplots; 50 OTC and 50 ambient). Within each OTC or paired ambient subplot,
    four individual A. glacialis seedlings were planted, one per provenance. Maternal
    lines were randomised within each provenance using a stratified design across
    blocks, plots and subplots. Within each OTC or ambient subplot, seedlings with
    intact glasshouse soil were randomly planted at the cardinal directions. At planting
    each seedling was well watered. Seedlings were located ~15 cm away from one another,
    and encroaching vegetation was removed at each visit. Paired subplots were orientated
    in east/west pairings and separated from adjacent subplots by at least one meter.
    Plots as a whole were arranged in a generally north/south orientation, though
    positions and orientations were modified as dictated by the topography (e.g. large
    rocks or dense existing vegetation). We controlled as best as possible for constant
    slope and aspect across blocks and plots. Field measurements Seedling survival,
    growth and photosynthetic efficiency were assessed up to 11 times during the growing
    seasons between March 2014 and April 2016. Growth was measured as the height of
    the plant with the longest leaf extended (mm). We also counted the number of fully
    expanded leaves.

  methods: In late April 2016 all surviving seedlings were harvested to assess biomass
    allocation and specific leaf area (SLA). Seedlings were carefully excavated and
    all loose dirt shaken from root systems. Plants were stored in resealable plastic
    bags with damp paper towel and transported back to the laboratory in Canberra.
    Seedlings were separated into above- and belowground components. Roots were washed
    to remove any fine soil particles. Leaf size (cm2) of the three largest leaves
    for each individual was determined using a flatbed scanner and analysed using
    ImageJ (Schneider et al. 2012). Above- and below-ground biomass and leaf area
    samples were then ovendried for 72 h at 60 deg C and then weighed using an analytical
    balance (Mettler-Toledo, Greifensee, Switzerland). SLA was calculated as the total
    leaf area (cm2)/mass (g) for the three scanned leaves (Perez-Harguindeguy et al.
    2013).

  methods: ice_nucleation_temperature; Freezing resistance was assessed as the temperature
    at which intra-cellular ice formation occurs in leaves (Taschler and Neuner 2004).
    These measurements were conducted in late summer/early autumn just over 1 year
    after planting (14-15 April 2015) and followed the protocol of Briceno et al.
    (2014). Seedlings were considered too small for measurements in thefirst spring
    (2014). For each treatment, leaf tissue was sampled from five plants per treatment
    per provenance, giving a total of 40 samples (two treatments by four provenances
    by five replicates = 40). Due to high mortality during the previous summer, there
    was insufficient replication to entirely balance blocks or maternal lines within
    sites. As each treatment and provenance was represented in the freezing assay,
    the removal of a single blade was determined unlikely to have biased any comparisons
    made at the final harvest. The largest healthy leaf from each plant was collected
    in the field and kept damp at a temperature of 2-4 deg C in the dark during transportation
    back to the laboratory in Canberra for use within the next 10-48 h, depending
    upon whether the leaf was included in the first or second run of the freezing
    assay. Leaves were trimmed to a standard size of 2 cm length before each sample
    was placed into an individual chamber in an insulated polystyrene box connected
    to a water bath (JULABO Labortechnik, Seelbach, Germany). Temperature within the
    insulated box was reduced from 20 deg C to -25 deg C at a rate of 2 deg C per
    20 min following Briceno et al. (2014). Temperatures for each leaf sample were
    recorded at 1 s intervals using copper-constant thermocouples and a Datataker
    DT500 (Biolab Australia Pty Ltd, trading as Datataker, Scoresby, Vic.). The point
    of freezing was indicated by detecting an exotherm, or sudden rise in leaf temperature,
    which is a result of the heat produced through the intracellular freezing process.
    Nucleation temperature was defined as the lowest temperature reached before the
    occurrence of the exothermic reaction. The insulated box held 20 samples, so the
    40 samples were randomly allocated to each of two runs in a structured random
    design so that each run contained an equal representation of treatments and sites.
