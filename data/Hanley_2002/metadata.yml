  description: A study that quantified several chemical and physical properties, usually
    considered to affect seedling palatability, of 14 Western Australian Hakea species
    and explored whether seedling defences were related to other plant life-history
    attributes.
  basis_of_record: lab

  sampling_strategy: SPECIES SELECTION AND COLLECTION OF PLANT MATERIAL The genus
    Hakea accounts for over 100 species in a total south-western Australian flora
    of 6000 species (Paczkowska & Chapman 2000). The seeds are enriched with nitrogen
    and phosphorus such that seedlings make little use of soil nutrients in the first
    few months of growth (Stock, Pate & Delfs 1990). Herbivory is a significant factor
    affecting recruitment of Hakea seedlings (Hanley & Lamont 2001; Lamont & Groom
    1998), and there is considerable variation in their leaf morphology, and degree
    of physical defence (spinescence). Many species (e.g. Hakea erinacea) possess
    needle-shaped (terete) leaves with sharp, terminal spines. Others have broad,
    flat leaves that develop numerous marginal spines (Hakea oleifolia). Some broad-leaved
    species, in contrast, possess only small terminal calluses on their leaves (Hakea
    elliptica) and appear to lack physical defences (Groom, Lamont & Markey 1997).
    The study species were selected because they are well represented in the region,
    seeds were readily procurable, and they covered the full range of leaf variations
    in Hakea; seven were broad-leaved and seven needle-leaved, with different amounts
    of spinescence in each (Groom et al. 1997). Although the geographical ranges of
    the individual species vary, each broad-leaved species occurs with at least one
    of the needle-leaved species. Fruits (follicles) of Hakea erinacea, H. lissocarpha,
    H. petiolaris, H. stenocarpa, H. trifurcata and H. undulata were collected in
    March 1999 from sites around Lesmurdie, on the Darling Scarp, 20 km east of Perth
    (31"57'S, 115"51'E). To extract the seeds, follicles were placed in direct sunlight
    and dried until the seeds fell out. Seeds of the remaining eight species were
    supplied from commercial sources. All had been collected from sites in south-western
    Australia during the previous 10 months. Nomenclature follows McCarthy (1999).
    SEED MASS AND RELATIVE GROWTH RATE Mean seed mass for each species was determined
    by weighing 50 seeds of each species. Seeds were germinated in Petri dishes in
    a dark incubator set at 15ºC. Following germination, seedlings were transferred
    to 50 mm diameter pots containing a 4 to 1 (by volume) quartzitic sand to peat
    compost mixture. This mix accurately reflects the texture and low nutrient status
    of soils in this region (Lamont 1995). Nutrient enrichments are likely to reduce
    growth rates, or even cause seedling death (Milberg, Perez-Fernandez & Lamont
    1998), so this potting medium was considered to represent near-optimum soil nutrient
    conditions for hakeas. Two seedlings of each species were planted into each of
    16 pots, while four seedlings were planted into each of eight pots for the first
    harvest. These pots were randomly arranged on large trays placed inside an illuminated
    incubator (900 ,tmol PAR m-2 s-1) set at a 22ºC, 12 h day/15ºC, 12 h night regime.
    These conditions are similar to those experienced by Hakea seedlings during the
    winter establishment and growth period. Deionized water (500 ml) was added to
    each tray daily such that each pot received about 10 ml water. After 14 days,
    all the pots containing four seedlings were harvested. Seedlings were removed
    from their pots and any adhering compost washed from the roots before oven-drying
    overnight at 80ºC. The remaining seedlings were grown on for a further 14 days
    and harvested at 28 days. Watering of the remaining pots was adjusted to maintain
    10 ml water per pot for the remainder of the experiment. Mean relative growth
    rate (RGR) was calculated using the formula given by Hunt et al. (1993).

  methods: To quantify total phenolic compounds, we 300 seeds of each of the 14 experimental
    species dishes in a dark incubator set at 15ºC. Immediately following germination
    (10-14 days), seedlings transferred to 7 x 7 cm square pots containing sand to
    peat compost mixture as above. Four of the same species were planted in each pot
    array, such that each seedling was 6 cm from neighbours. There were 10 pots per
    species. Plants were maintained in a greenhouse (25 12ºC min), and watered daily
    until 3 months this time, all shoots within each pot were and dried in an oven
    for 48 h at 50ºC. The low drying temperature reduces the risk of secondary metabolites
    (Hagerman 1988). drying, the plant material was ground using and mortar. Each
    pot of four seedlings represented single replicate (individual seedlings were
    to test accurately for phenolics). Total phenols extracted from 50 mg ground leaf
    material 7-5 ml distilled water boiled for 2 h. The extract centrifuged at 3000
    r.p.m. for 15 min and a 1 ml sample removed and added to 7-5 ml distilled water.
    To this, 1 ml Folin-Denis reagent (Waterman & Mole 1994) and 0-5 ml sodium carbonate
    (35 g per 100 ml) were added, and samples were left to stand for 15 min before
    centrifuging at 3000 r.p.m. for 15 min. The absorbance of each sample was read
    at 760 nm and plotted against a standard curve produced from a similar analysis
    of tannic acid.

  methods: Total leaf nitrogen was determined on a three-channel auto-analyser system,
    using a modified Kjeldahl digestion method (Anonymous 1977). Leaf samples were
    taken from the same plants used in the phenolic test and were prepared in a similar
    way. About 0-1 g dried and milled shoot material was digested in a 6 ml mixture
    of sulphuric acid and 6% salicylic acid overnight (Ekpete & Cornfield 1964). This
    mixture was boiled at 350ºC for 20 min, allowed to cool, and 2 ml of hydrogen
    peroxide added. The process was repeated three times until the samples became
    clear, after which a final heat treatment at 350ºC for 30 min was applied (Yuen
    & Pollard 1954). Nitrogen was colorimetrically determined (as NH4-N) by indophenol
    blue (Searle 1984).

  methods: Total leaf area was determined by measuring the area of the same leaf using
    an image analyser (DIAS II, Delta-T Devices, Cambridge, UK). Leaves were oven-dried
    at 80ºC overnight and their dry mass determined. Specific leaf area (SLA) was
    calculated by dividing leaf area by dry mass, correcting for shape of needle leaves
    (Witkowski & Lamont 1991). Each of these leaf characteristics was determined for
    20 individuals of each species.

  methods: Total leaf area was determined by measuring the area of the same leaf using
    an image analyser (DIAS II, Delta-T Devices, Cambridge, UK). Leaves were oven-dried
    at 80ºC overnight and their dry mass determined. Specific leaf area (SLA) was
    calculated by dividing leaf area by dry mass, correcting for shape of needle leaves
    (Witkowski & Lamont 1991). Leaf density was obtained by dividing SLA by leaf thickness.
    Although closely related, we used leaf density, rather than percentage dry matter
    (Wilson et al. 1999), as density takes into account air as a component of leaf
    structure and is better related to leaf structure than dry matter content.
