  description: The primary aim of this study was to determine the adequacy of plants
    grown under controlled conditions to represent traits of plants growing in a natural
    community.
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  entity_type: entity_type_column
  sampling_strategy: 'The community examined was a native grassland 20 km N of Canberra,
    Australia (35 deg 07''S, 149 deg 07''E, 725 m a.s.l.). Mean annual precipitation
    is 622 mm and mean daily maximum temperatures are 27.8 deg C in January and 11.3
    deg C in July. Soils are loams overlying clays and have generally low nutrients
    concentrations (extractable P = 12.8 mg.kg-1 +/- 4.5, K = 213 mg.kg-1 +/- 94,
    total N = 0.204% +/- 0.065). The pre-European grassy woodland and lowland grassland
    was largely cleared of trees in the mid 1800s and the native herbaceous flora
    allowed to colonise under low to moderate grazing (with some naturalisation of
    exotic species). Within a contiguous area of native grassland, 10 sites were established,
    all within a 1-km radius (to limit environmental variation). All sites (7 m x
    14 m) were fenced off in October 2004 to exclude stock grazing and allow full
    expression of species traits. Traits were measured for 14 of the most abundant
    species at the field sites, which included: Perennial C3 grasses, Austrodanthonia
    caespitosa, A. carphoides, Joycea pallida, Poa labillardieri; Perennial C4 grasses,
    Aristida ramosa, Bothriochloa macra, Themeda australis; Annual C3 grasses, Aira
    elegantissima, Vulpia bromoides; Perennial forbs: Hypochaeris radicata, Plantago
    varia; Annual legumes: Trifolium dubium, T. subterraneum; and a Perennial mat
    rush, Lomandra filiformis. Within a contiguous area of native grassland, 10 sites
    were established, all within a 1-km radius (to limit environmental variation).
    All sites (7 m x 14 m) were fenced off in October 2004 to exclude stock grazing
    and allow full expression of species traits. Traits were measured for 14 of the
    most abundant species at the field sites. Functional traits of all species were
    measured during their peak growth period in spring (November / December 2005).
    In the field, five replicate plants or leaves were sampled, with each replicate
    from a different field site.'
