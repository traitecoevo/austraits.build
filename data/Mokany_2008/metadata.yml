  description: The primary aim of this study was to determine the adequacy of plants
    grown under controlled conditions to represent traits of plants growing in a natural
    community.
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: Within a contiguous area of native grassland, 10 sites were established,
    all within a 1-km radius (to limit environmental variation). All sites (7 m x
    14 m) were fenced off in October 2004 to exclude stock grazing and allow full
    expression of species traits. Traits were measured for 14 of the most abundant
    species at the field sites. Functional traits of all species were measured during
    their peak growth period in spring (November / December 2005). In the field, five
    replicate plants or leaves were sampled, with each replicate from a different
    field site.

    description: 'The community examined was a native grassland 20 km N of Canberra,
      Australia (35°07'' S, 149°07'' E, 725 m a.s.l.). Mean annual precipitation is
      622 mm and mean daily maximum temperatures are 27.8°C in January and 11.3 °C
      in July. Soils are loams overlying clays and have generally low nutrients concentrations
      (extractable P = 12.8 mg.kg–1 +/- 4.5, K = 213 mg.kg–1 +/- 94, total N = 0.204%
      +/- 0.065). The pre-European grassy woodland and lowland grassland was largely
      cleared of trees in the mid 1800s and the native herbaceous flora allowed to
      colonise under low to moderate grazing (with some naturalisation of exotic species).
      Within a contiguous area of native grassland, 10 sites were established, all
      within a 1-km radius (to limit environmental variation). All sites (7 m x 14
      m) were fenced off in October 2004 to exclude stock grazing and allow full expression
      of species traits. Traits were measured for 14 of the most abundant species
      at the field sites, which included: Perennial C3 grasses: Austrodanthonia caespitosa,
      A. carphoides, Joycea pallida, Poa labillardieri; Perennial C4 grasses: Aristida
      ramosa, Bothriochloa macra, Themeda australis; Annual C3 grasses: Aira elegantissima,
      Vulpia bromoides; Perennial forbs: Hypochaeris radicata, Plantago varia; Annual
      legumes: Trifolium dubium, T. subterraneum; and a Perennial mat rush: Lomandra
      filiformis.'

    and non-green biomass, measured at height intervals of
    0 - 5 cm, 5 - 10 cm, and then 10 cm intervals), and root
    biomass (in the top 10 cm of soil for field plants and in
    all 10 cm intervals for potted plants). From these measurements we calculated leaf mass ratio (green shoot /
    total shoot), root:shoot ratio (for the top 10 cm of root
    biomass), mean height of the green canopy (height at
    which half the green leaf is both above and below), and
    a root biomass depth distribution coefficient for pot
    grown plants ('B' from Gale & Grigal (1987), where

    For each species in each pot treatment,
    we took one replicate sample of fine roots (< 1 mm) at
    a depth of 20-30 cm from each of the three pots, washed
    them over a 1 mm screen, and measured fresh root mass.
    Each sample was stained, suspended in 7 mm of water
    in a 15 cm diameter clear petri dish, scanned digitally
    at 600 dots per inch with a Hewlett Packard Scanjet
    5470c, and then dried at 80 °C for 3 days. Each digital
    image was analysed using WinRhizo 3.9f Pro (Regent
    Instruments, Quebec) to determine the root sample's
    total volume, length, surface area, and average diameter.
