  description: The primary aim of this study was to determine the adequacy of plants
    grown under controlled conditions to represent traits of plants growing in a natural
    community.
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: Within a contiguous area of native grassland, 10 sites were established,
    all within a 1-km radius (to limit environmental variation). All sites (7 m x
    14 m) were fenced off in October 2004 to exclude stock grazing and allow full
    expression of species traits. Traits were measured for 14 of the most abundant
    species at the field sites. Functional traits of all species were measured during
    their peak growth period in spring (November / December 2005). In the field, five
    replicate plants or leaves were sampled, with each replicate from a different
    field site.

    description: 'The community examined was a native grassland 20 km N of Canberra,
      Australia (35 deg 07''S, 149 deg 07''E, 725 m a.s.l.). Mean annual precipitation
      is 622 mm and mean daily maximum temperatures are 27.8 deg C in January and
      11.3 deg C in July. Soils are loams overlying clays and have generally low nutrients
      concentrations (extractable P = 12.8 mg.kg-1 +/- 4.5, K = 213 mg.kg-1 +/- 94,
      total N = 0.204% +/- 0.065). The pre-European grassy woodland and lowland grassland
      was largely cleared of trees in the mid 1800s and the native herbaceous flora
      allowed to colonise under low to moderate grazing (with some naturalisation
      of exotic species). Within a contiguous area of native grassland, 10 sites were
      established, all within a 1-km radius (to limit environmental variation). All
      sites (7 m x 14 m) were fenced off in October 2004 to exclude stock grazing
      and allow full expression of species traits. Traits were measured for 14 of
      the most abundant species at the field sites, which included: Perennial C3 grasses,
      Austrodanthonia caespitosa, A. carphoides, Joycea pallida, Poa labillardieri;
      Perennial C4 grasses, Aristida ramosa, Bothriochloa macra, Themeda australis;
      Annual C3 grasses, Aira elegantissima, Vulpia bromoides; Perennial forbs: Hypochaeris
      radicata, Plantago varia; Annual legumes: Trifolium dubium, T. subterraneum;
      and a Perennial mat rush, Lomandra filiformis.'

questions:
  contributor: Your manuscript indicates that some data were collected on field-grown
    plants and other data on potted plants. In the raw data files you sent, it isn't
    clear which data were collected on which plants - should I assume the file with
    raw root data is all for potted plants, since there are just three replicates.
    Right now, I've merged the spreadsheets based on unique "species by replicate"
    combinations, but I suspect, I should add in a "field versus pot" column as well,which
    I would probably enter as a "contextual" variable.
  question2: In your site means spreadsheet you have the root depth distribution coefficient.
    Is this a value that can be calculated at the individual level or just from species
    means?
