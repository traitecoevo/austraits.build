  description: Study relating variation in architectural properties (leaf angle and
    leaf size) to cross-species patterns of leaf display, light capture and simulated
    carbon gain in branching-units of 38 perennial species occurring at two sites
    in Australian forest.
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: Two sites were chosen within Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park,
    Sydney, Australia. Both were temperate forest with a high diversity of shrub species
    under a moderately open eucalypt canopy. The sites differed in soil fertility
    (94 vs 440 mg kg-1 total P - Wright et al ., 2001) but had similar average annual
    rainfall (1220 mm distributed throughout the year) and temperature (22 deg , 13
    deg C). The vegetation at the low nutrient site (33 deg 41' 38''S, 151 deg 8'35''E)
    was fire-prone low open sclerophyll woodland with a species rich understorey of
    woody shrubs, and emergent eucalypts to 15 m (Rice & Westoby, 1983). The site
    was last burnt in 1990. The soils are derived from Hawkesbury Sandstone parent
    material. The vegetation at the higher nutrient site (33 deg 34'44''S, 151 deg
    17'32''E) is fire-sensitive closed forest, with an overstorey to 20 m dominated
    by Syncarpia glomulifera , Eucalyptus umbra and Livistona australis . Woody shrubs,
    climbers, ferns and cycads dominate the understorey. The soils are derived from
    a weathered volcanic dyke. Plant growth is continuous throughout the year, although
    species may exhibit a flush of new growth in spring. Further site details are
    provided by (Wright et al ., 2001). Hereafter, the sites are referred to as medium
    LAI (closed forest) and low LAI (open woodland) sites. Sampling At either site,
    a large number of small to moderate-sized woody perennial shrub species coexist
    in a similar light environment. Most species exhibit a rigid, sclerophyllous architecture,
    with comparatively little scope for diurnal or seasonal variation in leaf arrangement
    (pers. obs.). All species with flat or simply folded leaves, as assumed by the
    YPLANT software, were chosen for study. This included 26 species from the low
    LAI and 12 from the medium LAI site. The first three undamaged individuals of
    each species encountered further than 10 m away from an access track were sampled.
    Data were collected between 20 September 2000 and 26 November 2001. For each individual,
    architectural information about the leading vertical branching unit, or 'tuft',
    on each plant was recorded. A tuft was defined as all leaves and side branches
    back to the oldest leaf along a leaf age sequence. This level of organisation
    represents an intermediate scale between the leaf and the whole plant, spanning
    the full range of leaf ages and reflecting the tendency for plants to consist
    of repeated architectural units. Tufts, as opposed to whole plants, were sampled
    for practical reasons and in an attempt to provide a sizeindependent unit of comparison
    across species. For each individual a 3D description of the tuft leaf arrangement,
    basal and terminal stem diameters (vernier calipers) and plant height were recorded.

  methods: For each individual, architectural information about the leading vertical
    branching unit, or 'tuft', on each plant was recorded. A tuft was defined as all
    leaves and side branches back to the oldest leaf along a leaf age sequence. This
    level of organisation represents an intermediate scale between the leaf and the
    whole plant, spanning the full range of leaf ages and reflecting the tendency
    for plants to consist of repeated architectural units. Tufts, as opposed to whole
    plants, were sampled for practical reasons and in an attempt to provide a sizeindependent
    unit of comparison across species. The three-dimensional leaf arrangement of each
    plant was recorded using a FASTRAK 3D-digitizer (Polhemus, Colchester, VT, USA),
    in conjunction with the software package FLORADIG (CSIRO Entomology, Brisbane,
    Australia). The digitizer includes a magnetic signal receiver and pointer, allowing
    the user to record the 3D spatial co-ordinates of the pointer within a hemisphere
    of 3 m diameter from the receiver. Individual plants are digitally reconstructed
    by recording a series of point co-ordinates, and the relevant connectivity between
    points. Stem segments and petioles are characterized by their elevation angle,
    azimuth, length and diameter. Individual leaves are characterized by their length
    together with the azimuth and elevation angle of two vectors on the lamina surface.
    YPLANT software (Pearcy & Yang, 1996) was used to estimate light interception
    and a potential carbon gain for different sample periods throughout a single day
    and integrated across entire days. The 3D description of leaf arrangement recorded
    for each tuft in FLORADIG was converted to the appropriate YPLANT format using
    a program written in C. Sampling time for individual tufts ranged from 20 min
    to 2.5 h, depending on the number and size of leaves. Although still time consuming,
    the methods presented here represent a marked acceleration of data collection
    in architectural studies using the YPLANT software. Full details regarding the
    collection of architectural information are given in Appendix S1.
