  description: In severely phosphorus (P)-impoverished environments, plants have evolved
    to use P very efficiently. Yet, it is unclear how P allocation in leaves contributes
    to their photosynthetic P-use efficiency (PPUE) and position along the leaf economics
    spectrum (LES). We address this question in 10 species of Banksia and Hakea, two
    highly P-efficient Proteaceae genera.
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: Species selection and study area ^p Five Banksia species (Proteaceae)
    and five Hakea species (Proteaceae) were selected as the highly abundant species
    in the targeted extremely P-impoverished area of Badgingarra National Park (S30.412,
    E115.367), c. 200 km north of Perth, Western Australia (Fig. 1). The vegetation
    is kwongan heath, dominated by sclerophyllous shrubs of the family Proteaceae,
    followed by Myrtaceae and Fabaceae (Pate & Beard, 1984). The climate is Mediterranean
    with hot dry summers and cool wet winters, with a mean annual maximum temperature
    of 26°C and a mean annual rainfall of 440 mm (1999-2018, Badgingarra Research
    Station, Australian Bureau of Meteorology, http://www.bom.gov.au). Five individuals
    of each species were sampled at four sites along a c. 8 m elevation gradient with
    contrasting soils (Fig. 1), with one species (Hakea conchifolia) found at two
    sites (Fig. 1c,e). ^p Mature fully expanded undamaged and sun-exposed leaves were
    collected on 16 or 17 June 2020, scanned with an optical scanner (Epson Perfection
    V800 Photo; Epson, Los Alamitos, CA, USA) and the images analysed for projected
    leaf area (WinRHIZO Pro Software, Regent Instruments Inc., Québec, QC, Canada).
    Leaf thickness was measured using a portable digital calliper and calculated as
    the average thickness of three positions on the lamina along the axis from the
    base to the tip of the leaf. Leaves were oven-dried for one week at 70°C to a
    constant weight, and leaf mass per area (LMA; g m-2) was calculated as the total
    dry weight of the sample divided by its total area. Leaf dry matter content (LDMC;
    %) was calculated as the total dry weight of the samples used for determining
    LMA divided by their total fresh weight. Leaf lifespan was not measured due to
    the high leaf longevity of Australian Proteaceae as reported in previous studies
    (Veneklaas & Poot, 2003; Denton et al., 2007; Shane et al., 2014); instead, other
    traits (i.e. LMA and LDMC) were used as proxies to estimate the LES (Wright et
    al., 2004). ^p In parallel with leaf collection for LMA and leaf thickness, different
    mature fully expanded undamaged and sun-exposed leaves from the same individuals
    were harvested at the same time and immediately snap-frozen in liquid N and stored
    at -80°C before being freeze-dried for 7 d (VirTis BenchTop Pro 'K' Freeze Dryer,
    SP Scientific, Warminster, PA, USA). Freeze-dried material was finely ground using
    plastic vials and zirconium beads in a vertical ball-mill grinder (GenoGrinder;
    Spex SamplePrep, Metuchen, NJ, USA). Leaf total [N] was determined by combustion
    with a glutamic acid standard using a CN analyser (Elementar Vario Macro CNS Analyser,
    Langenselbold, Hesse, Germany). Leaf total [P] was determined by inductively coupled
    plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES, Optima 5300DV; PerkinElmer, Waltham,
    MA, USA) following acid digestion with a mixture of concentrated nitric and perchloric
    acids (Zarcinas et al., 1987).

    was taken during sampling to ensure that leaves used for gas exchange measurements
    were as similar as possible to those sampled for the other traits, that is similar
    size, age, intactness and position. Gas exchange measurements were made on clear
    sunny days between 8:30 h and 10:30 h on 16 or 17 June 2020 using a portable open-system
    infrared gas analyser (LI6400XT; LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE, USA) with 1500
    umol-1 s-1 photosynthetic photon flux density, 400 umol mol-1 CO2 with a chamber
    temperature of 23 ± 1°C and relative humidity of 55-70%. When the chamber area
    (6 cm2) was not completely filled, the leaf area inside the chamber was measured
    by scanning as described above. Light-saturated net photosynthetic rates were
    expressed on a leaf area basis (Asat,area; umol CO2 m-2 s-1) and on a leaf dry
    mass basis, using LMA for conversion (Asat,mass; nmol CO2 g-1 s-1). Instantaneous
    PPUE and instantaneous PNUE were calculated as the rate of net photosynthetic
    CO2 assimilation per unit P (umol CO2 g-1 P s-1) and N (umol CO2 g-1 N s-1), respectively.

  methods: Foliar P was separated into lipid P, metabolic P (comprising both metabolite
    P and Pi), nucleic acid P and a residual P fraction by sequential extraction based
    on the differential solubility of each class of P-containing compound using a
    modification of the method described previously (Kedrowski, 1983; Hidaka & Kitayama,
    2013; Hayes et al., 2022). In brief, ground leaf material was extracted with 12
    to 6 to 1 (v/v/v) chloroform to methanol to formic acid, then with 1 to 2 to 0.8
    (v/v/v) chloroform to methanol to water. The extracts were combined and extracted
    with chloroform-saturated water into an organic phase and an aqueous phase, which
    contained the lipid P and metabolic P fractions, respectively. The pellet was
    resuspended in 85% (v/v) methanol and extracted with 5% (w/v) trichloroacetic
    acid (TCA). After centrifugation of the sample at 5000 g at 4°C for 15 min, the
    clear supernatant was added to the metabolic P fraction. The pellet was resuspended
    in 2.5% (w/v) TCA at 95°C to extract the nucleic acids. The pellet was then transferred
    to a digestion flask by suspending in 85% (v/v) methanol three times to make the
    residual P fraction. All fractions were dried at c. 50°C and digested with a mixture
    of concentrated nitric and perchloric acids to hydrolyse esterified P (Zarcinas
    et al., 1987). The Pi concentration in each fraction was determined colorimetrically
    as described above (Motomizu et al., 1983). Metabolite P was calculated by subtracting
    Pi from metabolic P, where Pi was determined as described above. The recovery
    rate (%) was calculated as the sum of all P fractions divided by total P measured
    directly from the ground leaves by ICP-OES and ranged from 86% to 94% for our
    P fractionation method (Supporting Information Table S1).

    on the differential solubility of each class of P-containing compound using a
    modification of the method described previously (Kedrowski, 1983; Hidaka & Kitayama,
    2013; Hayes et al., 2022). In brief, ground leaf material was extracted with 12
    to 6 to 1 (v/v/v) chloroform to methanol to formic acid, then with 1 to 2 to 0.8
    (v/v/v) chloroform to methanol to water. The extracts were combined and extracted
    with chloroform-saturated water into an organic phase and an aqueous phase, which
    contained the lipid P and metabolic P fractions, respectively. The pellet was
    resuspended in 85% (v/v) methanol and extracted with 5% (w/v) trichloroacetic
    acid (TCA). After centrifugation of the sample at 5000 g at 4°C for 15 min, the
    clear supernatant was added to the metabolic P fraction. The pellet was resuspended
    in 2.5% (w/v) TCA at 95°C to extract the nucleic acids. The pellet was then transferred
    to a digestion flask by suspending in 85% (v/v) methanol three times to make the
    residual P fraction. All fractions were dried at c. 50°C and digested with a mixture
    of concentrated nitric and perchloric acids to hydrolyse esterified P (Zarcinas
    et al., 1987). The Pi concentration in each fraction was determined colorimetrically
    as described above (Motomizu et al., 1983). Metabolite P was calculated by subtracting
    Pi from metabolic P, where Pi was determined as described above. The recovery
    rate (%) was calculated as the sum of all P fractions divided by total P measured
    directly from the ground leaves by ICP-OES and ranged from 86% to 94% for our
    P fractionation method (Supporting Information Table S1).

    were harvested at the same time and immediately snap-frozen in liquid N and stored
    at -80°C before being freeze-dried for 7 d (VirTis BenchTop Pro 'K' Freeze Dryer,
    SP Scientific, Warminster, PA, USA). Freeze-dried material was finely ground using
    plastic vials and zirconium beads in a vertical ball-mill grinder (GenoGrinder;
    Spex SamplePrep, Metuchen, NJ, USA). Leaf total [P] was determined by inductively
    coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES, Optima 5300DV; PerkinElmer,
    Waltham, MA, USA) following acid digestion with a mixture of concentrated nitric
    and perchloric acids (Zarcinas et al., 1987).

    attached leaves from the same individuals and at the same time as leaves were
    collected to measure other leaf traits. Care was taken during sampling to ensure
    that leaves used for gas exchange measurements were as similar as possible to
    those sampled for the other traits, that is similar size, age, intactness and
    position. Gas exchange measurements were made on clear sunny days between 8:30
    h and 10:30 h on 16 or 17 June 2020 using a portable open-system infrared gas
    analyser (LI6400XT; LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE, USA) with 1500 umol-1 s-1
    photosynthetic photon flux density, 400 umol mol-1 CO2 with a chamber temperature
    of 23 ± 1°C and relative humidity of 55-70%. When the chamber area (6 cm2) was
    not completely filled, the leaf area inside the chamber was measured by scanning
    as described above. Light-saturated net photosynthetic rates were expressed on
    a leaf area basis (Asat,area; umol CO2 m-2 s-1) and on a leaf dry mass basis,
    using LMA for conversion (Asat,mass; nmol CO2 g-1 s-1). Instantaneous PPUE and
    instantaneous PNUE were calculated as the rate of net photosynthetic CO2 assimilation
    per unit P (umol CO2 g-1 P s-1) and N (umol CO2 g-1 N s-1), respectively.
