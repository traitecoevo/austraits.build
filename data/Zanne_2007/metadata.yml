  notes: Site data were extracted from Wright 2011 (doi.org/10.1046/j.0269-8463.2001.00542.x);
    Wright_2002 includes many additional trait measurements for the same 'site by
    species' combinations.

  methods: Stem hydraulic conductivity was measured on branch samples using previously
    described methods (Zwieniecki & Holbrook, 1998; Sperry & Hacke, 2002). Branches
    were hydrated overnight to avoid artifacts (Wheeler et al., 2013), and the submerged
    branches were cut longer than the maximum vessel length (Cavender-Bares & Holbrook,
    2001).  Side branches were sealed using water-insoluble acrylic-based glue (Loctite
    Super Bonder Quick Gel 409 and Accelerator 712, Henkel Australia Pty. Ltd., Kilsyth,
    VIC, Australia). Stem ends were then wrapped in parafilm and placed into connective
    tubing. Twenty mM KCl (made with deionized, degassed water) was forced through
    a 0.22 um filter and into the distal stem end at 0.1 MPa. Outflow from the proximal
    end was logged in 30 s intervals onto a balance. Stems were flushed until the
    readings to the balance stabilized and then conductance was measured as k = g
    MPa-1 s-1.  Measures were corrected by subtracting the background flow rate when
    no pressure was applied to the stem. Conductivity (Kh; g m MPa-1 s-1) was determined
    by multiplying k by branch length. Sapwood specific (Ks) or leaf specific (KL)
    conductivity was calculated by dividing Kh by either total cross sectional area
    of the stem (minus bark; m2) or total leaf area subtending the distal branch end,
    (m2) respectively.
