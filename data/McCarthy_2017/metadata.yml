  description: A regional-scale assessment of using metabolic scaling theory to predict
    ecosystem properties
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: assumed_adult
  sampling_strategy: Australia has been classified into 89 distinct bioregions based
    on climate, substrate and biological diversity (Thackway & Cresswell, 1995); for
    this study we restrict our analyses to the portion of the southeast Queensland
    bioregion (SEQ) that falls in the state of Queensland (Fig. 5-1). SEQ extends
    along the eastern coastline of Australia from the New South Wales/Queensland border
    (c. 28.1°S) to c. 20 km NW of Gladstone (c. 23.8°S) with the western boundary
    broadly following the Great Dividing Range. The region's subtropical climate supports
    species and vegetation types common in both temperate and tropical regions and
    consequently exhibits a high level of species and structural diversity (Burbidge,
    1960). The broad categories of vegetation types in SEQ include sclerophyll woodlands
    (open or closed forests and woodlands, usually with a Eucalyptus overstorey; 36%
    of SEQ), subtropical rainforest (diverse, closed-canopy forests with multiple
    strata; 5%) and heath (dense shrublands with or without a sparse overstorey, usually
    in poor soils; 2%) (Chapter 3). The remaining land in the region has either been
    cleared for agricultural, urban or peri-urban purposes or contains regenerating
    vegetation not considered to be in a mature state. The plant community data used
    for our spatially-implicit predictions of productivity were collected by the Queensland
    Herbarium (the "CORVEG" dataset) and were originally collected to inform the State's
    vegetation mapping. These data were collected across four levels of sampling intensities
    ranging from "primary" (permanent, ongoing monitoring sites) to "quaternary" (rapid
    assessments of dominant species and structure), of which we used the "secondary"
    sampling intensity (comprehensive, one-off surveys) (Neldner et al., 2012). We
    considered only woody species in our analysis. Inter-tidal sites and some other
    coastal sites were excluded (for reasons outlined in the Spatial layers section
    below), leaving 1,100 sites, comprising 820 species (Fig. 5-1). Abundance measurements
    at these sites were recorded in the field as crown-cover scores calculated from
    a central 50 m transect in plots measuring either 50x10 m (500 m2) or 50x20 m
    (1,000 m2), with all species allocated to a range strata delineated by height
    (Neldner et al., 2012). We include all strata >=1 m in height in the present study.
    Species identified within a plot but not encountered along the central transect
    were assigned an arbitrarily low cover value of 0.1%. To obtain estimates of total
    abundance for each site from these crown-cover data, a model was developed to
    robustly predict stem counts (measured a subset of calibration sites) from CORVEG
    crown-cover and stratum data (Chapter 2). Functional traits were used to further
    explain the deviation between MST-predicted and measured productivity. We calculated
    site-based community weighted means for four functional traits, maximum height,
    specific leaf area, wood density and seed mass; using data collected and collated
    for as many of the 820 species as possible. Trait values were determined from
    samples collected and processed following the protocols detailed in Pérez-Harguindeguy
    et al. (2013). Trait data for additional species were obtained from the TRY plant
    database (Kattge et al., 2011) and various additional published sources (Appendix
    5.1). Maximum height data was obtained for 816 species (99.5%), specific leaf
    area for 552 species (67%), wood density for 535 species (65%) and seed mass for
    523 species (64%). This equates to 99.9%, 89%, 90% and 87% of species occurrence
    records across the 1,100 sites for maximum height, specific leaf area, wood density
    and seed mass, respectively.

  unit_in: mg/mm3
  trait_name: wood_density
  value_type: raw_value
  replicates: 1
  methods: Stem-specific density (SSD,mgmm–3 or kg dm–3) is the oven-dry mass (at
    70C for 72 h, but see Special cases or extras in the present Section) of a section
    of the main stem of a plant divided by the volume of the same section, when still
    fresh. (From Pérez-Harguindeguy et. al 2016)
- var_in: SLA
  unit_in: mm2/mg
  trait_name: specific_leaf_area
  value_type: raw_value

  methods: Specific leaf area (SLA) is the one-sided area of a fresh leaf, divided
    by its oven-dry mass. (Note that leaf mass per area (LMA), specific leaf mass
    (SLM) and specific leaf weight (SLW), are simply 1/SLA). (From Pérez-Harguindeguy
    et. al 2016)
- var_in: seed.mass
  unit_in: mg
  trait_name: seed_mass
  value_type: raw_value

  methods: Seed mass, also called seed size, is the oven-dry mass of an average seed
    of a species, expressed in mg. (From Pérez-Harguindeguy et. al 2016)
- var_in: leaf.area
  unit_in: mm2
  trait_name: leaf_area
  value_type: raw_value
  replicates: 1
  methods: The area of a leaf (also called leaf area, LA) is the most common metric
    for leaf size and is defined as the one-sided or projected area of an individual
    leaf, expressed in mm2 (From Pérez-Harguindeguy et. al 2016)

questions: 
  questions for author: Your seed size data seem very low compared to other AusTraits entries. Can you confirm the units are correct. Also, do you have location (lat/lon) information for your data? I could not find any site-specific data in your thesis, but sites are given for each measurement in the data file.
