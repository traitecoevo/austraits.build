  description: Understanding the drivers of variation in thermal ecophysiology to
    characterize the risks to plant communities posed by the increasing frequencies
    and intensities of heat waves predicted with climate warming.
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: 2.1 Study site & species ^p Photosynthetic heat tolerance and
    its interactions with salinity and dehydration were surveyed in 12 species from
    the Daintree River estuary system, Daintree National Park, Far North Queensland,
    Australia (16°17'24″ S 145°24'36″ E; Figure 1). Long-term monthly rainfall and
    temperature data were obtained from the Low Isles meteorological station (1968-2021;
    http://bom.gov.au/climate/data, accessed on 18 July 2022). Peak mean daily maximum
    and minimum air temperatures occur in December (32.5 ± 0.9°C) and July (20.6 ±
    0.8°C), respectively. The Daintree River estuary system has a tropical monsoonal
    climate with mean annual precipitation of 2295 ± 540 mm year-1. The Daintree River
    estuary system is a relatively species-rich mangrove community containing approximately
    28 of the 45 mangrove species present in Australasia (Duke et al., 1998). This
    high species richness occurs due to the estuary systems' latitudinal position
    within the 20-30°C winter-summer isocline, as well as its long length (~20 km),
    high rainfall (>2000 mm) and large catchment area, which all serve to moderate
    the influences of salinity (Duke et al., 1998). ^p We surveyed mangrove species
    of diverse phylogenetic origins, differentially distributed along the estuary,
    spanning a range of salinities (Figure 1; Table 1). To assess the effects of growth
    salinity on PHT among mangroves, our study design included mangrove species distributed
    exclusively at higher and lower salinities, as well as species with wide estuarine
    distributions enabling high- and low-salinity contrasts within species (Table
    1). Five species were sampled that occurred exclusively at low-salinity sites,
    four species were sampled from both lower and higher-salinity sites within their
    respective distributions, and finally, we sampled three species that occurred
    exclusively at high-salinity sites (Figure 1a,b). At a given salinity, a fully
    sun-exposed terminal branch was obtained from five replicate trees of each species
    (n = 5 per species), with 80 trees surveyed in total. Plant material was collected
    between 11 am and 1 pm on a misty overcast day in the early dry season (5 July
    2022), beginning with low-salinity samples. Plant material collection was authorized
    by the Queensland Department of Environment and Science under Marine Park Permit
    no. P-MPP-100065169.^p Temperature data for the region during sampling were obtained
    from the Low Isles meteorological station (http://bom.gov.au/climate/data, accessed
    on 18 June 2023). Maximum and minimum temperatures on the day of sampling were
    18.3°C and 20.5°C, respectively. Maximum and minimum temperatures of the 5 days
    preceding sampling were 23.1 ± 1.3°C and 21.2 ± 0.9°C, respectively (values are
    mean ± SD). Estuarine surface water salinity was measured at the base of each
    tree with a handheld refractometer (AST Co. Ltd Japan; Table 1). As all species
    were collected from the estuarine fringe in loosely consolidated soils, the osmotic
    potentials of the estuarine salinities reflect those experienced at the roots.
    We note, however, that standard seawater has a salinity of 35 practical salinity
    units (PSU; parts per thousand (ppt), corresponding to an osmotic potential of
    -2.4 MPa at 25°C; Harvey, 1955) and that the salinities measured at the estuary
    mouth at the time of the experiment were substantially lower than seawater (Table
    1). Estuarine salinities fluctuate temporally due to the varying tidal influences,
    catchment outflow and evapotranspiration, with salinities in the Daintree estuarine
    system ranging annually from freshwater to maximum values ranging from 0-3 ppt
    at the upstream mangrove distribution limit to 11-35 ppt at the estuary mouth
    (Duke et al., 1998).

  methods: A small sun-exposed canopy shoot containing several leaves was sampled
    from each tree at 2-4 m using a pole pruner. Plant material was transported back
    to the field lab in moistened black garbage bags and held, out of the sun, at
    ambient temperatures. From the tip of each shoot, the third most recently fully
    expanded healthy leaf was selected, and a razor blade was used to excise three
    rectangular pieces of leaf lamina, each 12 mm x 30 mm. Rectangular leaf sections
    were stored in small plastic chambers and were either weighed and assayed for
    Tcrit immediately (at initial water content) or subjected to a bench-drying treatment
    under dim light prior to Tcrit measurement. The mean difference in water content
    following dehydration was -0.725 ± 0.049 gwater g-1dry mass (p < 0.001). This
    level of dehydration was selected to induce a strong dehydration response without
    negatively affecting photosystem health. No decline in leaf Fv/Fm was observed
    among leaves subject to the dehydration treatment, with initial Fv/Fm values of
    0.762 ± 0.005, and Fv/Fm values following dehydration treatment 0.764 ± 0.00522
    (p = 0.63, repeated-measures ANOVA). Following bench-drying, each leaf section
    was held for >40 min in darkness in a small plastic chamber to allow time for
    spatial equilibration of water within the leaf section. Once equilibrated, two
    neighbouring 1 cm diameter leaf discs were excised from each leaf rectangle. One
    leaf disc was used to obtain a proxy measurement of leaf water content per unit
    dry mass (WC g g-1) following oven drying at 70C for 72 h, and leaf dry mass per
    unit area (LMA) was calculated for the same leaf disc. The second disc was subject
    to the thermal tolerance assay. ^p Differences in photosynthetic (PSII) heat tolerance
    were explored by comparison of Tcrit and Tmax from curves characterizing temperature-dependent
    changes in basal chlorophyll a fluorescence (T-F0) (Arnold et al., 2021; Schreiber
    & Berry, 1977; Schreiber & Bilger, 1987). The experimental setup consisted of
    a Peltier heating plate (CP-121HT; TE-Technology, Inc., Michigan, USA; 152 x 152
    mm surface) controlled by LabVIEW software (National Instruments, Texas, USA).
    The Peltier plate was topped with gridded paper containing 45 referenced cells,
    each containing one leaf disc from each tree. Each leaf disc was topped with a
    type-T thermocouple (Omega Engineering), and leaf temperatures were logged at
    5-s intervals with a dataTaker DT85 (Lontek, Australia). The plate-grid-leaf-thermocouple
    setup was capped with a double-glazed glass plate to minimize heat loss and maintain
    contact between the thermocouple and the leaf disc. A pulse-amplitude modulated
    chlorophyll fluorescence imaging system (Maxi-Imaging-PAM; Heinz Walz GmbH, Effeltrich,
    Germany) was used to measure fluorescence with the detector mounted 185 mm above
    the Peltier plate. Minimal fluorescence (F0) was first measured after leaves had
    been dark adapted for 30 min, then re-measured at 20s intervals. To screen individuals
    for healthy photosynthetic function, before each heating assay we measured the
    maximum quantum yield of PSII (FV/FM) by measuring maximal fluorescence (FM) with
    a saturating flash, variable fluorescence (FV, FM - F0) and calculating their
    ratio FV/FM (Maxwell & Johnson, 2000). Regions of interest were then drawn over
    each sample using ImagingWin software (PC software ImagingWinGigE V2.56p) to record
    basal fluorescence from the tissue, carefully avoiding cut edges of leaf tissue.
    The heating assay began at an ambient temperature of 20°C and ended at 65°C with
    a heating rate of 30°C h-1.

questions:
  question1: After generating the report and noting what low "leaf dry mass" and "leaf
    fresh mass" values you had, I realised that your "leaf dry mass" and "leaf fresh
    mass" columns probably represented values for just the excised square, not an
    entire leaf. Is this correct? Because then I will "unmap" them.
  question2: Related to the above, if you have the dry mass, fresh mass, or area of
    individual leaves those are all traits I can include.
  question3: Currently your columns `Wca.m2` and `Wci` are not mapped in as traits,
    because I've interpreted them to be "intermediate" measurements to document the
    effect of your benchtop drying. Let me know if I've mis-interpreted this.
  question4: Tcrit and Tmax are not currently traits in AusTraits. I've added them
    into the metadata file, which makes it easy to "map" them to a trait when we next
    expand the list of supported traits.
