  description: Study investigating the vulnerability of mangrove species to freeze-induced
    xylem embolism, with reference to vessel diameter.
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: Plant material ^p Five species of mangroves (including non-Australian
    species) were collected from natural populations growing near their latitudinal
    limits. In Australia, Avicennia marina (Forsk.) Vierh, var. australasica (Walp.)
    Moldenke (Acanthaceae) and Aegiceras corniculatum (L.) Blanco (Myrsinaceae) were
    collected in New South Wales, at Batemans Bay (35°42'S, 150°12'E), during July
    and August 2003. Rhizophora stylosa Griff. (Rhizophoraceae) was collected in Queensland,
    near Jacobs Well (27°46'S, 153°22'E) during September 2003. Cold-hardening can
    affect measurements of freeze-induced cavitation (Sakai et al., 1981). Collections
    were therefore made in the coldest month at three of the four sites, and during
    very early spring at the Jacobs Well site. It can be difficult to determine the
    age of mangrove wood in all species (Tomlinson, 1994) because of their generally
    aseasonal habitats (but see Verheyden et al., 2005); however, all measurements
    were made on mature branches at least 1 yr old and 2.5-7.7 mm in diameter; most
    of the variation in diameter was the result of differences between species. ^p
    Occurrence of freezing at collection sites ^p In southern Australia, mild frosts
    are common - minimums of 0°C, -0.61°C and -3°C were recorded in mangrove communities
    during the study (data not shown) and 13-yr records report minimums of -2.9°C
    (Commonwealth Bureau of Meteorology, 2001). ^p Interaction of freezing and tension
    in excised branches ^p Terminal, leaf-bearing branches c. 1 m in length were collected
    during periods of minimal transpiration and xylem tension between 20:00 and 22:00
    h for all species except R. stylosa, which was harvested between 05:00 and 07:00
    h. For each species, 23-15 individuals were sampled; this was reduced to 10 in
    R. mangle, where only one experiment was conducted. Branches were cut in pairs,
    with one branch assigned to the freezing treatment and the other to the coldstorage
    control. 'Tension' and 'tension relieved' samples were gathered on successive
    days. ^p Vessel diameter measurements ^p Vessel diameters were measured on sections
    taken from segments used for hydraulic measurements in both the US and Australia.

  methods: Vessel diameters were measured on sections taken from segments used for
    hydraulic measurements in both the US and Australia. Three images were taken per
    cross-section in each stem, accounting for approx. three-quarters of the total
    area of the section. For each species, two stems each from five individuals were
    used. In Australia, segments preserved in ethanol were hand-sectioned, stained
    with toluidine blue, and photographed at 100x magnification on an Axioskop light
    microscope (Carl Zeiss) with a Spot Camera (Diagnostic Instruments, Sterling Heights,
    MI, USA). All images were analyzed using thresholding and particle analysis utilities
    in analySIS 3.2 (Soft Imaging System, Gulfview Heights, South Australia, Australia).
