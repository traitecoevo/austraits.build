  description: An assessment of key functional traits related to drought and flood
    flows to understand the physiological constraints on the distribution of riparian
    tree species in relation to the water regime, essential for informed water resource
    management that seeks to limit impacts on riparian trees.
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: The study site was approximately 10 km south-west of Fitzroy
    Crossing (18°11'S 125°34'E), along the lower Fitzroy River in the Kimberley Region
    of Western Australia (Figure S1). The region has a wet-dry tropical climate, with
    approximately 90% of annual rainfall occurring in the wet season, November-April
    (Warfe et al., 2011). Annual rainfall is highly variable and ranged from 250 to
    1063 mm between 1997 and 2021 at the Fitzroy Crossing Station 3093 (18.18S, 125.56E)
    (BOM, 2020; Figure S2). Seasonal rainfall patterns are reflected in river discharge,
    which ranges from approximately 800 m3 s-1 in the wet season to 100 m3 s-1 in
    the dry (Pusey & Kath, 2015). The study site was along a 1 km stretch of river,
    covering an area of approximately 0.3 km2, and included anabranch channels. The
    study area is broadly representative of riparian and floodplain vegetation of
    the region, although the current study did not capture the full distribution of
    floodplain vegetation, with the floodplain extending up to 15 km from the main
    river channel, with a complex and patchy hydrogeomorphology and systems of braided
    channels (Harrington & Harrington, 2015). ^p Nine dominant woody tree species,
    determined as species of interest from previous vegetation surveys (Canham, Beesley,
    et al., 2021), were included in this study; Atalaya hemiglauca (F.Muell.) Benth.,
    Barringtonia acutangula (L.) Gaertn., Lysiphyllum cunninghamii (Benth.) De Wit,
    Eucalyptus camaldulensis subsp. obtusa (Blakely) Brooker & M.W.McDonald, Eucalyptus
    microtheca F.Muell., Ficus coronulata Miq., Melaleuca argentea W.Fitzg., Melaleuca
    leucadendra (L.) L. and Terminalia platyphylla F.Muell. The selected species occupy
    different habitats within the riparian and floodplain area, as inferred from the
    broadscale distribution of species in relation to the hydrological metric of inundation
    duration (Canham, Beesley, et al., 2021; Freestone et al., 2022). For example,
    M. argentea and M. leucadendra are restricted to riverbanks, which experience
    a longer duration of flooding (Canham, Beesley, et al., 2021) and greater access
    to alluvial groundwater (Brock, 1993; Canham, Duvert, et al., 2021). In contrast,
    A. hemiglauca and L. cunninghamii have a wide distribution, ranging from the riverbank
    to the savanna (Table 1). The species also varied in deciduousness, with some
    species, including the two Melaleuca species and two Eucalyptus species being
    evergreen, while other species are deciduous or semi-deciduous (Table 1). Ten
    replicate trees of each species were randomly selected and individuals of the
    same species were at least 10 m apart. All sampling was conducted during the dry
    season of June 2019.

  methods: Fifteen mature leaves were collected to assess the six leaf traits, LMA,
    LDMC, d13C, % C, C:N and psi100. Leaves were collected from multiple sun-exposed
    branches for each replicate tree, placed between sheets of moist paper towel in
    a sealed humidified plastic bag and rehydrated following the methods of Garnier
    et al. (2001) and Pérez-Harguindeguy et al. (2013). These rehydrated fresh leaves
    were then used for the analysis of all leaf traits. ^p To calculate LMA (g m-2)
    and LDMC (mg g-1), five leaves, including petioles, from each replicate tree were
    scanned using a flatbed scanner, and leaf area was calculated using ImageJ software
    (Schneider et al., 2012). Rehydrated leaves were weighed and then dried at 70°C
    for 72 h and reweighed. The LMA was calculated by dividing leaf dry mass by leaf
    area and LDMC was calculated by dividing leaf dry weight by leaf fresh weight.

    rehydrated leaves per replicate tree were frozen and kept at -20°C until analysis
    in the laboratory. Cryovials containing leaf samples were dipped in liquid nitrogen,
    and then leaf sap was extracted using a sap press and transferred into sample
    tubes. The osmolality of this sap was measured using a freezing point depression
    osmometer (Fiske 210 Micro-Osmometer, Norwood, MA, USA). Osmolality was converted
    to osmotic potential using the van't Hoff equation.

  methods: To determine SSD (mg mm-3), a 3-cm-long stem sample was collected from
    each tree from just below the oldest leaves on the branch, and the volume determined
    using the water displacement method (Pérez-Harguindeguy et al., 2013). The stem
    samples were then dried at 70°C for 72 h and reweighed. The SSD was calculated
    by dividing the dry weight of the stem by the volume of fresh material. ^p Vessel
    anatomy was investigated for each tree using a 3-cm-long stem sample cut just
    below the oldest leaves, with a maximum diameter of 15 mm, which was preserved
    in 70% ethanol. Stems were transverse-sectioned by hand and stained with Toluidine
    Blue. Multiple digital images were then taken at 5x magnification and analysed
    using ImageJ (Schneider et al., 2012). The area of individual xylem conduits was
    measured, and the equivalent circle vessel diameter (Scholz et al., 2013) was
    calculated for 100 randomly selected conduits. Xylem vessel density was calculated
    by counting the number of xylem vessels within a 0.25 um2 area using a randomised
    offset grid in ImageJ (Schneider et al., 2012).

  methods: Species' hydrological habitat preferences were inferred from previous studies
    of the broadscale distribution of species in relation to flood inundation duration
    (Canham, Beesley, et al., 2021; Freestone et al., 2022) with additional measurements
    in the current study. To support the interpretation of species trait values in
    relation to hydrological habitat preferences at a local scale, we assessed dry-season
    plant water availability (using predawn plant water potential; PsiPD), the elevation
    of trees in the landscape and the duration of flood inundation. Plant water potential
    at predawn is widely used as a surrogate for soil water status (Ritchie & Hinckley,
    1975). PsiPD was measured at predawn (between 03:30 and 06:00 h in June 2019) for
    five replicate terminal shoots for each species using a Scholander-type pressure
    chamber (PMS Instruments Model 1000 Pressure Chamber Instrument, Albany, OR, USA).
