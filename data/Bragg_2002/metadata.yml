      description: The vegetation type was fire‐prone, low, open sclerophyll woodland, dominated by woody shrub species, with emergent eucalypt trees up to 9 m tall. The site was last burnt in 1990. The geology of the site is Hawkesbury sandstone, weathering to low nutrient soils (total soil phosphorus 94 mg/kg, Wright, Reich & Westoby 2001). Gap fractions (see below) were mostly in the range 0·3–0·7; the shrub species were growing in dappled light rather than in dense shade with occasional sunflecks.
  sampling_strategy: Twenty‐six abundant, woody, understorey species were selected. Five random individuals of each species within a 31 400 m2 area were sampled. Each measured individual was located at least 20 m from a measured conspecific, and at least 10 m from a track passing through the site.

  methods: Leaf length was measured as the shortest distance from the base of the blade to the apex. For tufts with more than 10 leaves, length was measured for five, and averaged. For each species, length and area were measured for 15 or more leaves taken from plants other than those where tufts were studied.
