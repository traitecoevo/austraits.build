  description: LMA for 6 banksia species
  collection_type: glasshouse
  sample_age_class: sapling
  sampling_strategy: Three- to 5-year-old plants of 10 Banksia species were used (B.
    attenuata R. Br., B. candolleana Meisn., B. elderiana F. Muell. & Tate, B. hookeriana
    Meisn., B. ilicifolia R. Br., B. prionotes Lindl., B. quercifolia R. Br., B. repens
    Labill., B. serrata L.f. and B. victoriae Meisn.). The plants, except for B. serrata,
    were grown from seed under ambient conditions outdoors in 10 L pots containing
    a mixture of river sand and potting mix following their establishment during 2002
    in Perth, Western Australia. About 3 weeks before measurements were taken, the
    plants were transferred to a controlled-temperature greenhouse (23 deg C day/18
    deg C night). Mature plants of B. serrata were purchased from a local nursery
    in Canberra, Australian Capital Territory. Upon purchase, the plants were re-potted
    into 10 L pots containing a mixture of grey sand and potting mix and grown for
    2 months prior to measurement in a greenhouse (25 deg C day/20 deg C night). For
    all measurements described below, youngest fully expanded leaves were used.

  replicates: 3
  methods: Three leaves per species, each leaf originating from a different plant,
    were sampled early in the morning. Leaf area (using a leaf area meter, LI-300A,
    Li-Cor, Lincoln, NE, USA) and leaf dry mass (after drying at 70 deg C for 3 d)
    were measured, and leaf dry matter content, LMA and leaf density (leaf density
    = LMA/LT) were calculated.
- var_in: stomatal number per leaf area (mm-2)
  unit_in: count/mm2
  trait_name: stomatal_density_average
  value_type: experiment_mean
  replicates: 3
  methods: Two leaves per species, each leaf originating from a different plant, were
    collected early in the morning, and immediately analysed with variable pressure
    scanning electron microscopy (VPSEM) and/or cryo-scanning electron microscopy
    (CSEM). Leaves of B. serrata that were used for ESEM were initially frozen in
    liquid nitrogen and then transferred on dry ice from Canberra to Perth (Australia),
    where they were stored at -80 deg C prior to ESEM. For CSEM, the procedure described
    by McCully, Canny & Huang (2004) was followed. Segments of the leaf lamina from
    the middle part of each leaf were removed under liquid nitrogen, mounted on stubs
    with low-temperature Tissue-Tek (O.C.T. Compound cryostat specimen matrix, ProSciTech,
    Thuringowa, Queensland, Australia) and planed flat in the paradermal and transverse
    direction using a diamond knife in a cryo-microtome (Cryo-system Oxford CT1500,
    Oxford Instruments Ltd., Old Station Way, Eynsham,Oxford OX8 1TL, UK) at -100
    deg C. Samples were then etched in the column of the CSEM (Cambridge S360, Cambridge
    Instruments Ltd., Viking Way, Bar Hill, Cambridge, CB3 8EL, UK) for 1-2 min at
    -90 deg C to reveal cell outlines, sputter coated with gold and examined at 15
    kV. Images of top and side views of crypts were captured using Microsoft Photodraw.
    For ESEM, several leaf discs (maximum diameter of 1 cm) were cut from both sides
    of the midrib, sampling both close to and away from the midrib and near the base
    and tip of the leaf. Scanning electron micrographs of the adaxial and abaxial
    surfaces of each leaf disc were obtained using a Philips (Eindhoven, the Netherlands)
    XL30 ESEM at 15 kV. Where abundant pubescence prevented clear identification of
    crypt boundaries, wood glue was applied in small areas of the abaxial leaf surface,
    from which leaf discs would be taken, prior to detachment of the leaf.After 8
    h, the leaf was detached, the hardened wood glue was peeled off and leaf discs
    were prepared for ESEM. At least 33 scanning electron micrographs of different
    regions of each leaf were obtained and used for the quantification of (1) the
    average number of crypts per unit leaf area (crypt density); (2) the number of
    stomata per crypt, and per unit crypt bottom wall surface area; the latter was
    measured at the bottom of the crypts in a portion of the wall that was flat; (3)
    the average aperture area of a crypt, which was obtained by measuring the aperture
    area of 100 crypts per species; (4) stomatal length and interstomatal distance,
    measured at the bottom of the crypt and expressed in stomatal lengths. Stomatal
    number per unit leaf area was estimated from the average stomatal number per crypt
    and the average crypt density. Stomatal characteristics were examined in six species
    (B. attenuata, B. elderiana, B. ilicifolia, B. prionotes, B. quercifolia and B.
    serrata). These analyses were carried out using Image J (Abramoff, Magelhaes &
    Ram 2004).
