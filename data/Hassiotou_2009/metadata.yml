  description: LMA for 6 banksia species
  collection_type: glasshouse
  sample_age_class: sapling
  sampling_strategy: Three- to 5-year-old plants of 10 Banksia species were used (B.
    attenuata R. Br., B. candolleana Meisn., B. elderiana F. Muell. & Tate, B. hookeriana
    Meisn., B. ilicifolia R. Br., B. prionotes Lindl., B. quercifolia R. Br., B. repens
    Labill., B. serrata L.f. and B. victoriae Meisn.). The plants, except for B. serrata,
    were grown from seed under ambient conditions outdoors in 10 L pots containing
    a mixture of river sand and potting mix following their establishment during 2002
    in Perth, Western Australia. About 3 weeks before measurements were taken, the
    plants were transferred to a controlled-temperature greenhouse (23째 C day/18 째C
    night). Mature plants of B. serrata were purchased from a local nursery in Canberra,
    Australian Capital Territory. Upon purchase, the plants were re-potted into 10
    L pots containing a mixture of grey sand and potting mix and grown for 2 months
    prior to measurement in a greenhouse (25 째C day/20 째C night). For all measurements
    described below, youngest fully expanded leaves were used.
