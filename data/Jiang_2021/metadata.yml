  description: A dataset quantifying the variation in plant hydraulic traits of two
    widespread mangrove species growing across a latitudinal gradient to determine
    if intraspecific variation in hydraulic traits may allow a mangrove species to
    acclimate to novel climatic conditions.
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: Field Sites and Plant Materials ^p The mangrove plants were collected
    in three sites along the eastern Australian coastline (Table 1). Five to six healthy,
    mature individuals for each species in each site were sampled from natural populations
    with similar height. The plant heights were 2.5-3.5 m for Avicennia marina, and
    1.5-2 m for Aegiceras corniculatum, and slightly vary across the different sites
    at the population level. Hereafter, only the generic names are used to indicate
    the two species. The samples were collected at Marlow (in New South Wales) between
    July and August of 2017, as well as North Stradbroke Island (in Queensland) in
    June of 2017 and Cape Tribulation (in Queensland) between September and October
    of 2017. The laboratory measurements were conducted at the Hawkesbury Institute
    for the Environment (for the Marlow site, Western Sydney University), Moreton
    Bay Research Station (MBRS, for the North Stradbroke Island site, operated by
    the University of Queensland), and Daintree Rainforest Observatory (DRO, for the
    Cape Tribulation site, operated by James Cook University), to minimize sample
    transportation. Hereafter, Marlow, MBRS, and DRO are used to indicate the three
    sites. Based on the salinity map on the websites of Marine Science Australia and
    the Sea Surface Salinity Remote Sensing Project [44,45], these three sites have
    similar salinity levels at an average annual scale. We also collected seawater
    in Marlow and DRO for testing during the fieldwork on a rainless day. The electrical
    conductivity measurements showed consistent results among sites (data not shown).
    The data of mean annual temperature (MAT), seasonality of precipitation (PS; coefficient
    of variation across monthly measurements x 100), and the minimum monthly precipitation
    of the year (Pmin) were obtained from WorldClim [46]; the aridity index (AI),
    mean annual precipitation (MAP), and potential evapotranspiration (PET) were acquired
    from Ecosystem Modeling and Scaling Infrastructure [47,48] according to the coordinates
    of each site.

  methods: Stem xylem vulnerability to embolism was quantified using the bench dehydration
    method [54]. Five to six individual trees per species in each site were targeted
    from native populations with minimum human impacts. Branches of 1.5-1.7 m long
    (greater than fivefold of the MVL) from each tree were collected in the predawn.
    We used the updated protocol to assess the vulnerability [55,56], avoiding the
    “cutting under tension” artifact. Harvesting the branch segments under xylem tension
    would introduce the risk that air would enter the xylem tissue even if the cuts
    were made underwater, thus the embolism would be overestimated. The targeted branches
    were recut immediately underwater to avoid artificial embolism. The cut end was
    bagged with a small plastic bag which contained moist paper towels and fastened
    by using a rubber band. Black plastic bags with moist paper towels inside were
    used to bag the branches separately and all the plant materials were transported
    to the laboratory as soon as possible. The ends of branches were cut again under
    water and kept immersed. All the branches were moved to a dark room for overnight
    rehydration. ^p The bagged branches were exposed to room temperature for equilibrium
    for at least 1 h and then taken out of the bags. Two healthy, fully expanded,
    mature leaves near the targeted segment were foiled and wrapped by using aluminum
    foil and plastic films. The branches were dried in a laboratory environment to
    reach different water potential ranges, and then were put in black plastic bags
    with humidified paper towels for at least 1 h to equilibrate to reach a homogeneity
    of water stress in the branches. Water potential (WPstem) of foiled, bagged leaves
    was measured using a Scholander-type pressure chamber (Model 1505D; PMS, Albany,
    OR, USA). ^p Once the WPstem was confirmed, the apical end of the target segment
    was cut underwater and rehydrated to release tension. After 20-30 min of rehydration,
    another cut was made at the proximal side to allow the whole segment to sit underwater.
    The segment was recut at both ends repeatedly until an unbranched segment 5-8
    cm in length and 4-6 mm in diameter was obtained. Additionally, 5-10 min intervals
    between each cut were set for fully rehydration. The cut ends of all stem segments
    used for hydraulic measurements were at least 50 cm away (>MVL) from the initial
    cut ends underwater for rehydration. Both ends were trimmed with a fresh razor
    blade to obtain a clear and smooth cutting surface to avoid blockage caused by
    occluded vessel conduits. ^p The stem segment was connected to the hydraulic apparatus
    and a digital liquid flow meter (Liqui-Flow L13-AAD-11-K-10S; Bronkhorst, Ruurlo,
    Netherlands) was used to calculate the flow rate by pressure head (0.003 MPa)
    which was generated by the gravity of a water column. Stem hydraulic conductivity
    was measured before and after stem flushing. The measuring solution and perfusing
    solution were the same as described above in Section 2.2. The segments were flushed
    with a pressure of 0.15 MPa to remove air bubbles for 20 min or until no bubbles
    were observed. The relative difference in flowrate (percentage loss of hydraulic
    conductivity, PLC) before and after flushing was plotted against corresponding
    stem water potential to build stem vulnerability curves. PLC (%) was calculated
    as, PLC=100x(1-KiKm) (1) (Ki, initial conductivity; Km, maximum conductivity after
    flushing). ^p For PLC measurements, pre-flush Ki was compared with the post-flush
    Km of the same segment with all embolism removed [57]. A length of 5-8 cm was
    preferred as it was the maximum length of unbranched stem segment available which
    directly supported the canopy leaves in this study case. This length was less
    than the MVL of the two species and therefore open vessels were present in segments
    used for hydraulic measurements. A relatively low-pressure head of 0.003 MPa was
    applied to avoid pushing gas bubbles from the open vessels present in the segments.
    The pressure was insufficient for removing emboli from open vessels in the studied
    species, based on the measurements of wood anatomy (narrow vessel) and stable
    flowrate (if not, the flowrate should increase during initial flow measurements).
    Therefore, the PLC could be considered as a proportion of the conductivity, and
    the influence of segment sample length could be slight, especially in the case
    where the bench dehydration method was utilized [58].

    flowrate (if not, the flowrate should increase during initial flow measurements).
    Therefore, the PLC could be considered as a proportion of the conductivity, and
    the influence of segment sample length could be slight, especially in the case
    where the bench dehydration method was utilized [58]. ^p The water potential data
    were collected on a third sunny day with no observed rainfall in the previous
    two days.

    and immediately placed into humidified zip seal bags. Samples were put in a cooler
    box and transported to the laboratory within 30 min or measured on-site, using
    the Scholander-type pressure chamber. ^p For midday water potential measurements,
    samples were collected at 12:30-13:30. Particularly, aluminum foils and plastic
    bags were used to bag the leaves at predawn, thus the bagged leaf water potential
    represented the midday stem water potential (WPmd-stem), while the unbagged leaves
    were measured as midday leaf water potential (WPmd-leaf). ^p The water potential
    data were collected on a third sunny day with no observed rainfall in the previous
    two days. The WPmd-stem was considered as minimum stem water potential (WPmin)
    in this study. Thus, two types of hydraulic safety margin (HSM) for stem xylem
    were calculated, HSM50 = WPmin - P50, and HSM88 = WPmin - P88, where P50 and P88
    stand for stem water potential at 50% and 88% loss of conductivity, respectively
    [10,62].

  methods: The same protocol for sample collection was followed and the same individual

    for each species, were collected in the predawn. Stem segments 8-10 cm in length
    and 4-6 mm in diameter were obtained from those long branches. The hydraulic conductivity
    was measured by using fresh samples after flushing to minimize the potential possibility
    of native embolism, and also standardize the data. The cross-sectional area of
    xylem (As) and the leaf area (AL) supported by each stem were measured and used
    to calculate sapwood-specific hydraulic conductivity (Ks) and leaf-specific hydraulic
    conductivity (KL), respectively. The conductive section diameter was measured
    at the proximal end of the sample by using a digital caliper (K11100; Kincrome,
    Scoresby, VIC, Australia). Leaf area was determined using a leaf area meter (Li-3100C;

    area (As) to the projected leaf area (AL). ^p The hydraulic conductivity measured
    using short segments was relatively higher because those segments contained open
    vessels, but was a compromise with measuring hydraulic conductivity in stems of
    similar branching order with similar stem size. The influence of side lateral
    branches was avoided, and the potential wounding effect caused by extended flushing
    time was also reduced [59,60]. Meanwhile, the measurements provided a good basis
    for comparison between sites in this study, and the overestimation of hydraulic
    conductivity should be paid attention when comparing values of Ks and KL reported

    1 m in length, from each tree and a total of three individuals were sampled per
    species per site, in the predawn. The maximum vessel length (MVL, cm) was determined
    using a modified air-injection method [50,51,52]. The branches were flushed basipetally
    to decrease the possibility of overestimation of the MVL. The long branch segments
    were cut underwater and connected with silicon tubing (Cole-Parmer, Vernon Hills,
    IL, USA) and flushed for 2-3 h with degassed, filtered (filter capacity, 0.2 um,
    Millipore, Burlington, MA, USA) solution of ultrapure water containing 2 mM KCl
    and 20 mM NaCl [15] at 0.15 MPa. A perfusing solution with similar ionic makeup
    and concentration to xylem sap minimizes the artifacts in conductivity measurements
    [53]. Then an air compressor pump or a syringe (when measuring in the field) was
    used to apply pressurized air at 0.1 MPa through the distal ends while placing
    the basal ends underwater for 3-5 min at each step. Segments 1 cm long were cut
    off sequentially until a continuous stream of air bubbles was observed. The remaining
    length (from the injection point to the new cut) plus 0.5 cm was considered as
    the MVL.

    was calculated from the diameter of each vessel and the number of total vessels
    [63]. Vessel density (VD) was the average number of vessels per unit area for
    each section. Vessel wall reinforcement (VWR) was determined as, VWR=(2TWD)2 where
    Tw is the thickness of the vessel wall [64]. All parameters were averaged for
