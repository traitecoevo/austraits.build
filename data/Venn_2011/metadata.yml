  description: data for traits from alpine zone from Susanna Venn
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: The study was conducted across seven snowpatches of the Main
    Range in the alpine area of Kosciuszko National Park, Snowy Mountains, south-eastern
    Australia. The region is characterized by continuous snow cover for up to 4 months
    of the year, with the first snowfalls of the season occurring between May and
    June. Snowcover in alpine areas may become discontinuous toward the end of October,
    although large drifts at high altitudes usually persist until mid November. Snowpatches
    on the lee side of the highest ridges can persist into February and occasionally
    later. Maximum snow depths from the nearby weekly-monitored snow course in Australia,
    Spencers Creek, 1,830 m, show high inter-annual variability, ranging between just
    over 360 cm (1981) and 85 cm (2006). However, snow depths in snowpatches can be
    up to 600 cm due to steep topography and snow drifting patterns (Costin et al.
    2000). Temperatures in the Snowy Mountains vary considerably with the seasons;
    minimum temperatures can be below freezing for up to 6 months per year (Costin
    et al. 2000; Venn unpublished data), while maximum temperatures over winter occasionally
    reach 10–13 °C (Venn unpublished data). In the snow-free summer months, maximum
    temperatures can regularly reach 25 °C and overnight temperatures below 0 °C (Venn
    unpublished data). Vegetation types reflect the local topography, aspect, drainage,
    and duration of snow cover (Costin et al. 2000); bog and fen communities are in
    the lower drainage areas, shrublands on the slopes, tall and short alpine herbfield
    on the upper slopes and feldmark on the windswept rocky ridges (Costin et al.
    2000). Highly organic alpine humus soil dominates on all bedrock types and under
    most physiographic conditions (Costin 1954; Good 1992). We collected trait data
    from 10 to 25 mature individuals of each species during the peak of the 2008/2009
    growing season, in nearby locations in similar landscape positions. Trait data,
    including destructive sampling, were not directly measured from plants within
    the study plots. We measured three character-based traits (leaf area, plant height,
    seed mass) for the 40 species recorded in the quadrats across the seven snowpatches.
    We chose these traits based on the individual plant and ecosystem functions in
    which they are involved (Leps et al. 2006; Petchey and Gaston 2006) in the context
    of small-scale plant community dynamics. In addition, these traits are indicative
    of functional characteristics (Mason et al. 2003) and are also directly linked
    to ecosystem functioning.

    with herbarium specimens. For species with very light seeds, 10 or 20 seeds were
    weighed at a time. Mean seed weight for each species was obtained from up to 25

questions:
  question_1: The referenced manuscript does not specify methods of SLA
    and LDMC?
  question_2: Some of the SLA values are very high, the opposite of what is commonly observed in alpine species. Are these values correct?
  question_3: A number of leaf dry matter content values suggest the leaves lost 98% of their weight - is this correct?
  question_4: And a few leaves weigh more dry than wet - is this correct?
