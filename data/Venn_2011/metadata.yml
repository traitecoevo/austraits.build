  description: Study used three continuous plant functional traits (leaf area, plant
    height, seed mass) and their divergence (using the FDvar index) to document current
    patterns of community assembly and predict plant community responses to future
    environmental filters in alpine snowpatch vegetation.
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: The study was conducted across seven snowpatches of the Main
    Range in the alpine area of Kosciuszko National Park, Snowy Mountains, south-eastern
    Australia. The region is characterized by continuous snow cover for up to 4 months
    of the year, with the first snowfalls of the season occurring between May and
    June. Snowcover in alpine areas may become discontinuous toward the end of October,
    although large drifts at high altitudes usually persist until mid November. Snowpatches
    on the lee side of the highest ridges can persist into February and occasionally
    later. Maximum snow depths from the nearby weekly-monitored snow course in Australia,
    Spencers Creek, 1,830 m, show high inter-annual variability, ranging between just
    over 360 cm (1981) and 85 cm (2006). However, snow depths in snowpatches can be
    up to 600 cm due to steep topography and snow drifting patterns (Costin et al.
    2000). Temperatures in the Snowy Mountains vary considerably with the seasons;
    minimum temperatures can be below freezing for up to 6 months per year (Costin
    et al. 2000; Venn unpublished data), while maximum temperatures over winter occasionally
    reach 10-13 deg C (Venn unpublished data). In the snow-free summer months, maximum
    temperatures can regularly reach 25 deg C and overnight temperatures below 0 deg
    C (Venn unpublished data). Vegetation types reflect the local topography, aspect,
    drainage, and duration of snow cover (Costin et al. 2000); bog and fen communities
    are in the lower drainage areas, shrublands on the slopes, tall and short alpine
    herbfield on the upper slopes and feldmark on the windswept rocky ridges (Costin
    et al. 2000). Highly organic alpine humus soil dominates on all bedrock types
    and under most physiographic conditions (Costin 1954; Good 1992). We collected
    trait data from 10 to 25 mature individuals of each species during the peak of
    the 2008/2009 growing season, in nearby locations in similar landscape positions.
    Trait data, including destructive sampling, were not directly measured from plants
    within the study plots. We measured three character-based traits (leaf area, plant
    height, seed mass) for the 40 species recorded in the quadrats across the seven
    snowpatches. We chose these traits based on the individual plant and ecosystem
    functions in which they are involved (Leps et al. 2006; Petchey and Gaston 2006)
    in the context of small-scale plant community dynamics. In addition, these traits
    are indicative of functional characteristics (Mason et al. 2003) and are also
    directly linked to ecosystem functioning. We collected trait data from 10 to 25

traits:
- var_in: MEAN SEED MASS (g)
  unit_in: g
  trait_name: seed_mass
  value_type: multisite_mean
  replicates: 10-25
  methods: We measured mean seed mass (ug) of all snowpatch species using seed freshly
    collected during the growing season of 2008/2009, stored seed, and seed associated
    with herbarium specimens. For species with very light seeds, 10 or 20 seeds were
    weighed at a time. Mean seed weight for each species was obtained from up to 25
    replicate weights where enough seed was available.
- var_in: MEAN LEAF AREA (mm2)
  unit_in: mm2
  trait_name: leaf_area
  value_type: multisite_mean
  replicates: 10-25
  methods: For most species, we collected fresh material from the field during the
    growing season of 2008/2009 and scanned up to 25 adult leaves (collected from
    a minimum of 10 plants) for each species using the Leaf Area Measurement program
    (available from the University of Sheffield, copyright Askew, 2003). Where fresh
    material was unavailable, we used herbarium specimens collected from the study
    region, housed in either the Kosciuszko Herbarium and the Australian National
    Herbarium; these specimens were photocopied or photographed with a scale, and
    leaf area was measured using a digital planimeter on enlarged, printed images.
