  description: trait data from sub-alpine and dry-forest sites in Tasmania
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: We sampled 20 phylogenetically disparate woody angio- sperm species
    from montane rainforest (15 species) and dry sclerophyll forest (five species)
    on the island of Tasmania, in cool temperate Australia (Table 1). Nineteen of
    these species were evergreen, but ranged in their degree of scleromorphy (as reflected
    by leaf mass per unit area, LMA) from 137 g m-2 in the relatively broad leaves
    of the rainforest species Atherosperma moschatum to 772 g m- 2 in the extremely
    scleromorphic needles of Hakea lissosperma (Table 1). The sample group also included
    the winter deciduous species Nothofagus gunnii with LMA = 102 g m-2. One of the
    evergreen species, Tasmannia lanceolata, was vesselless. Climatic limits in terms
    of minimum water availability, as reflected by the fifth percentile of mean annual
    rainfall across each species' distribution, ranged from 351 mm yr-1 for the dry
    forest species Bursaria spinosa to 1268 mm yr-1 for the montane rainforest species
    Orites diversifolia (C. J. Blackman et al., unpublished). These species are known
    to vary widely in leaf xylem vulnerability to hydraulic dysfunction, which, in
    turn, is closely correlated with the estimates of climatic limits for water availability
    described above (C. J. Blackman et al., unpublished).

  methods: WD was measured on five individuals of each species. From each species,
    five 4-cm-long wood samples were taken from 3-5-yr-old stems, as inferred from
    counts of growth rings. The pith and bark were removed from each sample, and fresh
    volume was measured by water displacement. The sample mass was determined after
    drying for at least 3 d at 70C, and WD was calculated as the ratio between oven-
    dried mass and fresh volume (g cm-3).

  replicates: 5-20
  methods: LMA was measured in 5-20 mature, fully expanded, sun-exposed leaves within
    the most recent growth cohort, from five individuals of each species. Leaf areas
    were measured as projected areas with a flatbed scanner and image analysis software
    (Image J; National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA). Leaves were then
    placed in an oven at 70C for at least 3 d, and LMA was calculated as the ratio
    between the dry leaf mass and leaf area.
