  description: trait data from sub-alpine and dry-forest sites in Tasmania
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: We sampled 20 phylogenetically disparate woody angio- sperm species
    from montane rainforest (15 species) and dry sclerophyll forest (five species)
    on the island of Tasmania, in cool temperate Australia (Table 1). Nineteen of
    these species were evergreen, but ranged in their degree of scleromorphy (as reflected
    by leaf mass per unit area, LMA) from 137 g m-2 in the relatively broad leaves
    of the rainforest species Atherosperma moschatum to 772 g m- 2 in the extremely
    scleromorphic needles of Hakea lissosperma (Table 1). The sample group also included
    the winter deciduous species Nothofagus gunnii with LMA = 102 g m-2. One of the
    evergreen species, Tasmannia lanceolata, was vesselless. Climatic limits in terms
    of minimum water availability, as reflected by the fifth percentile of mean annual
    rainfall across each species' distribution, ranged from 351 mm yr-1 for the dry
    forest species Bursaria spinosa to 1268 mm yr-1 for the montane rainforest species
    Orites diversifolia (C. J. Blackman et al., unpublished). These species are known
    to vary widely in leaf xylem vulnerability to hydraulic dysfunction, which, in
    turn, is closely correlated with the estimates of climatic limits for water availability
    described above (C. J. Blackman et al., unpublished).

traits:
- var_in: wood density_g cm3
  unit_in: g/cm3
  trait_name: wood_density
  value_type: site_mean
  replicates: '5'
  methods: WD was measured on five individuals of each species. From each species,
    five 4-cm-long wood samples were taken from 3-5-yr-old stems, as inferred from
    counts of growth rings. The pith and bark were removed from each sample, and fresh
    volume was measured by water displacement. The sample mass was determined after
    drying for at least 3 d at 70C, and WD was calculated as the ratio between oven-
    dried mass and fresh volume (g cm-3).
- var_in: LMA_g m2
  unit_in: g/m2
  trait_name: specific_leaf_area
  value_type: site_mean
  replicates: 5-20
  methods: LMA was measured in 5-20 mature, fully expanded, sun-exposed leaves within
    the most recent growth cohort, from five individuals of each species. Leaf areas
    were measured as projected areas with a flatbed scanner and image analysis software
    (Image J; National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA). Leaves were then
    placed in an oven at 70C for at least 3 d, and LMA was calculated as the ratio
    between the dry leaf mass and leaf area.
- var_in: Kleaf_mmol_m2_s_Mpa
  unit_in: mmol/m2/s/MPa
  trait_name: leaf_hydraulic_conductivity
  value_type: site_mean
  replicates: 3
  methods: For each species, leaf hydraulic vulnerability curves were constructed
    by measuring the percentage loss of leaf hydraulic conductance from maximum values
    (Kmax) in leaves rehydrated from a range of leaf water potentials (Wleaf). For
    the purposes of these curves, Kleaf was measured by assessing the kinetics of
    Wleaf relaxation upon leaf rehydration (Brodribb & Holbrook, 2003). Briefly, hydrated
    branches from three individuals of each species were cut early in the morning
    and immediately bagged to arrest water loss. Having transported them to the laboratory,
    the branches were allowed to desiccate slowly at light intensities sufficient
    to ensure light-induced hydraulic function (c. 50 lmol quanta m)2 s)1) over a
    maximum of 48 h or until the percentage loss of Kleaf approached 100%. Initial
    Wleaf was determined by measuring leaves neighbouring the sample leaf in a Scholander
    pressure chamber (PMS, Albany, OR, USA). The sample leaf was then cut under water
    and allowed to rehydrate for a period of between 30 and 300 s depending on the
    initial Wleaf. Final Wleaf was measured with the pressure chamber, and Kleaf was
    calculated from the ratio of the initial to final Wleaf and the capacitance of
    the leaf
- var_in: leafP50_Mpa
  unit_in: MPa
  trait_name: leaf_hydraulic_vulnerability
  value_type: site_mean
  replicates: 3
  methods: The vulnerability of leaf hydraulic conductance to decreasing water potential
    (P50leaf) for individual species was defined as the WPleaf value at which Kleaf
    had declined by 50% from the mean maximum rate (Kmax) for each species. For each
    species, P50leaf was calculated by fitting a three-parameter sigmoidal regression
    function - see manuscript for details.
- var_in: TLP_Mpa
  unit_in: MPa
  trait_name: leaf_turgor_loss_point
  value_type: site_mean
  replicates: 6
  methods: For each species, one leaf from each of six neighbouring plants was sampled
    for the determination of leaf turgor dynamics from pressure–volume (P–V) analysis
    (Tyree & Hammel, 1972). For species with small leaves or reduced leaf petioles,
    small terminal shoots were sampled. Branches were cut under water in the morning
    and rehydrated until WPleaf was > 0.05 MPa, after which leaves were detached and
    allowed to slowly desiccate on the laboratory bench. During this process, the
    leaf weight (weighed to 0.0001 g) and water potential were measured periodically.
    The turgor loss point (TLP) was determined from the inflection point of the graph
    of 1 /WPleaf vs the relative water content.
