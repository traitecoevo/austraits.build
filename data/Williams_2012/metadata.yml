  description: Study investigating persistence and recruitment of rainforest species
    in wet tropical eucalypt forests under frequent fire regimes.
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult, sapling [by trait]
  sampling_strategy: The study was conducted in the Wet Tropics of northeastern Australia.
    A total of 85 surveys were undertaken across 13 permanent plots over the 14 years.
    The plots were positioned at the eucalypt forest rainforest ecotone, and spread
    across the landscape in an attempt to accommodate any spatial variability in forest
    and fire regime. Each plot contained sufficient grass cover (Themeda triandra
    and/or Imperata cylindrica) at the time of establishment to ensure fires would
    carry across the landscape containing the plots. Six 100 m2 permanently marked,
    repeatedly surveyed monitoring plots were located across a 5 km area at the Wallaman
    Falls section of Girringun National Park (18.600 deg S; 145.804 deg E), approximately
    50 km west of Ingham. Seven 100 m2 plots were located across a 30 km area in the
    Paluma area within the Australian Wildlife Conservancy's Taravale Mt Zero Sanctuary
    and adjacent Paluma Range National Park (19.039 deg S; 146.132 deg E), approximately
    70 km northwest of Townsville. Repeated surveys of plots over many years, rather
    than a single large survey of sites with different fire histories, accommodate
    inherent spatial variation, document species change over time and, most importantly,
    allow plant regeneration observations after multiple fires (Lonsdale & Braithwaite
    1991; Russell Smith et al. 2003). With the exception of a high severity wildfire
    in 2003, which was documented in one plot (Taravale/Paluma 6), all fires were
    purposely lit as part of a regular prescribed burning programme across the landscape.
    The burns varied in intensity across plots and over years. While no fire intensity
    measurements were made, the fires were of sufficient intensity to scorch crowns
    of 4 to 8 m tall saplings. The prescribed fires were considered of a moderate
    intensity, in comparison to wet tropical eucalypt forest fires witnessed by the
    authors over the years, being less severe than the wildfires during the 2002/3
    drought, but of sufficient intensity to travel at walking speed through the forest
    understorey. Each plot was burnt between 0 to 5 times, and surveyed 2 to 10 times
    over 5 to 14 years during the period 1996 to 2009 (see Appendix S1). During each
    survey, all individuals of shrubs and tree species, both sclerophyll and rainforest,
    were counted, including newly emerged seedlings. The mode of plant regeneration
    was documented by distinguishing recently germinated seedlings from existing plants
    and whether post fire resprouting originated from along subsoil roots, at the
    base of stems or epicormically from branches and trunks above ground level.

    fire history: Plots were burnt between 0 to 5 times between 1996 and 2009 by prescribed
      fires of varying intensity, with the exception of a high severity wildfire in
      2003, which was documented in one plot. Refer to supplementary information on
      fires in the raw data folder.
    georeference remarks: Although only a single latitude/longitude can be reported,
      the repeatedly surveyed plots were conducted at two locations, the Wallaman
      Falls section of Girringun National Park (18.600 deg S; 145.804 deg E) and in
      the Paluma area within the Australian Wildlife Conservancy's Taravale-Mt Zero
      Sanctuary and adjacent Paluma Range National Park (19.039 deg S; 146.132 deg
      E).
