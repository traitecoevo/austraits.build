  description: A study testing predictions regarding rainforest seedling recruitment
    and post-fire regenerative capacity of rainforest species using 14 years of data
    collected across 13 plots with different fire histories in the Wet Tropics of
    north-eastern Australia.
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: The study was conducted in the Wet Tropics of northeastern Australia.
    A total of 85 surveys were undertaken across 13 permanent plots over the 14 years.
    The plots were positioned at the eucalypt forest rainforest ecotone, and spread
    across the landscape in an attempt to accommodate any spatial variability in forest
    and fire regime. Each plot contained sufficient grass cover (Themeda triandra
    and/or Imperata cylindrica) at the time of establishment to ensure fires would
    carry across the landscape containing the plots. Six 100 m2 permanently marked,
    repeatedly surveyed monitoring plots were located across a 5 km area at the Wallaman
    Falls section of Girringun National Park (18.600 deg S; 145.804 deg E), approximately
    50 km west of Ingham. Seven 100 m2 plots were located across a 30 km area in the
    Paluma area within the Australian Wildlife Conservancy's Taravale Mt Zero Sanctuary
    and adjacent Paluma Range National Park (19.039 deg S; 146.132 deg E), approximately
    70 km northwest of Townsville. Repeated surveys of plots over many years, rather
    than a single large survey of sites with different fire histories, accommodate
    inherent spatial variation, document species change over time and, most importantly,
    allow plant regeneration observations after multiple fires (Lonsdale & Braithwaite
    1991; Russell Smith et al. 2003). With the exception of a high severity wildfire
    in 2003, which was documented in one plot (Taravale/Paluma 6), all fires were
    purposely lit as part of a regular prescribed burning programme across the landscape.
    The burns varied in intensity across plots and over years. While no fire intensity
    measurements were made, the fires were of sufficient intensity to scorch crowns
    of 4 to 8 m tall saplings. The prescribed fires were considered of a moderate
    intensity, in comparison to wet tropical eucalypt forest fires witnessed by the
    authors over the years, being less severe than the wildfires during the 2002/3
    drought, but of sufficient intensity to travel at walking speed through the forest
    understorey. Each plot was burnt between 0 to 5 times, and surveyed 2 to 10 times
    over 5 to 14 years during the period 1996 to 2009 (see Appendix S1). During each
    survey, all individuals of shrubs and tree species, both sclerophyll and rainforest,
    were counted, including newly emerged seedlings. The mode of plant regeneration
    was documented by distinguishing recently germinated seedlings from existing plants
    and whether post fire resprouting originated from along subsoil roots, at the
    base of stems or epicormically from branches and trunks above ground level. ^p
    The timing of rainforest recruitment ^p Data of recently emerged seedlings from
    all 85 surveys of the 13 plots were combined to examine the timing of seedling
    recruitment with respect to years since fire. The numbers of newly emerged seedlings
    per plot, documented during each of the 85 plot surveys, were used as replicates
    in the analysis. Rainforest seedling density was compared with seedling density
    of open eucalypt forest, sclerophyll species. A two-factor analysis of variance
    was used to test for significance of differences, with years since fire of the
    survey (1, 2, 3 and >3 years) and type of species (rainforest or eucalypt forest)
    as the two factors. Seedling data were log(x + 1) transformed prior to analysis.
    ^p The pattern of seedling survival of the most abundantly germinating sclerophyll
    (Acacia cincinnata) and rainforest species (Alphitonia petrei) was examined graphically.
    ^p The effect of frequent fire on plant density ^p The effect of frequent burning
    on the persistence of rainforest and eucalypt forest sclerophyll species was evaluated
    through several analyses. An analysis of covariance used plant density data to
    evaluate whether the number of fires affected plant density. The 13 plots were
    grouped into three fire categories, low (plots that experienced 0 or 1 fire over
    the study, 5 plots in total); medium (experienced 2 fires, 5 plots); and high
    (experienced 5 fires, 3 plots). The analysis of covariance compared the density
    of sclerophyll and rainforest plants documented during the last survey of each
    plot, and used the plant density in the initial survey of that plot as a covariate.
    In this way, the analysis of covariance evaluated change over time in plant density
    with different numbers of fires. ^p A repeated measures analysis of variance was
    used to test for a fire frequency effect on total plant density for the five plots
    at Wallaman (Wallaman 1-5) that spanned the full 14-year study. This analysis
    used eight levels of the repeated factor 'year of survey' and two fire regime
    levels (burnt once and burnt five times). ^p A further analysis of covariance
    was undertaken on the three Wallaman Falls plots burnt five times, to test whether
    there was any difference in the density of sclerophyll plants compared with rainforest
    plants following a decade of frequent fire.
