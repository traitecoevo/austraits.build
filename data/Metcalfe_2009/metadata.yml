  description: Part of a worldwide dataset that explores how land-use change impacts
    these attributes in plant communities, using data from 18 land-use intensity gradients
    that represent five biomes and > 2800 species. We identify functional groups using
    multivariate analysis of plant traits which influence ecosystem processes.
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: This data is one of 18 datasets worldwide used in the manuscript.
    Datasets were used for the analyses if they included a survey of plant communities
    within a well-defined local geographic region, across plots representing a gradient
    of at least three land-use intensities relevant to that landscape (Table S2),
    e.g. from primary rainforest to logged sites or shifting cultivation fallows,
    or from ungrazed sub-alpine grasslands to heavily fertilized and grazed sites,
    and had equal sampling at each plot. Land-use intensity was ranked on an ordinal
    scale specific to each landscape according to the intensity and/or frequency of
    disturbance (i.e. biomass removal) and external inputs (e.g. fertilizer). Vegetation
    was surveyed in 1-24 plots per land-use intensity, depending on the study (Table
    S2). Within each study, standardized sampling methods were used to ensure consistent
    sampling of all plots. The vegetation surveys included all vascular terrestrial
    species.

  notes: In order to link these data with the sites sampled, each species was matched
    to the site name of the first site where it is present, by sequentially cycling
    through sites number 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2, 3.1, 3.2, 4.2, 5.2. However the presence/absence
    data shows that most species are present on more than one site.
