  description: Plant growth form data extracted from the NT Flora Online
  basis_of_record: literature
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: This dataset is sourced from the online NT Flora (version
    date 2022-05-06). Briefly, the textual descriptions of each taxon in were downloaded
    and organised into a tabular format of individual taxon names and their corresponding
    text using R coding script. Sentences and phrases were categorised using a large
    glossary of botanical terminology as referring to one of the following, the entire
    organism, stem, leaf, flower, fruit/seed, roots and environment/habitat. Key terms
    corresponding to trait values in AusTraits were then extracted from these smaller
    chunks of text using a reference table containing a) the AusTraits trait name,
    b) the AusTraits trait value and c) terms to search for in the text. The resulting
    traits were then checked manually using a subset of ~500 taxa to search for errors
    and update the reference table and coding script accordingly. The process was
    repeated iteratively to remove any wrongly classified trait values and to ensure
    as many correct trait values as possible were captured using the algorithm. For
    some traits such as plant_growth_form and life_history, unclassified taxa were
    inferred as possessing a trait value from a higher-level taxonomic description
    e.g. all taxa in the Amyema genus were classified as stem_parasitic, which was
    mentioned only in the genus description. Specific to the plant_growth_form trait,
    any taxon without a growth form and that was described as annual, biennial or
    perennial was inferred as herbaceous.
