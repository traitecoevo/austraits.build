  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: Observers walked along a path through the forest, or on a bearing
    within the understorey, making records for one individual of each species of monocot
    tested using the first individual encountered within 2 m of the centre of the
    path (or the bearing) until all had been covered. Records were then made for the
    next individual of each species encountered regardless of order until all species
    had been sampled for a second time. This procedure was followed until ten individuals
    of each study species had been recorded.

traits:
- var_in: SLA (cm2/g)
  unit_in: cm2/mg
  trait_name: specific_leaf_area
  value_type: site_mean
  replicates: 10
  methods: Fully expanded and toughened leaves were used; those used for LMA and N
    determinations were put into an oven for about 24 h within about 6 h of collection
    from the parent plant. LMA was calculated using leaf areas determined with a Delta-T
    leaf area meter and cut-out outlines of leaves.
- var_in: Nmass (mg g-1)
  unit_in: mg/g
  trait_name: leaf_N_per_dry_mass
  value_type: site_mean
  replicates: 3
  methods: Fully expanded and toughened leaves were used; those used for LMA and N
    determinations were put into an oven for about 24 h within about 6 h of collection
    from the parent plant. LMA was calculated using leaf areas determined with a Delta-T
    leaf area meter and cut-out outlines of leaves. The total nitrogen concentration
    was determined using an automated Kjeldahl method in Cambridge, UK; as a check
    samples of a well-mixed leaf powder for which Dr E. V. J. Tanner had obtained
    analyses from a number of laboratories were included in the analyses.
- var_in: Water concentration per unit dry mass (g g-1)
  unit_in: g/g
  trait_name: leaf_water_content_per_dry_mass
  value_type: site_mean
  replicates: 3
  methods: Water concentration at saturation was determined on leaves left to hydrate
    overnight in a saturated atmosphere with their bases in liquid water. In each
    case, three replicates were used to obtain a mean value unless indicated otherwise.
