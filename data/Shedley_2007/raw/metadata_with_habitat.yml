  description: Report that presents the current knowledge about biodiversity values
    in the Avon Wheatbelt and aspects of their conservation with respect to fire management.
  basis_of_record: literature field
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: This report has presented the current knowledge about biodiversity
    values in the Avon Wheatbelt and aspects of their conservation with respect to
    fire management. A basic structure and process has been recommended for implementing
    and monitoring fire management for biodiversity conservation as a priority. This
    is based on using Beard- Hopkins vegetation associations as the basic fire planning
    unit and developing a GIS spatial database to identify areas available for burning.
    Fire management for biodiversity conservation needs to be considered in association
    with priorities for community protection as detailed in the associated Wildfire
    Threat Analysis report. Additional details available in the report.

  methods: The 9 broad vegetation structural classes referred to in Section 7.2 of
    Part One are listed in Table 1.1 and described in the following sections. These
    classes have been developed for the fire management Guidelines and combine various
    vegetation associations with similar structural characteristics and dominant species.
    They are based on the Beard-Hopkins pre- European vegetation association mapping
    for the area (Beard, 1979 - 1981; Shepherd et al., 2002). The areas refer to that
    contained within the Avon Catchment Council NRM boundary and used in the ArcGIS
    project developed for this project. Intersections were made with the Beard-Hopkins
    pre-European vegetation association mapping and the DEC corporate remnant vegetation
    GIS layer. The vegetation class descriptions in Table 1.1 refer to the dominant
    stratum in terms of height and foliage cover but may contain a wide variety of
    other species in understorey strata, 1) woodland, Single stems tall Eucalyptus
    trees with crowns slightly separated; 2) low_woodland, Single stems medium Eucalyptus,
    Banksia, Acacia or Allocasuarina trees with crowns slightly separated; 3) mallee
    shrubland, Multi-stemmed Eucalyptus with tall shrubs and crowns touching; 4) shrubland,
    Dense thickets or shrubland of Acacia, Melaleuca and Allocasuarina, separately
    or together; 5) shrub heath, Tall and low shrubs of mixed species; 6) Succulent
    Steppe, Saltbush and samphire saline flats; 7) mosaic, Heterogenous mixtures of
    various structural classes; 8) rock outcrops, Mostly bare areas with granite or
    greenstone outcrops and sparse vegetation; 9) salt lakes and wetlands, Mostly
    bare areas covered by salt lakes and clay pans.
