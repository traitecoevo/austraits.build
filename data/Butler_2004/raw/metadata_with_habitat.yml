  description: A study of the evolutionary interactions between seed-dispersal syndromes,
    life-forms, seed size, and habitat characteristics based on the association of
    traits with the regional-scale distributions of subtropical rain-forest plants
    in the context of climatic gradients.
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: The 250 rain-forest sites included in this study covered the
    climatic range of rain forests in the study area, excepting a distinctive cool
    temperate type known as Microphyll Fern Forest that only occurs in the far south
    of the study area. The sites ranged in average annual rainfall from c. 670 mm
    to 2670 mm, and in altitude from near sea level to 1120 m above it. The majority
    of the site data (151 sites) were published in an atlas of the rain-forest plants
    in south-east Queensland (Forster et al., 1991). This data set provided plotless
    inventories of vascular plant species, predominantly from intact stands outside
    south-east Queensland's larger rain-forest reserves. An additional 99 previously
    unpublished inventories of 0.1-ha sites were included from these larger rain-forest
    areas, including the Lamington Plateau, the Main Range, Cooloola (including Fraser
    Island), the Conondale Ranges and Mt Glorious. In order to avoid doubling up when
    the two data sets were combined, one of any pair of sites < 1 km from another
    was excluded. Altitudes and distances from the coast were derived for each site
    using a digital elevation model and coastline. Precipitation, temperature and
    evaporation variables were estimated for the sites using esoclim (Busby, 1986).
    ^p All native woody species recorded in the site inventories were included in
    the comparative data set, with the exception of 65 species considered to be 'ecotonal'.
    The final data set included 568 species in 287 genera, 82 families and 41 orders;
    species nomenclature follows Henderson (2002). ^p Numerical classification was
    used to divide the sites into six floristic site-groups (Table 1). Classification
    was based on presence/absence data for 495 species that occurred in at least three
    sites, and performed using twinspan (Hill, 1979a), a divisive hierarchical classification
    algorithm for two-way indicator species analysis. Ordination (detrended correspondence
    analysis - DCA -Hill, 1979b) was used to decide where to truncate the classification
    and to examine the relationships between floristic site-groups; however, the results
    of these analyses are not presented. The first division in the floristic classification
    separated sites in humid coastal and upland rain forests (floristic site-groups
    1, 2 and 3) from sites in drier coastal rain forests and low-altitude sites inland
    (floristic site-groups 4, 5 and 6). Average annual rainfall was very strongly
    correlated with the first axis in the ordination (Spearman's R = 0.81, P < 0.0001).
    Within the wetter half of the classification, sites from Cooloola (including Fraser
    Island, floristic site-group 1, Fig. 1) were next separated from other humid rain
    forests in floristic site-groups 2 and 3. This division was very clear in the
    ordination, reflecting the exceptional floristic character of the Cooloola forests.
    The second division within the wetter half of the classification separated cool
    subtropical sites on the major highlands of the McPherson and Conondale ranges
    (floristic site-group 2) from a group including wet forests on the coastal lowlands
    and ranges around Nambour and high-altitude sites on the Main Range (floristic
    site-group 3). ^p The drier side of the classification also included three floristic
    site-groups (floristic site-groups 4, 5 and 6). Floristic site-group 4 was composed
    predominantly of Araucarian Notophyll Vine forests (Webb, 1959) from the footslopes
    of the McPherson, Dawes and Main ranges, the hills north of the Conondale Ranges,
    and 'coastal' lowlands south of Hervey Bay (except for the area between Caloundra
    and Gympie). Floristic site-groups 5 and 6 were predominantly composed of drier
    rain forests farther inland. Drier rain forests in the Upper Logan, Bremer, Brisbane
    and southern Burnett river valleys (floristic site-group 5) were closely related
    to dry rain forest in the dry coastal corridor from the Kilkivan district north
    to the coast around Gladstone (floristic site-group 6).

  methods: Dispersal syndromes were assigned for 566 species, based on fruit and seed
    ornamentation and appendages. The three syndromes used in this study are broad
    but robust intuitive classes based upon readily observable characters. Fleshy
    fruited species, which offer a succulent reward for consumers, fitting the vertebrate
    dispersal syndrome, were classed as fleshy (69%). Species with wings or plumes
    on their fruit or seeds were classed as wind-assisted (14%), and species lacking
    the modifications pertaining to the other two categories, and therefore fitting
    the unassisted dispersal syndrome, were classed as unadorned (13%). Most species
    in the unadorned class produce dry and dull-coloured capsules or pods, and some
    species in this class produce explosively dehiscent fruit, particularly in the
    Euphorbiaceae. Species that present fruit or seeds that vertebrate animals may
    find interesting owing to their colourful and often glossy appearance but that
    lack any apparent succulent reward for consumers other than the seeds themselves
    were separated into an 'enticing but unrewarding' class (3.5%). These species
    and three with adhesive fruit (0.5%) were not included in analyses involving dispersal
    syndromes.

- var_in: Life form
  unit_in: .na
  trait_name: plant_growth_form
  entity_type: species
  value_type: mode
  basis_of_value: expert_score
  replicates: .na
  methods: Five hundred and sixty-eight species were placed within four life-form
    classes, trees (34%), shrubs and small trees (45%), robust climbers (8%), and
    slender or shrubby climbers (13%). Mature trees occupy the midstorey to emergent
    layer, whereas mature shrubs and small trees occupy the understorey to midstorey.
    This distinction is increasingly difficult to apply as canopy depth and height
    decrease towards the dry end of the rain-forest structural spectrum. The upper
    height limit for shrubs and small trees is between 14 and 18 m in tall forest
    types, and between 4 and 8 m in drier communities. Species designated as robust
    climbers were woody lianes that tend to mature with most of their foliage in the
    canopy. More slender climbers and scandent, shrubby species were classed together
    as slender or shrubby climbers.
- var_in: Habitat class
  unit_in: .na
  trait_name: .na
  entity_type: species
  value_type: mode
  basis_of_value: expert_score
  replicates: .na
  methods: The distributions of species across sites in the six floristic site-groups
    described above were used to define seven habitat classes for species. Species
    present in at least 10% of sites in at least five of the six floristic site-groups
    were classed as 'widespread'. All other species were assigned to habitat classes
    numbered one to six, based on the floristic site-group within which they had their
    greatest frequency. The floristic site groups were, 1. Warm humid subtropical
    (Cooloola and Fraser Island); 2. Cool humid subtropical (McPherson and Conondale
    Ranges); 3. Slightly drier or warmer than 2 (Nambour and Main Range); 4. Drier
    coastal lowland rain forest; 5. Southern inland dry rain forest; 6. Northern dry
    rain forest
- var_in: Seed diameter (mm)
  unit_in: mm
  trait_name: seed_width
  entity_type: species
  value_type: mean
  basis_of_value: measurement
  replicates: .na
  methods: Seed diameter, defined as the largest diameter perpendicular to the longest
    axis of a seed, was used as an index of seed size. Diameter was estimated for
    551 species, mainly from published descriptions, and was sometimes estimated from
    descriptions of seed length by taking account of the described seed shape. This
    method was considered sufficiently accurate to provide a useful index of seed
    size given the very large range and large average of seed diameter in the rain-forest
    flora (few rain-forest seeds are smaller than 1 mm diameter, and the majority
    are in the range from 2 to 8 mm, with some as large as 40 mm in diameter). The
    seed size of many species is also frequently quite variable (Michaels et al.,
    1988).
