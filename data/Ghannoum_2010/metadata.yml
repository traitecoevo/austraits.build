  description: In this study, we investigated the growth and physiological responses
    of two Eucalyptus species, representing two different growth habits (i.e. slower-growing
    E. sideroxylon and faster-growing E. saligna), to past and future climates. Specifically,
    we assessed the main and interactive effects of air temperature (ambient and ambient
    14 1C) and atmospheric [CO2] (subambient, ambient, and elevated) on biomass production
    and photosynthesis.
  collection_type: glasshouse
  sample_age_class: seedling
  sampling_strategy: 'Soil was collected from the A horizon (top 50 cm) of an experimental
    site located on the grounds of the University of Western Sydney, Richmond, NSW,
    Australia. The soil is a loamy-sand with low organic matter content (0.7%), fertility
    [pH 5.5, N (o1mgkg 1), P (8mgkg 1), K (0.23 mEq/100 g), Ca (1.2 mEq/100 g), Mg
    (0.34 mEq/100 g), S (5mg kg 1), B (0.2mgkg 1), Zn (0.9mgkg 1), Cu (0.2mgkg 1),
    Fe (24mgkg 1), Mn (9.1mgkg 1), Al (0.14 mEq/100 g), Na (0.1 mEq/100 g) and Cl
    (13mgkg 1)] and low water holding capacity. The soil was air dried, and then 9
    kg of dry soil was added to each of 324 cylindrical pots (PVC pipes, 15 cm diameter
    40 cm length), which were adjusted to the same mass by the addition of pebbles.
    Pots were then transferred to six adjacent, naturally lit and temperature-controlled
    glasshouse compartments (3.0 5.0 3.5m3, w l h each). Three glasshouse compartments
    were programmed to simulate the daily temperature of a 30-year average of a local
    (Richmond, NSW) day for the months of November to May (i.e. ambient temperature
    treatment). Three glasshouse compartments were programmed to simulate a constant
    4 1C step increase in temperature (i.e. high temperature treatment) relative to
    the ambient temperature treatment. Air temperature was continually adjusted by
    the temperature-control system and monitored using thermocouples; Tinytags data
    loggers (TinyView, Gemini Data Loggers Ltd., Chichester, UK) were used to additionally
    assess temperature in the glasshouse. The average growing season temperatures
    for the ambient and high temperature treatments were 26/18 and 30/22 1C (day/night),
    respectively. Within each temperature treatment, plants were grown at subambient
    [CO2] (target 280 mLL 1), ambient [CO2] (target 400 mLL 1), and elevated [CO2]
    (target 640 mLL 1). Subambient [CO2] was achieved by continuously passing compartment
    air over trays filled with calcium hydroxide (Schaefer Kalk GmbH & Co KG, Diez,
    Germany) within metal boxes fitted with fans (Thermoline Scientific, Sydney, Australia);
    calcium hydroxide was stirred daily and exchanged twice a week. Elevated [CO2]
    was achieved by injecting CO2 gas (Food grade, AirLiquide, Australia) from pressurized
    cylinders through solenoid valves connected to a CO2 monitor/controller (Lambda
    T, ADC BioScientific Ltd., Hoddesdon, Herts, UK). CO2 was first passed through
    a Purafils column to eliminate possible ethylene contamination. [CO2] was continuously
    monitored in all growth compartments by logging the voltage output of the CO2
    monitors/controllers using a data logger (DL2e, Delta-T Devices Ltd, Cambridge,
    UK). The CO2 monitors/controllers were calibrated at regular intervals with pure
    N2 and two CO2 calibration gases (406   12 and 714   16 mLL 1) (AirLiquide, Australia).
    The average daytime [CO2] during the experimental period for the subambient, ambient
    and elevated treatments was 290, 400, and 650 mLL 1, respectively. Monitored using
    Tinytags data loggers (TinyView, Gemini Data Loggers Ltd., Chichester, UK), relative
    humidity averaged 70% over the growing season and was not significantly different
    between the [CO2] and temperature treatments. Peak mid-day photosynthetic active
    radiation (PAR) was measured by a nearby (1km away) weather station and averaged
    1250 mmolm 2 s 1 over the growing period, reaching a maximum of 2360 mmolm 2 s
    1; glasshouse structure attenuated direct sunlight ca. 10-15%. Plant culture and
    growth measurements Seeds of Sydney blue gum (Eucalyptus saligna Sm.) and red
    ironbark (Eucalyptus sideroxylon A. Cunn. exWoolls) were obtained from Ensis (Australian
    Tree Seed Centre, ACT, Australia). E. saligna and E. sideroxylon seeds were collected
    from NSW at latitudes of 3013400300S and 3215900700S, longitudes of 15210804600E
    and 14715300700E and altitudes of 1012 and 300 m, respectively. The seeds were
    sown (mid-October 2007) in trays filled with seed raising mix (Plugger Custom,
    Debco Pty Ltd., Berkshire Park, NSW, Australia) and placed in temperature-controlled
    germination cabinets maintained at ambient [CO2]. A month later, seedlings were
    transplanted by placing a plug, containing two to six seedlings (each with two
    to four unfolded leaves) in the middle of each pot. There were 27 pots of each
    species in each of the six [CO2] and temperature treatment combinations. In early
    January 2008, seedlings were thinned to one seedling per pot for all treatments;
    at this stage, seedlings were 3-10cm in height, depending on the species and treatments.
    Tree seedlings were watered on a daily basis. On three occasions, 30, 120 and
    135 days after planting (DAP), pots were irrigated with a nutrient solution containing
    a commercial fertilizer (General Purpose, Thrive Professional, Yates Australia)
    at a concentration of 0.2 gNL 1 (N : P :K: S : Fe :Mn: B 25 : 4.1 : 17.3 : 1.6
    : 0.06 : 0.003 : 0.022%). Pots were routinely moved within the glasshouses during
    the experimental period. Two destructive harvests were conducted 80 and 150 DAP;
    nine trees at 80 DAP and 18 trees at 150 DAP of each species were harvested within
    each [CO2] and temperature treatment combination.'

  methods: Net photosynthesis at saturating light (Asat), stomatal conductance (gs)
    and ratio of intercellular to ambient [CO2] (Ci/Ca) were measured at 110 DAP on
    attached,recently fully expanded leaves using a portable open gas exchange system
    (LI-6400, LI-COR). Measurements were conducted at saturating light (photosynthetic
    photon flux density of 1200 mmolm-2 s-1 supplied by an in-built red/blue light-emitting
    diode source), target growth [CO2] (280, 400 or 640 mLL-1), mid-day growth temperature
    (28 or 32 deg C), and ambient leaf-to-air vapour pressure deficit (varied between
    0.9 and 2.0 kPa). Each leaf was allowed 5-10 min to equilibrate before Asat, gs
    and Ci/Ca were measured. There were five replicate measurements per species and
    treatment.

  methods: Two destructive harvests were conducted 80 and 150 DAP; nine trees at 80
    DAP and 18 trees at 150 DAP of each species were harvested within each [CO2] and
    temperature treatment combination. During each harvest, we measured the length
    of the main stem, diameter at stem base, and separated the seedling into stems
    (including branches and petioles) and leaf blades; shoot tips were removed separately
    and roots were washed free of soil. Total leaf area was determined using a portable
    leaf area meter (LI-3100A, LI-COR, Lincoln, NE, USA). The number of leaves and
    branches were counted at 150 DAP harvest only. Harvested samples were oven-dried
    at 80 deg C for 48 h, then weighed. For each plant, mean leaf mass per area (LMA)
    and leaf area ratio (LAR) were calculated as total leaf dry mass/total leaf area
    and total leaf area/total plant dry mass, respectively.
