    species and weighed after drying to constant weight at 95°C.

  methods: The analyses of the plant material were all made after a wet digestion
    by the three acids, sulphuric, nitric, and perchloric, as described by Piper (1944,
    pp. 272-5). The digestion of the resinous species of the heath proved rather difficult.
    At least two additions of nitric and sometimes of perchloric acid had to be made
    to ensure the complete oxidation of the material. Other material, such as Hibbertia
    spp., contained high concentrations of silica (up to 5 per cent.) which was left
    as a sludge in the digest and on the Kjeldahl flask. To minimize adsorption of
    other compounds on this sludge, the digest, diluted with distilled water, was
    boiled gently for some time. Tops of all plants were harvested from the above
    quadrats, separated into species and weighed after drying to constant weight at
    95°C. Bulked sample.
