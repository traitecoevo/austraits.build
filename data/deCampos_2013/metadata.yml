  description: In the present study, we hypothesized that there is an inverse relationship
    between a species' capacity to downregulate its P-uptake capacity and its P-resorption
    efficiency and proficiency. Our hypothesis is that Banksia attenuata and B. menziesii
    (Proteaceae) will not be able to downregulate their P-uptake capacity significantly,
    and hence accumulate P in their leaves and show symptoms of P toxicity. On the
    other hand, they are expected to have a very high P-resorption efficiency and
    withdraw P from senescing leaves to an extremely low level (high proficiency).
    In contrast, we expect Acacia truncata and A. xanthina (Fabaceae) to be able to
    downregulate their P-uptake capacitystrongly, but to be less efficient and proficient
    at P resorption.

  sampling_strategy: Four Australian native species (Banksia attenuata, B. menziesii,
    Acacia truncata and A. xanthina) were grown in a greenhouse in nutrient solutions
    at a range of P concentrations [P]. Acacia plants received between 0 and 500 mM
    P; Banksia plants received between 0 and 10 mM P, to avoid major P-toxicity symptoms
    in these highly P-sensitive species. We measured P uptake at a standard [P] for
    plants of all four species grown at a range of P supplies in a glasshouse. We
    also measured the [P] in fully mature and recently senesced leaves on plants of
    the same species growing in their natural habitat.

  methods: To calculate the leaf [P], all individuals had their leaves dried, ground
    using a mortar and pestle, and homogenized. They were then subjected to a nitric
    - perchloric acid digestion, diluted and analysed using the malachite green method
    (Motomizu et al., 1983).

  methods: The P-resorption efficiency was calculated as the difference between mature
    and senesced leaf [P] divided by mature leaf [P]. Phosphorus-resorption proficiency,
    or the amount of P present in the senesced leaves, was also determined.
