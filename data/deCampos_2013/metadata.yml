  description: A study that investigates if there is an inverse relationship between
    a species' capacity to downregulate its P-uptake capacity and its P-resorption
    efficiency and proficiency.
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: To calculate the P-resorption proficiency of B. attenuata, B.
    menziesii, A. truncata, A. xanthina, Grevillea crithmifolia and Hakea prostrata,
    both fully expanded leaves (green, mature and not visibly damaged) and recently
    senesced leaves (either completely dry but still on the plant or on the top layer
    of litter) were collected in Bold Park (31.95 °S, 115.77 °E), a native bushland
    in the Perth metropolitan area. Samples from field specimens had to be collected
    for these analyses because the leaves of these slow-growing species live for ≥2
    years, and hence experimental plants had no senescing leaves at the end of the
    study. In addition to those four species, samples of Hakea prostrata (Bold Park,
    Western Australia), Acacia suaveolens and Banksia serrata (Blue Mountains National
    Park, New South Wales, Australia) were collected and analysed. Three replicates
    of both mature and senesced leaves were taken for each species (each replicate
    was from a separate shrub or tree no closer than 5 m to one another). Each replicate
    consisted of leaves taken from various points of the same plant. Leaves were gently
    brushed to remove sand and dust and then dried in an oven over 3 d at 60 °C. The
    dried material was ground using a mortar and pestle, digested with nitric and
    perchloric acid, and then analysed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry
    (ICP-OES, model Optima 7300 DV, Perkin Elmer, MA, USA).
  original_file: none, data extracted from paper
  notes: Data extracted from paper, not raw data. There is also experimental data
    in this study looking at how seedling growth varies with nutrient availability,
    but only the field-collected nutrient content data have been included at this
    point.

  methods: To calculate the leaf [P], all individuals had their leaves dried, ground
    using a mortar and pestle, and homogenized. They were then subjected to a nitric
    - perchloric acid digestion, diluted and analysed using the malachite green method
    (Motomizu et al., 1983).

  methods: The P-resorption efficiency was calculated as the difference between mature
    and senesced leaf [P] divided by mature leaf [P]. Phosphorus-resorption proficiency,
    or the amount of P present in the senesced leaves, was also determined. To calculate
    the P-resorption proficiency of B. attenuata, B. menziesii, A. truncata, A. xanthina,
    Grevillea crithmifolia and Hakea prostrata, both fully expanded leaves (green,
    mature and not visibly damaged) and recently senesced leaves (either completely
    dry but still on the plant or on the top layer of litter) were collected in Bold
    Park (31.95 °S, 115.77 °E), a native bushland in the Perth metropolitan area.
    Samples from field specimens had to be collected for these analyses because the
    leaves of these slow-growing species live for ≥2 years, and hence experimental
    plants had no senescing leaves at the end of the study. In addition to those four
    species, samples of Hakea prostrata (Bold Park, Western Australia), Acacia suaveolens
    and Banksia serrata (Blue Mountains National Park, New South Wales, Australia)
    were collected and analysed. Three replicates of both mature and senesced leaves
    were taken for each species (each replicate was from a separate shrub or tree
    no closer than 5 m to one another). Each replicate consisted of leaves taken from
    various points of the same plant. Leaves were gently brushed to remove sand and
    dust and then dried in an oven over 3 d at 60 °C. The dried material was ground
    using a mortar and pestle, digested with nitric and perchloric acid, and then
    analysed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-OES, model Optima
    7300 DV, Perkin Elmer, MA, USA). The P-resorption efficiency was calculated as
    the difference between mature and senesced leaf [P] divided by mature leaf [P].
    Phosphorus-resorption proficiency, or the amount of P present in the senesced
    leaves, was also determined. All [P] values in this study are expressed on a leaf
    dry mass basis.
