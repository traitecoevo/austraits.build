  description: Study to compare the ecophysiological traits of common trees and shrubs
    of semi-evergreen vine thicket (dry rainforest) on two copntrasting soils during
    the Millenial Drought and subsequent breaking of the drought.
  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: Experimental design ^p   Phytogeographical surveys of the dry
    rainforests of the western slopes of New South Wales (NSW) identified several
    sites where patches of a type of dry rainforest, semi-evergreen vine thicket (SEVT),
    occur on sandy soils (derived from both sandstone and basalt parent material)
    (Curran et al. 2008). However, the majority of SEVT patches in NSW occur on basalt-derived
    loams and clays (Benson et al. 1996; Curran 2006). Sandy soils and loam soils
    usually have distinctly different water storage characteristics, with sandy soils
    generally containing much less plant-available water (Kramer and Boyer 1995).
    Hence, it was possible to compare the traits of dry rainforest species on two
    soil types with contrasting water storage characteristics. The severe and extensive
    drought that affected much of NSW in 2002 and early 2003 (Bureau of Meteorology
    2003) provided the opportunity to critically examine predictions of the edaphic
    compensation hypothesis. ^p  Two sites were established in SEVT on loamy sand
    soil and two sites on silty loam soils. Four woody species from SEVT on both soil
    types were selected for the study. These species represented three different combinations
    of growth form and leaf phenology, Elaeodendron australe (Vent.) Kuntze var. integrifolia
    (Benth.) Jessop (evergreen tree); Ehretia membranifolia R.Br. (drought deciduous
    tree); Alstonia constricta F.Muell. (evergreen tree); and Carissa ovata R.Br.
    (evergreen shrub). Westoby (2002) advocated that the reasons for choosing species
    should be made explicit. These species were selected because they occur in sufficient
    numbers on both soil types, comprise dominant taxa of the tree and shrub layers
    of this community, and because they represent different functional types. ^p  Sampling
    was undertaken across three climatic regimes that reflect a combination of season
    and levels of rainfall compared with long-term averages, summer drought, winter
    non-drought, and summer non-drought. Each climatic regime was defined using meteorological
    definitions and rainfall data, thus, summer drought, summer period preceded by
    an eight month period of below average rainfall; winter non-drought, winter period
    after three months of above average rainfall, subsequent to the aforementioned
    summer drought; and summer non-drought, summer period typified by average to above-average
    rainfall for the preceding 10 months (Bureau of Meteorology 2004). Sampling was
    undertaken during the summer non-drought period of 2003-2004 to minimise the confounding
    effect of season. This was to attempt accounting for other environmental stresses
    associated with summer weather (e.g. high temperatures) that can have an effect
    on plant function, and permitted a more thorough examination of the effects of
    water deficits on plant water status. On several occasions (December 2002, January
    2003 and March 2003) it was not possible to complete measurements at all four
    sites; instead three sites were sampled. This was due to either heavy rainfall
    immediately prior or during the proposed sampling period and one case of equipment
    failure. This has resulted in an unbalanced design, which has been accounted for
    during subsequent analyses.

  entity_type: individual
  value_type: raw
  basis_of_value: measurement

  methods: Water stress was determined from xylem water potentials measured on excised
    twigs collected predawn (yPD) using a Scholander pressure chamber (Soil Moisture
    Equipment Corp. Santa Barbara, CA, USA) and collected according to the protocol
    of Borchert (1994). One sample (twig) from each individual was measured. This
    was based on a pilot study that found little variation in water potential between
    different samples taken from the same individual. Where possible twigs were cut
    only once, although in some instances (e.g. when twigs had to be sampled from
    the canopy using a pole pruner, or when the cut was not clean) a second cut was
    made with a razor blade.Apilot study demonstrated that there was no significant
    difference in water potential (F1,12 = 0.001, P = 0.97) for twigs cut once or
    twice. Each excised twig was immediately sealed in a zip-lock plastic bag and
    placed in a cool, shaded location and were then transported back to the field
    station for measurement.

  entity_type: individual
  value_type: mean
  basis_of_value: measurement

  methods: Stomatal conductance was measured using a Delta-T Porometer type AP4 (Delta-T
    Devices LTD Cambridge, UK). Stomatal conductance of the abaxial and adaxial leaf
    surfaces was measured on each of two or three leaves per individual and was summed
    to give total gs for each leaf, and a mean calculated for each individual plant.
    Where possible, measurements were made on leaves that were exposed to full sun.
    Measurements were undertaken from (1130-1530 h) and were stratified across species
    to minimise any effects of time of day. Stomatal conductance was measured during
    January, March and August 2003.

    converting the submitted units, leaf diffusive conductance cm/s, to the standard
    units for gs, mmol H2O/m2/s. To do this, AusTraits first tested the simplified
    version of the "conversion equation" presented many places (see below), assuming
    a temperature of 25C and sea level elevation; then the conversion factor is 40.3
    (*10 because of cm to mm unit conversions). If one plugs in the air pressure at
    400 meters elevation you get a conversion factor of 38.97 - which was ultimately
    used. For the base equation the reference is "Elevated Carbon Dioxide Impacts
    on Soil and Plant Water Relations" by M.B. Kirkham on page 149 and "Plants and
    Microclimate" by H.G. Jones (1992), page 55 and Appendix 3, but to plug in shifts
    in air pressure and temperature use the more complicated version of the equation

  replicates: 2-3
  methods: Measurements of specific leaf area (SLA) were carried out according to
    the protocols outlined by Westoby (1998) and Cornelissen et al. (2003). In December
    2002 and January 2003, fully expanded leaves were collected before dawn and refrigerated
    in Peak Fresh (Parkside, SA, Australia) polyethylene bags to keep them fresh until
    measurement. Projected leaf area was measured using a Delta-T Area Meter type
    AM/82 (Delta-T Devices LTD, Cambridge, UK). Two to three leaves were measured
    per individual and the average calculated.

  methods: Leaf angle to the horizontal was estimated for randomly chosen leaves using
    a protractor and a plum level (fishing line and sinker). Measurements were made
    of at least three (usually 6-9) leaves per individual and the means for each individual
    were used in all analyses.
