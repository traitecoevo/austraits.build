  collection_type: field
  sample_age_class: adult
  sampling_strategy: 'Plants were sampled over a 3 day period In late January 2007.
    Plants were opportunistically sampled as populations were encountered while traversing
    the landscape. The majority of habitats in the area were sampled: snowpatches,
    grasslands, bogs and fens, open and closed heaths and woodlands, crags. Individuals
    were sampled as healthy mature individuals  separated by at least 1m, but often
    close by. The aim was to sample 5 individuals. And at least two leaves per individual.
    Leaves were young, fully expanded and in sun.'

  notes: Leaf area and leaf mass were in the original spreadsheet we were given by
    Peter Vesk. They've been intentionally removed from the current version, because
    Peter Vesk is uncertain how many leaves were scanned for the recorded leaf areas.
    (The data were collected to calculate SLA, not explicitly for leaf area.)

  trait_name: specific_leaf_area
  value_type: site_mean
  replicates: most often 2; but 1 to several
  methods: Method broadly followed Perez-Hardindeguy et al 2013 Aust J Bot handbook.
    Leaves were sampled in field kept cool in plastic bags, allowed to moisten overnight
    in fridge, before being blotted dry and scanned using LiCoR leaf Area meter. Leaves
    were dried for 3 days at 65 degrees C before weighing. For resitonaceae and Juncaceae,
    the sampled organs included culm/photosynthetic stems
