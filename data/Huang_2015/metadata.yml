  description: An investigation of the main and interactive effects of elevated [CO2]
    (CE) and elevated temperature (TE) on growth and physiology of Coastal (warmer,
    less variable temperature environment) and Upland (cooler, more variable temperature
    environment) genotypes of an Australian woody species Telopea speciosissima.
  basis_of_record: lab
  life_stage: seedling
  sampling_strategy: 'Two natural genotypes of T. speciosissima were included in this
    study: one originating from Patonga (33.53 deg S, 151.28 deg E, 180 m altitude,
    the coastal region) and the other from Newnes Forest (33.39 deg S, 150.21 deg
    E, 1150 m altitude, the upland region). The coastal region is characterized by
    more annual precipitation and higher average temperatures (but with lower temperature
    variation) when compared with the upland region (Table 1), according to climate
    records from a network of weather stations across Australia (i.e. SILO Climate
    Data) (Jeffrey et al., 2001). As plant populations in these two regions have at
    least 90% gene identity specific to its corresponding gene pool (Rossetto et al.,
    2011), we defined them in this study as the Coastal genotype and the Upland genotype,
    respectively. A total of 200 seeds were collected from 24 mother plants (12 for
    each genotype) and planted in forestry tubes filled with a homogenous peat and
    sand mixture (1:2). Replicates of 25 seeds for each genotype were placed in one
    of four adjacent, naturally lit (direct sunlight attenuated by 10-15% due to the
    structure), [CO2]- and temperature-controlled glasshouse compartments (3.0 m x
    5.0 m x 3.5 m, width x length x height each), located at the University of Western
    Sydney, Richmond, NSW, Australia. Details of glasshouse design are described in
    Ghannoum et al. (2010a). Three months following seed germination (summer; January
    2012), ten seedlings from each genotype (within each glasshouse compartment) were
    randomly selected and transplanted into PVC pots (15 cm diameter x 40 cm length)
    that contained about 10 kg of dry loamy sand soil (86.5% sand and 9.5% clay).
    A factorial [CO2] and temperature design was applied to the four glasshouse compartments,
    with two [CO2] (ambient (CA) and elevated (CE)) and two temperature (ambient (TA)
    and elevated (TE)) treatments. TA was set at 26/16 deg C for day/night, while
    TE was set to maintain a 4 deg C increase in temperature above ambient (i.e. 30/20
    deg C for day/night). TA of 26/16 deg C was chosen because it approximates the
    mean of daily average temperatures in summer between the coastal and upland regions
    selected in this study. Based on the 40-year historical climate data, summer daily
    average temperatures were about 26.9/18.1 deg C and 24.9/12.6 deg C in the coastal
    and upland regions, respectively, averaging at 25.9/15.4 deg C (Table 1). Furthermore,
    over the 24-h period, temperature in each compartment was changed five times to
    simulate a natural diel temperature cycle in the field.'

    and GHS30_IntVarClim_Waratah-PxTxCxW_Harvest_2011_L1.csv, that were combined with
    custom R code. Photosynthetic rates at maximum CO2 concentrations were extracted
    from the ACi curve file for Amax values and maximum photosynthetic rates were
    extracted from the AQ curve file for Asat values.
  notes: Omitted pot 68, becuse in the spreadsheet with ACi curves, pot 68 is marked
    as being from population 'BWK219T2', while in the spreadsheet with AQ curve data,
    pot 68 is marked as being from population 'BWK214T2'

  methods: Subsamples of oven-dried plant material were ground to a fine powder in
    a ball mill prior to determination of the concentration of total nonstructural
    carbohydrates (NSC, sum of total soluble sugars and starch). Total soluble sugars
    were determined by the anthrone method and total starch was measured using the
    Megazyme total starch kit (Megazyme International Ireland, Wicklow, Ireland).
    Details of the NSC assay can be found in Mitchell et al. (2013). To calculate
    the soluble sugar (Ss) and starch (St) concentrations (mg g  1), contents of the
    measured pool were standardized by dry weight of the sample. Whole-plant Ss, St
    and NSC were calculated by summing the weighted concentrations (concentration
    multiplied by the proportion of organ dry mass to total dry mass) of different
    plant organs (leaf, stem, tuber and root). All carbohydrate measurements were
    conducted on five replicate seedlings per genotype and treatment.

    in 11 steps (0, 50, 100, 150, 200, 300, 400, 640, 900, 1300 and 1800 ppm). Five

    was applied to estimate Vcmax (maximum rate of photosynthetic carboxylation) and
    Jmax (maximum rate of photosynthetic electron transport) at measuring temperatures
    without constraining mesophyll conductance. Both Vcmax and Jmax were then corrected
    to a common temperature of 25C for comparisons between treatments

    assimilation rates to intercellular [CO2] (A/Ci curves) were measured at PPFD
    of 1200 umol m-2 s-1, midday growth temperature (26 or 30C), relative humidity
    of 55-65% and leaf-to-air VPD between 1.0 and 2.0 kPa, by raising cuvette [CO2]
    in 11 steps (0, 50, 100, 150, 200, 300, 400, 640, 900, 1300 and 1800 ppm). Five
    replicate seedlings were measured per genotype and treatment. The A/Ci curve fitting
    utility (version 0.4, updated in July 2007) developed by Sharkey et al (2007)
    was applied to estimate Vcmax (maximum rate of photosynthetic carboxylation) and
    Jmax (maximum rate of photosynthetic electron transport) at measuring temperatures
    without constraining mesophyll conductance. Both Vcmax and Jmax were then corrected
    to a common temperature of 25C for comparisons between treatments

    Leaf gas exchange measurements were conducted on attached, recently fully expanded
