Telopea speciosissima
Population x Temperature x CO2

Parameters calculated from CO2 response curves

Method:
Photosynthetic assimilation rates to intercellular [CO2] (A/Ci curves) were measured at PPFD of 1200 umol m-2 s-1, midday growth temperature (26 or 30C), relative humidity of 55-65% and leaf-to-air VPD between 1.0 and 2.0 kPa, by raising cuvette [CO2] in 11 steps (0, 50, 100, 150, 200, 300, 400, 640, 900, 1300 and 1800 ppm)
Five replicate seedlings were measured per genotype and treatment
The A/Ci curve fitting utility (version 0.4, updated in July 2007) developed by Sharkey et al (2007) was applied to estimate Vcmax (maximum rate of photosynthetic carboxylation) and Jmax (maximum rate of photosynthetic electron transport) at measuring temperatures without constraining mesophyll conductance
Both Vcmax and Jmax were then corrected to a common temperature of 25C for comparisons between treatments
