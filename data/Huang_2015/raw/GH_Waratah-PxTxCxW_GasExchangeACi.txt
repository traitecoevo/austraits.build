Telopea speciosissima
Population x Temperature x CO2

Licor data of CO2 response curves

Method:
Photosynthetic assimilation rates to intercellular [CO2] (A/Ci curves) were measured at PPFD of 1200 umol m-2 s-1, midday growth temperature (26 or 30C), relative humidity of 55-65% and leaf-to-air VPD between 1.0 and 2.0 kPa, by raising cuvette [CO2] in 11 steps (0, 50, 100, 150, 200, 300, 400, 640, 900, 1300 and 1800 ppm)
Five replicate seedlings were measured per genotype and treatment

Variables
Species:
Population: genotypes, Coastal and Upland
Temp: air temperature treatment
CO2: CO2 treatment
Genotype:
Potnum: pot number
The rest of the variables are from a standard LI-6400 file
