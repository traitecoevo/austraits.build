Telopea speciosissima
Population x Temperature x CO2

Licor data of light response curves

Method:
Photosynthetic assimilation rates to light (A/Q curves) were measured at growth CO2 (400 or 640 ppm), midday growth temperature (26 or 30C), relative humidity of 55-65% and leaf-to-air VPD between 1.0 and 2.0 kPa, by lowering cuvette PAR in 12 steps (1800, 1400, 1000, 900, 700, 500, 300, 200, 100, 60, 30, 0 umol m-2 s-1)
Five replicate seedlings were measured per genotype and treatment

Variables
Species:
Population: genotypes, Coastal and Upland
Temp: air temperature treatment
CO2: CO2 treatment
Potnum: pot number
The rest of the variables are from a standard LI-6400 file
