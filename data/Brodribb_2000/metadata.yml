  description: A strong relationship between hydraulic supply of water to leaves and
    maximum photosynthetic capacity was found in a group of seven conifers and 16
    angiosperm species, including two vessel-less taxa, from similar rainforest communities
    in New Caledonia and Tasmania (Australia).
  basis_of_record: Context
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: Nine evergreen woody tree and shrub species were selected including
    three conifers and six angiosperms. In order to maximize the range of KL and ØPSII,
    we also included two fast-growing pioneer species known to have high KL (Brodribb
    & Hill, 2000). These were Eucalyptus regnans F. Muell. and Toona australis (F.
    Muell.) Harms. Five plants of each of these two species were grown in a glasshouse
    under optimal conditions of light, temperature and nutrition. Sun-exposed branches
    were collected from four individual trees of each species and measured in the
    field. Lateral branches were always used as these are more conservative in their
    KL than leaders (Zimmermann 1983). Segments cut from these laterals were chosen
    such that there were no major branches along their length.

  methods: Sapwood-area specific conductivity (Ksp) was determined by dividing stem
    hydraulic conductivity (KH) by the sapwood cross-section area. Sapwood cross-section
    was measured with a micrometer along the major and minor axes of the distal stem
    end and the surface area contributed by the pith was subtracted (Sperry et al.
    1988). Stem hydraulic conductivity (KH) was defined as the mass flow rate of water
    through an excised stem segment per unit pressure gradient (kg s-1 MPa-1 m). We
    used a low-pressure steady-state flow meter (SSFM) method together with the pressure
    at the stem fitting, to calculate KH; (Zwieniecki et al. 2000; Feild & Holbrook,
    in press). Briefly, an elevated reservoir was used to drive water through a 1.25
    m long piece of capillary tubing (PEEK, Upchurch Scientific, WA, USA) and the
    stem segment, arranged in series. The reservoir water was filtered through a 0.1
    mm filter before reaching the stem. Two pressure transducers (PX236, Omega Engineering
    Inc., Stamford, CT, USA) were used to measure the pressure at each end of the
    capillary tube, allowing both the pressure drop across Hydraulic and photosynthetic
    co-ordination 1383 the capillary tube and the delivery pressure to the stem segment
    to be determined. The conductance of each tube was determined in the laboratory
    by comparing the pressure drop across the tube at a known temperature to the outflow
    rate measured by an analytic balance (± 0.01 mg). Four delivery pressures (0.0008,
    0.0015, 0.0025, 0.0035 and 0.050 MPa) were used and a linear calibration equation
    determined for each capillary tube (Zwieniecki et al. 2000). Capillary tubes were
    calibrated before travel to the field and then immediately upon return to check
    for drift. After correcting for temperature, a 2% change was observed in the calibration
    value over a 2 month period. Stems were measured under delivery pressures ranging
    from 0.003 to 0.01 MPa. Data were recorded when steady-state pressure readings
    were achieved (typically 10 min) after connection to flowmeter apparatus. During
    all measurements, stem temperature was measured with a copper-constantan thermocouple
    (30 American wire gauge, Omega Engineering) so that the effect of temperature
    on viscosity of water flux could be removed by normalizing all measurements to
    20 °C (Sperry et al. 1988). Branches were sampled at times when losses of hydraulic
    conductivity due to embolisms were probably at a minimum [i.e. early morning (0800
    to 0930 h) on wet, cloudy days]. Sampled branches were cut in the field, triple
    bagged in plastic and transported immediately to a laboratory in a tent. Both
    ends of the stem segment were shaved with a fresh razor blade before attachment
    to the SSFM.

  trait_name: leaf_fluorescence_quantum_yield
  entity_type: population
  value_type: mean
  basis_of_value: measurement
  replicates: 5
  methods: The quantum yield of PSII electron transport was determined in the light
    using a PAM-2000 portable fluorometer (Waltz, Effeltrich, Germany) operated in
    the field according to Bilger et al. (1996). Preliminary measurements made throughout
    the day indicated that ØPSII determined at a PPFD of 1000 mmol m-2 s-1 peaked
    at around midday, and there was no evidence of midday depression of ØPSII (T.
    J. Brodribb, unpublished results). Therefore all measurements were made within
    60 min of midday on a single cloudless day at both Mt Dzumac and Mt Field. Five
    measurements of ØPSII were made on each of five representatives of each species.
    We selected fully expanded leaves from exposed, undamaged branches and ØPSII was
    determined by measuring the increase in chlorophyll fluorescence during the application
    of a single saturating flash of light (Genty et al. 1989) to leaves illuminated
    by full sun. Saturation pulses were applied for 0.8 s at an intensity of 3500
    mmol m-2 s-1. In full sun, the PPFD on Mt. Field it was 1900 mmol m-2 s-1. Mean
    leaf temperatures in Tasmania ranged between 23.2°C and 20.1°C respectively.
