traits:
- var_in: Seed mass (mg)
  unit_in: g
  trait_name: seed_dry_mass
  entity_type: population
  value_type: mean
  basis_of_value: measurement
  replicates: unknown
  methods: note, the seed masses were far too low for the units to be mg; almost all
    species align well with other AusTraits values for the same species if the input
    units are 'g'. One species, Malva preissiana, now has a seed mass approximately
    10x too high, versus previously 100x too low.
