taxonomic_updates:
- find: Atriplex nummaularia
  replace: Atriplex nummularia
  reason: Change spelling to align with APC or ALA species lists (Sam Andrew, 2018-02-07)
- find: Austrostipa nodosa
  replace: Stipa nodosa
  reason: Synonym reported by TaxonStand (2018-02-08)
questions:
  contributors: The seed masses in this study are very low - please confirm that they are accurate. I'm thinking maybe the units should be 'g' not 'mg'
  question2: Do you have any location information for these data? Even the name of the national park/reserve where there were collected would be excellent. I can then link the lat/long for the park's headquarters to give an approximate location.
