Seeds transverse to oblique, oblong, 5-6 mm long, 2.5-3 mm wide; aril small, terminal, oblique, pileate, white. A variable species in need of critical study, see B.R. Maslin & J.E. Reid, Nuytsia 22(4): 181-190 (2012), for discussion. Typical A. ayersiana has rather large phyllodes (mostly 50-80 x 7-12 mm), the new shoots are not resinous (except for margin of young phyllodes) and are densely sericeous by normally pale yellow hairs that obscure the underlying nervation, and the pods are 10-14 (-17) mm wide. Plants with short phyllodes (normally 35-50 mm long) and often narrow pods (6-10 mm wide) are most common in Western Australia from Wiluna east to the Gibson Desert (e.g. B.R. Maslin 5658, PERTH). A morphologically variable, narrow-phyllode variant (4-6 mm wide) is scattered throughout the range of the species; some of these plants have falcate phyllodes and/or new shoots that are moderately resinous, dark reddish brown and often striate with appressed white hairs between the rather obvious nerves (e.g. D.E. Albrecht 11399, NT, PERTH). A member of the 'A. aneura group' (Mulga) most closely related to A. aneura which has narrower phyllodes that lack a discrete, resinous marginal nerve. These two species putatively hybridise in Western Australia in the Pilbara region, Gibson Desert and Central Ranges (east of Warburton) where they can form complex populations containing individuals that appear to vary continuously between the presumed parents; see B.R. Maslin & J.E. Reid (2012) for discussion. Representative specimen: Gibson Desert, W.A., 67 km SSE of Clutterbuck Hills, W.A., S.D. Hopper 2906B (PERTH). Putative hybrids between A. ayersiana and A. incurvaneura also occur in the Pilbara (e.g. M.E. Trudgen 17615) and in a few other places where the putative parents co-occur. Short phyllode forms of A. ayersiana can resemble long phyllode forms of A. mulganeura which are most readily distinguished by the thick, opaque (not translucent) resin on their branchlet ribs; these two species putatively hybridise in the Pilbara region. Specimens of the narrow-phyllode variant with falcate phyllodes are sometimes difficult to distinguish from the narrow-phyllode variant of A. caesaneura (see A. caesaneura for discussion). Usually grows in sandy soils, often in swales of dunes. Acacia ayersiana is generally killed by fire but can regenerate from the base of the trunk. Indigenous peoples of the Pilbara used the timber from this species to make digging sticks, clubs and other tools. Flowers recorded February, April-June."

In the Pilbara region of Western Australia A. bivenosa hybridises with A. ampliceps and A. sclerosperma subsp. sclerosperma. As discussed by A.R. Chapman & B.R. Maslin, Nuytsia 8(2): 249-283 (1992), A. bivenosa is a variable species, especially with respect to growth form and phyllode morphology. The phyllodes are often distinctly 2-veined, but on plants with very narrow phyllodes and on many plants from Northern Territory and Queensland, the second vein can be reduced and obscure or even absent. In northwestern Western Australia a number of variants are recognised: plants from the Hamersley Range and on islands of the Dampier Archipelago have generally narrower than normal (mostly 5-12 mm wide with l: w ratio = 3-8), narrowly elliptic to oblanceolate phyllodes (e.g. between Tom Price and the Wittenoom-Nanutarra road, B.R. Maslin 4667, PERTH); plants from Airlie Island and Thevenard Island have atypically long (normally 4-9 cm), 1- or 2-veined phyllodes (e.g. V. Long 165, PERTH); at Dampier and in the Tom Price-Newman area a variant with a distinctive weeping habit is common (e.g. Burrup Peninsula, N of Dampier, B.R. Maslin 4740, BRI, PERTH). The sympatric occurrence of plants with green phyllodes and those with glaucous phyllodes is not unusual and has no taxonomic significance. Occasional plants from Western Australia, Northern Territory and Queensland have puberulous branchlets and raceme axes. G. Bentham's concept of A. bivenosa included A. xanthina (Drummond 1: 283, Preiss 928) and A. didyma (Dirk Hartog Island, [A.] Cunningham [330]), according to A.R. Chapman & B.R. Maslin, Nuytsia 8(2): 249-283 (1992). However, A. bivenosa is readily distinguished from these two more southerly distributed species by the more elongate phyllodes of A. xanthina and wider pods of A. didyma. Acacia bivenosa is often sympatric with A. startii. It is closely related to and sometimes difficult to distinguish from A. ligulata (possibly due to hybridisation), particularly in south-central Northern Territory where they are partially sympatric. Grows in a variety of soils, including coastal sand, and on rocky hillsides and gullies, in shrubland, open shrubland and open woodland, often associated with spinifex. In the Pilbara Acacia bivenosa is used extensively in land rehabilitation. It is generally killed by fire and regenerates from seed although under very cool burn conditions large plants may regenerate from root stock close to the base of the parent plant.

In the Pilbara region of Western Australia A. bivenosa hybridises with A. ampliceps and A. sclerosperma subsp. sclerosperma. As discussed by A.R. Chapman & B.R. Maslin, Nuytsia 8(2): 249-283 (1992), A. bivenosa is a variable species, especially with respect to growth form and phyllode morphology. The phyllodes are often distinctly 2-veined, but on plants with very narrow phyllodes and on many plants from Northern Territory and Queensland, the second vein can be reduced and obscure or even absent. In northwestern Western Australia a number of variants are recognised: plants from the Hamersley Range and on islands of the Dampier Archipelago have generally narrower than normal (mostly 5-12 mm wide with l: w ratio = 3-8), narrowly elliptic to oblanceolate phyllodes (e.g. between Tom Price and the Wittenoom-Nanutarra road, B.R. Maslin 4667, PERTH); plants from Airlie Island and Thevenard Island have atypically long (normally 4-9 cm), 1- or 2-veined phyllodes (e.g. V. Long 165, PERTH); at Dampier and in the Tom Price-Newman area a variant with a distinctive weeping habit is common (e.g. Burrup Peninsula, N of Dampier, B.R. Maslin 4740, BRI, PERTH). The sympatric occurrence of plants with green phyllodes and those with glaucous phyllodes is not unusual and has no taxonomic significance. Occasional plants from Western Australia, Northern Territory and Queensland have puberulous branchlets and raceme axes. G. Bentham's concept of A. bivenosa included A. xanthina (Drummond 1: 283, Preiss 928) and A. didyma (Dirk Hartog Island, [A.] Cunningham [330]), according to A.R. Chapman & B.R. Maslin, Nuytsia 8(2): 249-283 (1992). However, A. bivenosa is readily distinguished from these two more southerly distributed species by the more elongate phyllodes of A. xanthina and wider pods of A. didyma. Acacia bivenosa is often sympatric with A. startii. It is closely related to and sometimes difficult to distinguish from A. ligulata (possibly due to hybridisation), particularly in south-central Northern Territory where they are partially sympatric. Grows in a variety of soils, including coastal sand, and on rocky hillsides and gullies, in shrubland, open shrubland and open woodland, often associated with spinifex. In the Pilbara Acacia bivenosa is used extensively in land rehabilitation. It is generally killed by fire and regenerates from seed although under very cool burn conditions large plants may regenerate from root stock close to the base of the parent plant.

Population genetic studies using isozyme techniques show that populations of this species are clonal, reproducing almost exclusively by root suckering, however all but two populations are genetically different. The species is seemingly a shy seeder as all pods observed to date have been without seed. See M. Bartolome et al., Australian Systematic Botany 15: 465-475 (2002), for further discussion. The gland-tipped hairs on the phyllodes are distinctive and are absent from its closest relative, A. glandulicarpa which occurs further west and differs also in having non-pendulous branchlets, glabrous peduncles and generally broader pods. Comprehensive information concerning this species, including a morphometric analysis involving some presumed close relatives, is provided in M. Bartolome et al., Australian Systematic Botany 15: 465-475 (2002). Grows in subalpine, high-elevated environments in open forest and woodland. Information on habitat, population dynamics, fire ecology, conservation, etc. is provided by M. Bartolome et al., Australian Systematic Botany 15: 465-475 (2002). Flowers recorded October."

Acacia falciformis is usually distinguished from related species with large, falcately recurved phyllodes and broad pods, by its yellow appressed-puberulous raceme axes and peduncles (hairs occasionally white or absent; A. mabellae has similar indumentum but with  spreading hairs), and phyllodes with their adaxial margin shallowly indented at the gland which is situated 5-30 mm above the pulvinus and connected to the midrib by a fine oblique nerve. The variant from Glasshouse Mountains, Queensland, referred to by L. Pedley, Austrobaileya 1: 267 (1980), is probably within the normal range of variation for the species. However, many specimens from further N in Queensland are unusual in having the gland located 0-5 mm above the pulvinus and seemingly lacking the oblique nerve to the midrib. These can be confused with A. falcata which is distinguished by its peduncles 3-4 mm long, heads 15-20-flowered, sepals  free, pods 5-8 mm wide and funicles completely encircling the seeds. Patterns of variation within these Queensland populations require further study. Past confusion between A. falciformis and A. penninervis is discussed by J.H. Maiden, Forest Flora of New South Wales 3: 69-77 (1907), and summarised by L. Pedley, Austrobaileya 1: 269 (1980). Acacia obliquinervia was also formerly confounded with A. falciformis. Phyllodes are sometimes  mottled pinkish purple upon drying and may resemble those of A. rubida, a species readily distinguished by its commonly persistent juvenile foliage, peduncles normally 2-4 mm long, heads light golden and 10-20-flowered, pods 5-8 mm wide and funicles completely encircling the seeds. Acacia falciformis appears to hybridise with A. bancroftiorum in the Leichhardt District, Queensland. N.T. Burbidge & M. Gray, Flora of the Australian Capital Territory 202 (1970), report A. falciformis in the Australian Capital Territory as forming thickets by root suckers following fire or disturbance. Grows in clay loam in sclerophyll forest or woodland."

Pods and seeds not seen (see below), recorded as narrow-linear in C.A. Gardner 1369. At the time of compiling the Flora of Australia (Maslin 2001) Acacia lentiginea was known only from the type and the Cunningham specimen cited above. This led Maslin (2001: 218) to state ""it is curious that A. lentiginea is so poorly known, especially given the considerable collecting that has occurred in the Prince Regent River area in recent years"" and ""it is therefore assumed that the species is rare and has very specific habitat requirements"". Since then, there have been several new collections and observations, and these confirm the rarity of the species. More recent collections of A. lentiginea in the West Kimberley indicate A. lentiginea grows in rare habitats in the region (see habitat notes above) which would contribute to the plant being rarely collected (R.L. Barrett, pers. comm., October 2018). If the pods which are described in the protologue of Acacia lentiginea in fact belong to this species then they are probably very similar to those of A. tenuispica. Acacia tenuispica differs most obviously from A. lentiginea in its ribbed, angled branchlets and its shorter, straight phyllodes. In Gardner's field book the flowers of A. lentiginea are described as cream-coloured, and in M.D. Bennett 1833 recorded as pale yellow; in A. tenuispica the spikes are golden. Acacia lentigenea is similar to A. plectocarpa subsp. plectocarpa which is recognised by its hairy ovary and calyx, and transversely wrinkled pulvinus 2-3 mm long (smooth and c. 1 mm long in A. lentiginea). Acacia lentiginea is perhaps related to A. kimberleyensis. Recorded growing between sandstone boulders near a creek, and on a sandstone pavement. In the West Kimberley, Acacia lentiginea appears to be restricted to the higher rainfall zone, and grows around sandstone pavements in fire-protected sites (R.L. Barrett, pers. comm., October 2018).

Pods narrowly oblong, slightly indented, flat except raised over seeds, 1.8-10 cm long, (7-) 10-15 mm wide, coriaceous, brown, transversely reticulate, with indumentum as on branchlets, viscid (especially when young) with the resin sweetly aromatic; margins thickened and yellow. Seeds transverse or slightly oblique, broadly oblong to oblong-elliptic, 4-6.2 mm long, dark brown; areole small, closed, surrounding by a broad pale halo. Acacia monticola has a striate corolla, which is an uncommon state. On Dampier Peninsula N of Broome, Western Australia, wind-pruned plants in coastal areas are sometimes prostrate but further inland they attain arborescent stature 6-8 m tall. Acacia monticola is one of the transitional species between the Plurinerves and Juliflorae. It has a 'Minni Ritchi' bark as in A. chisholmii, A. lysiphloia and A. trachycarpa with each of which it hybridises. Examples of A. monticola x A. chisholmii hybrids: Mount Isa, Qld, C.H. Gittins 748 (NSW); Lake Moondarra, Qld, R.G. Coveny 476 (NSW). Example of A. monticola x A. lysiphloia hybrid: 3.2 km N of Powell Creek, N.T., J.R. Maconochie 1738 (DNA, NSW). For A. monticola x trachycarpa hybrids see A. monticola x trachycarpa. Acacia monticola also hybridises with the non 'Minni Ritchi' species A. tumida in Western Australia (see A. monticola x tumida var. pilbarensis and A. tumida var. tumida) and with A. phlebocarpa in the Burke District, Queenslandd (e.g. R. Booth 5543 & D.T. Kelman, BRI). Grows mainly on ironstone or sandstone/quartzite in stony skeletal soils, often on rocky ridges or steep slopes, in red sand or sandy loam, in eucalypt woodland, open Acacia shrubland or spinifex (Triodia) communities. Acacia monticola is relatively fast-growing; it generally reproduces from seed, does not coppice but has the capacity to resprout adventitiously after mild fires. In some places in the Pilbara it shows prolific seedling regeneration following fire (B.R. Maslin et al., Wattles of the Pilbara 2010). Details of ecology, utilisation, etc. of A. monticola are given in J.W. Turnbull (ed.), Multipurpose Australian Trees and Shrubs 168-169 (1986). Flowers April-August. See B.R. Maslin et al., Wattles of the Pilbara (2010)."

Acacia sphaerostachya is probably a hybrid between A. ancistrocarpa and A. stellaticeps . Acacia stellaticeps is also reputed to hybridise with A. arida and A. hilliana. Grows in red, sometimes clayey sand over quartzite, limestone, laterite or ironstone, on hills or sandplains, often on flats between parallel sand dunes, in open savannah, scrub heath, grassland or shrubland, often with spinifex. Can coppice from the base following fire or regenerate profusely from seed, fide B.R. Maslin et al., Wattles of the Pilbara (2010). Flowers February-September. Flowering probably dependent upon the timing and intensity of rainfall events, fide B.R. Maslin et al., Wattles of the Pilbara (2010). ""Indigenous peoples prepared a topical wash from A. stellaticeps to help stop itching, skin sores and irritations by boiling the phyllodes in water. This wash also helps alleviate the symptom of a cold."""

Kircher (1986) reported detailed studies of the flowers, inflorescence structure and seedlings in the New Zealand Apodasmia similis (as Leptocarpus similis E.Edgar). Apodasmia shows a very homogeneous and unusual flavonoid profile (Williams et al. 1998). Reduced leaves on horizontal rhizomes are referred to as scales; reduced leaves on the culm as sheaths; cataphylls are erect leaves at the base of the culms; spathes are the primary bracts subtending the inflorescence or inflorescence branches. Pillar cells are elongate, palisade-like cells of the parenchyma sheath, usually with moderately thickened walls, radiating from the sclerenchyma sheath to the epidermis, dividing the chlorenchyma into longitudinal bands. Moist habitats, often somewhat saline. Wind-pollinated; regenerating after fire by resprouting."

Baloskion tetraphyllum subsp. meiostachyum has smooth seeds similar to other Baloskion species. The observation on B. tetraphyllum subsp. tetraphyllum was on a single specimen, although on several seeds, and this unexpected difference should be followed up with observations throughout the range of the species. Permanently moist peaty sand, near streams and the edges of lagoons, swampy places, riverbanks, in oligotrophic soils. Regenerates by seed after fire; wind pollinated. Flowers mid-summer."

sometimes the tips are replaced by thickened,  structures (osmophores) containing the glands. these glandular tails and clubs are the site of pseudopheromone production that is important for pollination. the labellum of each caladenia species is markedly different to all the other floral segments in shape and is often also of a contrasting colour, especially the apical lobe which in many species is bright red to maroon. the labellum is hinged by a short claw to the base of the column, usually stiffly hinged but sometimes delicately balanced. labellum shape ranges from unlobed to distinctly 3-lobed, with the lateral lobes often broad and curved upwards to flank the column; and usually arches longitudinally in a graceful curve, often with the apex recurved or coiled inwards. labellum margins range from entire to adorned with a fringe of variously shaped marginal teeth, these sometimes fused into a thickened band. the centre of the labellum is adorned with rows of stalked or sessile, colourful calli in various shapes, decreasing in size towards the labellum apex. in some groups of caladenia, the basal calli are a different size and colour to the rest. the column is narrowly to broadly winged and the anther carries four bilobed, flat pollinia without a viscidium. the pollen is usually yellow, occasionally white. most caladenia species occur as separate individuals, some form clonal colonies, and some grow in localised clonal tufts. the root system consists of a parent tuber and replacement tuber partially covered by a fibrous multilayered tunic which extends as a sheath to the soil surface and through which each annual shoot develops. tubers are replaced annually on short droppers, the new one often deeper in the soil than the previous one. each tuber adds a new layer of fibre to the inner side of the tunic. the sheath of old plants consists of several layers of fibre and is expanded at each point where a tuber has developed, these structures often forming an interlinked chain. at ground level the stem swells and forms a collar, which is the primary site of fungal infection.  species of caladenia occur in a wide range of forested, shrubby and heathy habitats from the coast to the inland plains, and from the lowlands to montane and subalpine areas. they mostly grow in soils with free drainage, but some species have adapted to seasonally moist, wet or peaty soils. flowering is generally enhanced by hot summer fires, especially when densely overgrown vegetation is burnt. species of caladenia are deciduous and die back to a dormant, fleshy tuber over summer. the tuber sprouts after soaking autumn/winter rains and develops a leaf which expands and matures before an inflorescence is produced. caladenia species use a range of strategies to achieve cross-pollination. most species are sexually deceptive; fooling their insect pollinators into thinking they are a desirable insect mate. several caladenia species use food deception to attract other types of insects by pretending to offer a food reward. a small number of caladenia species are self-pollinating. to achieve pollination by sexual deception, the orchid lures male thynnine wasps to the flower by producing a false sex hormone (kairomone or pseudopheromone) that mimics the sex scent released by a wingless female thynnine wasp when advertising for a mate. at close range, the shape, colour and tactile features of the flower persuade the male wasp to grapple with the labellum, either attempting to mate with it or fly away with the labellum for aerial mating. passive pivoting movements of the labellum during the grappling process bring the wasp into proximity with the pollen, depositing the pollinia on the wasp's thorax, or on the stigma when the wasp visits a second flower. recent research has shown that some wasp-pollinated spider orchids (e g arenaria, hastata, paludosa) produce small amounts of nectar on the labellum which probably acts both as a reward and an inducement for the wasp to continue visiting other flowers. detailed studies indicate that most sexually deceptive species of caladenia have a relationship with a single species of wasp (phillips et al. 2009b). however, pollinator sharing can occur between species of wasp-pollinated caladenia, indicating geographical variation in the composition of the wasp pheromone produced by the orchid (colin bower, pers. comm.). cryptic species have been shown to occur within caladenia concinna (bower 2001a) and tentaculata (phillips et al. 2009b). most species of caladenia that have colourful flowers use food deception to achieve pollination. very few species produce visible quantities of nectar on the labellum (nana is an exception). this system of deceit is common in the small-flowered species but also found in several of the larger-flowered spider orchids and wispy spider orchids. although very few studies have been undertaken, the pollinators are mostly small native bees of the families apidae (social bees), colletidae (plasterer bees) and halictidae (sweat bees); also flies in the families syrphidae (hover flies) and conopidae (thick-headed flies). nectar scarab beetles (cetoniinae) pollinate flava. introduced honey bees (apis mellifera) have been observed visiting flowers and removing pollinia. no apparent close or specific relationship between the pollinator and the orchid species has been noted. self-pollination is relatively rare in caladenia, which is perhaps surprising considering that several species extend into montane areas with climates that are not particularly congenial to insects. altogether, about 12 species of small-flowered caladenia are known to be self-pollinating, as well as graminifolia and cruscula, and two subspecies of the limestone spider orchid (bicalliata subsp bicalliata and subsp cleistogama). most species flower in late winter, spring and early summer. caladenia drummondii is an exception, flowering in winter while the leaf is still not fully expanded. ;",high,NA,summer,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,fire_enhanced_flowering,direct_from_flora,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Most above-ground parts of these terrestrial orchids are hairy.

Most species flower in late winter, spring and early summer. Caladenia drummondii is an exception, flowering in winter while the leaf is still not fully expanded."

A facultative stilting species which may appear rhizomatous as soil often aggregates at the plant base forming a raised mound around the roots. It does not form a distinct subterranean rhizome and all shoots arise from above the soil surface. There is very minor storage of starch in the stem and in central pith of stilt roots suggesting that this species would not have sufficient reserves to resprout following fire. While its fire response has not been observed, this species is almost certainly killed by fire. Flowers June-August."

Nut ellipsoid, 1-2 mm long, smooth, pale brown. Culm anatomy: chlorenchyma of 2-4 layers of short cells, interrupted by pillar cells and partial sclerenchyma ridges opposite the outer vascular bundles, central cavity present or absent. In the Busselton region there are some dwarf specimens, flowering with culms 7-16 cm tall. Reduced leaves on the culms are referred to as sheaths; cataphylls are erect leaves at the base of the culms. Pillar cells are elongate, palisade-like cells of the parenchyma sheath, usually with moderately thickened (lignified) walls, radiating from the sclerenchyma sheath to the epidermis, dividing the chlorenchyma into longitudinal bands. Cluster roots form clusters of closely spaced short lateral rootlets; they may form a mat just beneath the soil surface and are mostly found in plants of oligotrophic sites. Fan hairs are multicellular hairs, often peltate, that are mostly appressed to the culm, forming a scale-like covering or so closely appressed that the culm appears glabrous. Moist sites in heath or shrubland and in swamps, in sand, peaty sand or (less often) clay; sites seasonally wet. Wind-pollinated; killed by fire, regeneration is by seed.

(2015), pollination in the few species so far studied is exclusively by small flies of the families chloropidae (grass flies), milichiidae (jackal flies) and scatopsidae (scavenger flies). the flies land on the inflorescence and then move to the labellum and feed on the labellum nectar, delving deep into the flower until they reach the base of the labellum, eventually contacting the viscidium and removing the pollinarium on their thorax. pollen deposition occurs during a subsequent visit. garnet (1940) collected five species of flies on unspecified species of corunastylis; two of the flies were chloropids (caviceps flavipes and gaurax (as oscinosoma subpilosa). the author has collected unidentified species of clavipes on corunastylis despectans, morrisii, nigricans and rufa. alan logan collected a species of gaurax (chlopopidae) and stomosis (milichiidae) on corunastylis clivicola and colin bower collected clavipes flavipes on corunastylis rufa (both records in bower 2001). ants may also be occasional pollinators of these orchids. for photos of insects visiting the flowers of species of corunastylis see kuiter (2013, pp. 70-75; 2017, pp. 36-55). ;",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,fire_enhanced_flowering,direct_from_flora,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Plants growing singly or in loose groups.

It has been generally believed that the flowers of helmet orchids mimic small fungi and deceive female gnats into entering the flower to lay eggs. However, studies by Victorian observers suggested a different mechanism (Kuiter & Findlater-Smith 2017). They found that both male and female Mycetophilid gnats in the genera Mycetophila and Phthinia were attracted to the flowers, apparently by a scent, and fed on the surface of the labellum boss. These gnats are sexually dimorphic and apparently only the smaller sized gnats can bring about pollination. In the genus Mycetophila the males are smallest and can pollinate helmet orchids, whereas the reverse is true in species of Phthinia. Most insect activity was observed in the afternoon, and it is suggested that the gnats emerged from their pupae in the morning and flew direct to the flowers to feed. After feeding on the labellum boss, the gnat moved down the labellum tube to the column, possibly attracted by a stronger scent from this area. Tiny tubular openings (auricles) in the base of the labellum of most species (not present in Corybas) presumably aid the dispersal of the odour into the surrounding atmosphere. Only insects of a suitable size can negotiate this passage and once there it is suggested they feed on secretions from the enlarged ventral pad on the column. When sated the gnats turn around to climb back up the labellum tube and, in the process, pick up the pollinarium on their thorax. Intriguingly the gnats were found to be species specific for each species of helmet orchid studied, but unlike the syndrome of pseudocopulation, both sexes of insects are involved. Some small species of helmet orchid have self-pollinating flowers."

In wet habitats, it commonly grows on tops of small mounds and corrugations, and within tussocks of spiky rushes. The areas become filled with water after heavy rain and the orchid plants can be totally submerged for a period. In the subtropics this species grows in wetlands dominated by broad-leaved paperbark (Melaleuca quinquenervia). A disjunct montane population occurs at high altitude on Timbarra Plateau, northern N.S.W., growing with Baeckea omissa (Lachlan Copeland pers. comm.). Flowering is probably enhanced by summer fires, certainly plants are a lot easier to find in the season after a burn. Flowers July-early November."

they are useful indicators of environmental degradation, for example in some species being sensitive to pollution, or to receding water levels; removal of sediments; production of peat and peat soil; water flow stabilisation and flow control;

Spikelets or pseudospikelets either solitary or clustered, terete or compressed, 1- to many-flowered, terminal and/or lateral, spirally arranged or sometimes distichous (e.g. Blysmus, not in Australia); spikelets each subtended by a bract (sometimes called a spikelet bract), and often bearing a small modified bract called a prophyll at the base. Flowers bisexual or rarely unisexual and the species then monoecious or rarely dioecious (some Carex  and Cyperus species not occurring in Australia, some Scleria species), actinomorphic, inconspicuous, each usually solitary within a bract here called a glume, arranged along a rachilla (spikelet axis); rachilla persistent or caducous, straight or flexuose, sometimes winged; glumes arranged either distichously or spirally on the rachilla or the proximal glumes arranged spirally and the distal ones arranged distichously or vice versa, caducous or persistent, one or more of the lower or upper ones often empty. Perianth often absent or reduced to (1-) 3-6 (-30) hypogynous scales, bristles or hairs, very rarely subtepaloid or disc-like, persistent. Stamens (1-) 3 (-6 or seldom more), filaments usually free, sometimes long persistent and attached to base of nut (some Gahnia, some Machaerina); anthers basifixed, tetrasporangiate, dithecal, dehiscing by longitudinal lateral slits, anthers often with an apical appendage and sometimes also basal appendages; pollen grains borne in pseudomonads.

Embryo embedded in copious mealy endosperm. Numerous species of Cyperaceae are economically significant weeds. Cyperus rotundus (Nutgrass) has sometimes been referred to as the world's worst weed (Holm et al. 1977), infesting crops throughout the warmer regions of the world (Reznicek 1998). About 60 species have become naturalised in Australia, including 17 species of Carex. Carex divisa (Divided Sedge) was deliberately introduced in some areas for stabilisation of stream banks but soon became invasive into pasture, and in indigenous riparian vegetation. It often forms large dense swards at exclusion of other species, and is a serious environmental and agricultural weed. At least 26 species of Cyperus have also naturalised in Australia. Occupying diverse habitats, with a preference for open and aquatic habitats, but Australia, like South Africa, is also home to a large diversity of dryland species. Cyperaceae are of considerable ecological importance. Sedges are a conspicuous and often dominant component in the vegetation of many habitats, often aquatic, sometimes forming vast stands as in Cyperus papyrus in Africa and to a lesser extent some upland Carex sedgelands in southeastern Australia. Sedge communities play a number of roles in wetland ecosystems including: providing habitat for fauna; they are useful indicators of environmental degradation, for example in some species being sensitive to pollution, or to receding water levels; removal of sediments; production of peat and peat soil; water flow stabilisation and flow control; primary producers in the food chain; recycling of nutrients and removal of heavy metals (Mishra et al. 2015). Sedges provide habitat and a food source (e.g. fruits, tubers) for insects, birds and other animals, helping maintain faunal diversity (Mishra et al. 2015). Barrett (2013) found that at least ten species of Lepidosperma form the basis of the diet of twelve species of birds: three finch/firetail species, seven parrots, emu and Southern Emu-wren. Several genera of Australian Cyperaceae are also larval food plants for many Lepidoptera species. Many species of the moth genus Elachista use Lepidosperma laterale as a larval food plant (Kaila 2011). Many species of Hedge-skippers (Hesperilla) use Gahnia species as larval food plants, as well as Scleria species (Braby 2004). Aboriginal uses of Bolboschoenus (food source), Cyperus (corms eaten and used as medicine, fibre for weaving fishing nets, fish traps, baskets and dilly bags) and Lepidosperma (fibre for making baskets) are described by Smith (1991), Clarke (2013), and references therein. Other taxa were also used as a source of food (e.g. seeds of Gahnia) and in the production of baskets, mats, string and other implements."

These classifications recognise the lindsaeoid ferns as a separate subfamily or tribe, and sometimes distinguish also the dennstaedtioid ferns (Dennstaedtia , Microlepia , Leptolepia Prantland Saccoloma Kaulf.) from the hypolepidoid group (principally Hypolepis , Paesia St.Hil., Pteridium , Histiopteris , Blotiella R.M.Tryon and Lonchitis L.). The more divisive classifications of Nayar (1970) and Pichi-Sermolli (1977) recognise the Dennstaedtiaceae, Hypolepidaceae and Lindsaeaceae as three separate families. Cytologically, the Dennstaedtiaceae and Lindsaeaceae are extremely variable and include a range of base numbers between x = 26 and x = 48. Lovis (1977) suggested that evolution in the two groups may be the result of a long series of aneuploid reductions, perhaps from a source in the Cyatheaceae."

none are self-pollinating. diuris pollen is loosely aggregated within the pollinarium and segments are readily detached upon contact with a sticky stigma, meaning that a single pollinarium can pollinate several flowers. however, the number of diuris flowers that get pollinated can be very low. not a single flower was pollinated in a colony of around 130 flowering plants of orientis closely observed by the author at mt morton, victoria, during november 1969. in many diuris species, the central part of the flower (the dorsal sepal and the labellum lobes), closely mimic the flower shape of native pea-flowered shrubs (family fabaceae, tribe mirbelieae). the flowers of these shrubs produce nectar and are commonly visited by native bees and wasps. nectar is not produced by the diuris flowers, although most species have coloured markings on the labellum midlobe, which are suggestive of nectar guides. pollination studies of curvifolia [as maculata] (beardsell et al. 1986) and true maculata (indsto et al. 2006) show that bees seeking nectar or pollen are deceived into visiting the orchid flowers, and pollen removal or deposition occurs when the bees probe the basal part of the labellum and column while looking for nectar. the sticky gland on the pollinarium becomes attached to the face of the visiting bee, and sometimes bees can be seen with more than one gland attached to their faces. male and female bees are involved in the pollination of curvifolia and maculata, the males generally appearing in their life cycle before the females and visiting the orchids early in their flowering period. native leguminous shrubs with 'egg and bacon-type' flowers are common in habitats where diuris grow, and their flowering periods mostly overlap with that of the orchids. the flowers of species of bossiaea, daviesia, dillwynia and pultenaea have been linked with the pollination of diuris in the literature, but many other pea-flowered genera, including chorizema, gastrolobium, gompholobium, isotropis, jacksonia, nemcia and urodon, have similar flowers and may also play a role. not all diuris mimic pea-flowered shrubs. the flowers of diuris species in the alba /punctata group are often noticeably fragrant (fragrantissima for example) and do not bear a strong resemblance to native pea flowers, suggesting they employ a different strategy to lure insect visitors. a pollination study of alba shows that its flowers not only produce a small amount of nectar, but are attractive to insects in their own right (indsto et al. 2007). similarly, members of the behrii /chryseopsis group have distinctive semi-nodding flowers that are wider than they are long. they also have a large labellum midlobe that projects forwards like a landing platform, and a complex callus structure that is adorned with tiny, ne papillae. the flowers of behrii attract male lasioglossum bees, but not females (coleman 1932, bates 1977). these bees probe with their mouthparts into a narrow, deep, nectarless hollow between the base of the column and the labellum and have been observed to pick up pollinia. resting bees (lasioglossum species) have been found in the flowers of some species of diuris, including behrii, chryseopsis, monticola and subalpina, but their role in pollination, if any, remains unclear. the bees sit motionless in the flowers for long periods, sometimes even overnight, but they fly away if disturbed. perhaps the bees find security from predators under the hooded dorsal sepal, or maybe they gain warmth from the flowers at night. for an excellent treatment of pollination in diuris see bower (2001, pp.128-130). for photos of pollinia-bearing insects on various diuris flowers see kuiter (2013, pp.86-87). ;",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Tuberous terrestrial orchids growing as scattered individuals, in crowded tufts, or in clonal colonies.

Found in forested habitats and swampy areas, sometimes in peaty soil or in sites of litter accumulation. Species of Gastrodia are leafless and completely dependent on mycorrhizal fungi for their nutrients. A study isolating the fungi from rhizomes of G. sesamoides identified a range of species, the most common one being a wood-rotting saprophytic species of Campanella (family Marasmiaceae) (Dearnaley & Bougoure 2010). This study also indicated that Gastrodia sesamoides can exist efficiently in a relatively simple association with a range of fungi. The main components for its survival seem to be good supply of decaying wood and a compatible fungus. This study also showed very little fungal colonisation of cells in the rhizomes of G. sesamoides; 2 plants had no internal fungi at all. By contrast, some exotic species of Gastrodia have a much more specialised ecology which involves parasitizing their mycorrhizal fungi in an obligate mycoheterotrophic relationship. Gastrodia cunnighamii, native to New Zealand, is parasitic on the fungus Amarillaria novae-zealanidiae, and Gastrodia elata , which occurs in China, Japan and many other countries, is parasitic on up to 5 species of Amarillaria. The New Zealand species, Gastrodia minor, survives in a 3-way relationship with an ectomycorrhizal fungus and the myrtaceous shrub Manuka (Leptospermum scoparium). Some Australian species of Gastrodia may also have a similar 3-way relationship. Flowering is sometimes enhanced following summer fires, but fires in peaty soil may destroy the rhizomes. Feral pigs are known to dig up and eat the rhizomes. The rhizomes increase in length and produce side shoots when conditions are conducive for growth. The flower stem arises terminally on the rhizome in spring and summer in southern areas, and early in the wet season in tropical areas. Seeds are shed 4-8 weeks after pollination with capsules in an erect position.  The flowers release a spicy, cinnamon-like perfume which becomes very strong at about 25-30ƒ€¹…¡C. Each flower lasts 2 or 3 days and the labellum is entirely enclosed within the tubular flower. The flowers are pollinated by native bees of the genus Exoneura (family Anthophoridae) that are attracted to the flowers by the scent. These are partially social bees that collect and carry pollen between the hairs on their hind legs. An incentive for the bees to enter the Gastrodia flowers is provided in the form of fine, sugary, starch-enriched, yellow pseudopollen produced from the labellum callus within a day of the flower opening. Entry into the flower is upside-down from the top and the bees move directly to the labellum callus, scratching on the callus and pseudopollen.

Iodine tests show the pseudopollen is rich in starch and scrapings from the hind legs of the bees showed they carried pseudopollen from the orchid. Examination of labella from a range of Gastrodia species indicates that some may not produce pseudopollen or only small quantities. At least 2 species are self-pollinating.

Narrower-leaved populations of G. rosmarinifolia (in either subspecies) have the leaves strongly ascending and smooth or faintly granular. Recorded as growing in dry open forest. Flowering recorded for Apr., probably also spring months."

The 'typical form' occurs in Qld and N.T., and is a (?non-lignotuberous) fire-sensitive narrow-trunked shrub or tree with mostly smooth bark, narrow leaf lobes (usually J.R.Clarkson 5227 (BRI, K, NSW, QRS)) occurs in Qld on headlands and rocky peaks on Cape York N from c. 15ºS (parapatric with erect plants of the 'typical form'); it is a prostrate to procumbent shrub to 5 m across, with the habit retained in seedlings. The 'northern tree form', from northern N.T. and W.A., tends to develop with age a basal thickening of the stem akin to a lignotuber, and eventually a thick corky bark, allowing resprouting from the trunk and base after fire; the leaf lobes are variable in width and margins but are often coarse (> 3 mm wide) and recurved; the style is robust. A 'silver-leaved form' occurs in parts of Kakadu Natl Park, N.T., and has a persistent conspicuous appressed indumentum on the adaxial leaf surface; it is probably a minor local variant of the 'northern tree form'. Consistency of the features defining these forms is yet to be fully confirmed, as also the tendency for flower colour to deepen, and stylar diameter to increase, from the east to the west of the range. The species is often prolific in favourable sites and the flowers are an important nectar source for animals and in Aboriginal culture. It sets copious amounts of seed and has weed potential overseas. Grevillea pteridifolia hybridises readily with several other species and is a parent of several commercial hybrids. Regeneration variable, usually mainly from seeds, sometimes also lignotubers, occasionally also rhizomes and epicormic shoots. Grows in a wide range of habitats including eucalypt woodland, heath, and openings in sub-rainforest scrub; often in moister sites such as floodplains, near swamps or creeks but also on ridges and slopes; soils usually sandy or occasionally clay-loams.

Flora_of_Australia,Hibbertia,inconclusive genus-level observation; resprouts or regenerates from seed after fire,fire ecology varies from obligately resprouting to obligately reseeding after disturbance (usually fire).,"erect to prostrate or rarely mat-forming shrubs (rarely climbers or small trees), glabrous or with a vestiture of simple or fascicled (2-many-armed) hairs which are sometimes s and may be borne on tubercles. stems  terete or rarely flattened into cladodes (in subgen. pachynema). leaves well-developed or rarely reduced to scales or apparently absent, alternate (sometimes appearing fascicled when borne on short-shoots) or very rarely opposite (not in australia), simple, sessile (rarely perfoliate or amplexicaul) to shortly (rarely long-) petiolate, exstipulate, often with intrapetiolar tufts of hairs; lamina entire or rarely toothed or lobed, terete to flat, with margin flat to tightly recurved or revolute (the leaves then often sclerophyllous and ericoid), rarely involute; midrib prominent to apparently absent; apex retuse or obtuse to acute or pungent-pointed, straight or recurved. flowers sessile or pedicellate, terminal but often appearing leaf-opposed due to overgrowth of the flower-subtending shoot or axillary when terminal to a short-shoot, single or in bracteate, unbranched (rarely branched) pseudo-cincinnae. bracts 1-many, subtending the flower or borne on or at the base of the pedicel, herbaceous to scarious. sepals 5, quincuncial, slightly connate at base, usually somewhat accrescent, the outer often differing in shape, size or vestiture from the inner. petals 5 (rarely 1 or 2), free, quincuncial (when 5), actinomorphic or slightly zygomorphic, usually obovate and entire to distinctly emarginate, yellow (rarely white, orange, red or pink), caducous (rarely persistent). stamens 1-numerous, in a complete to interrupted ring (rarely in 2 or 3 distinct whorls) or in 2-5 groups around the carpels or in a group to one side of the carpels (then erect or curving over the gynoecium); filaments filiform or occasionally s (often stout in subgen. pachynema), free to almost completely connate when the stamens are in groups; anthers dehiscing by latrorse to introrse slits which may be short and terminal (the anthers then  porate) or as long as the locules; staminodes absent or present. carpels (1) 2-5 (-10); ovaries free, erect to spreading, glabrous to hairy or covered with scales, with terminal and usually excentric styles, 1-8-ovulate, the ovules tending to be basal when 1 or 2, marginal when many. fruit a follicle, rarely on an elongated gynophore; seeds usually  globular, endospermic, with an entire to fimbriate aril that may be short and basal to completely enclosing the seed and is semi-translucent to opaque-white or (rarely) fleshy and brightly red or orange; embryo usually poorly differentiated when the seed is shed. generic delimitation. hibbertia is currently classified into four subgenera (horn 2007, 2009): subgen. adrastaea (dc.) j.w.horn (1 sp.), subgen. hemistemma (juss. ex thouars) j.w.horn  circa 225 spp.), subgen. hibbertia  circa 90 spp.) and subgen. pachynema (r.br. ex dc.) j.w.horn  circa 12 spp.). the latter three have been further informally subdivided into species groups based on morphology by previous authors (e g, thiele 2019a, 2019b; toelken 2010, 2013; wheeler 2002, 2004). there is good preliminary molecular support for some species groups as monophyletic clades (see horn 2009; thiele 2019a). vestiture. hair morphology, length and density, particularly on stems, leaves, sepals and carpels, are highly varied in hibbertia and are important for distinguishing between species groups and discriminating some closely related species. hairs may be simple and unicellular or fascicled, i e comprising 2-many unicellular arms arising from a single point on the epidermis. when fascicled, the individual arms may be  equal in length or very unequal and may be spreading-erect, antrorsely-directed or flattened-radiate; in the latter case they are often variably fused to form peltate scales. fascicled hairs with two equal arms are called twinned hairs. a distinctive type of hair found on some species is simple, short and distinctly uncinate (called hooked hairs in the descriptions); these are often slightly to distinctly retrorse. both simple and few-armed fascicled hairs may be very short (the surface then being minutely scabrid) to long; in general, simple hairs form softer vestitures than fascicled hairs. fascicled hairs are often borne on rounded or sometimes elongate epidermal tubercles; hooked hairs may also be tuberculate at the base. only simple hairs are present in subgen. hibbertia, while fascicled hairs and hooked hairs are common in subgen. hemistemma. for more information on hairs in the genus, see discussions in horn (2007), thiele (2015) and toelken (1998, 2010, 2012, 2013). leaves. leaves vary from broadly orbicular to narrowly linear, with or without a prominent midrib below, and may be terete or have an expanded lamina; when laminate, the margin may be flat, recurved to revolute or (rarely) involute. many species in subgen. hemistemma have ericoid leaves, with the margin tightly recurved or revolute and often butting tightly against the midrib below. in such cases, the true abaxial leaf surface may be completely obscured in both fresh and dried specimens. stomata in all species are borne only on the abaxial surface; it is likely that in the many species with ericoid leaves, the whole leaf essentially acts as a stomate, with minor movements of the lamina margin towards or away from the midrib controlling water relations. in many such species the nature of the (largely hidden) abaxial surface is important for species discrimination, being either glabrous, distinctly papillate, or densely hairy. leaves on specimens may need to be broken to observe this feature. mature plants within subgen. pachynema appear leafless or have leaves reduced and s; only seedlings (or vigorously resprouting growth) bear ""normal"" leaves. inflorescence. most species have solitary, terminal flowers, which may be sessile or pedicellate (the flower stalks sometimes referred to as ""peduncles""). early growth of a subtending shoot from an axil of a subtending leaf or bract (see below) may render the flower leaf-opposed; the branch system when flowering is thus sympodial. flowers may also be borne (and sometimes closely aggregated) on short-shoots, in which case they appear axillary. several species groups in subgen. hemistemma have flowers borne in unusual bracteate inflorescences (thiele 2019b), here called pseudo-cincinnae (because their bract pattern indicates that they may not to be cymose like true cincinnae). in australia such inflorescences are usually unbranched, but in a distinctive new caledonian radiation they may be branched. floral bracts. flowers are usually subtended by one to several bracts that clearly comprise modified leaves but are morphologically distinct from normal leaves. the terminal (primary, flower-subtending) bract always lacks an axillary bud, while all distal bracts bear an axillary bud; growth of these buds (or axillary buds from upper leaves) continues the shoot axis sympodially. when pedicellate flowers are subtended by a single (primary) bract, the bract may be at the apex of the pedicel immediately below the calyx, at the base of the pedicel, or variably along the pedicel; the bract position in these cases is species-diagnostic. secondary bracts in pedicellate flowers are always at the base of the pedicel. bract texture varies between species, from herbaceous to distinctly scarious. secondary bracts may morphologically grade into normal leaves. in some species one to several leaves subtending a flower differ in size and shape from stem leaves. androecium. androecia in hibbertia are very diverse. stamens may be arranged all around, only on one side of, or rarely on opposite sides of, the carpels. species in subgen. hibbertia always have an actinomorphic androecium (the stamens arranged all around the gynoecium). by contrast, most species in subgen. hemistemma have a zygomorphic androecium, with the the stamens all on one side of the (usually two) carpels. the disposition of stamens (and styles) in both cases is highly diagnostic, presumably due to specialised pollination syndromes: in those members of subgen. hemistemma with a zygomorphic androecium, the stamens and styles may be erect, or the stamens may curve forwards over the carpels and their short, curved styles. in the latter case the androecium is reminiscent of a hand of bananas. when stamens are distributed all around the carpels they may be free in a single or multi-layered whorl, or in clusters (often between the carpels). the filaments in the latter case may be free or variously fused. staminodes (reduced, infertile stamens) are present in some species groups in subgen. hemistemma and pachynema (less often in subgen. hibbertia). the presence or absence, and positions when present, of the staminodes with respect to the stamens is always species-diagnostic. subgenus pachynema and subgen. adrastaea have 2 or 3 distinct whorls to the androecium, with the inner whorl of two stamens or staminodes that are alternate to the 2 carpels. the filaments of some species in subgen. pachynema are rounded and transversely thickened. most species are found in shrublands, woodlands and forests, with very few in alpine or desert regions. most species are likely to be principally bee-pollinated. some species may be pollinated by shield-bearing moths (heliozelidae), which also lay their eggs in the carpels. flower beetles are commonly seen on some species eating the anthers, pollen and carpels; it is not known whether these are effective pollinators. seed dispersal is likely to be by birds for those (few) species with red- or orange-coloured fleshy arils that enclose the seed, and by ants for species that have a reduced, usually translucent, aril, which may act as an elaiosome (stebbins & hoogland 1976). the seeds of some species have a long and complex seed dormancy (schatral et al. 1997, hidayati et al. 2012), the seeds at dispersal having a scarcely differentiated embryo. fire ecology varies from obligately resprouting to obligately reseeding after disturbance (usually fire). obligate reseeders mostly germinate readily, while obligate resprouters may be intractable germinators (hidayati et al. 2012). temperate species flower mostly in spring and early summer, sometimes with occasional flowering in response to rain at other times of the year; species in the monsoon tropics flower in the late wet and early dry season. ;",NA,NA,NA,resprouts fire_killed,direct_from_flora,post_fire_recruitment,direct_from_flora,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Erect to prostrate or rarely mat-forming shrubs (rarely climbers or small trees), glabrous or with a vestiture of simple or fascicled (2-many-armed) hairs which are sometimes scale-like and may be borne on tubercles.

Generic delimitation. Hibbertia is currently classified into four subgenera (Horn 2007, 2009): subgen. Adrastaea (DC.) J.W.Horn (1 sp.), subgen. Hemistemma (Juss. ex Thouars) J.W.Horn (c. 225 spp.), subgen. Hibbertia (c. 90 spp.) and subgen. Pachynema (R.Br. ex DC.) J.W.Horn (c. 12 spp.). The latter three have been further informally subdivided into species groups based on morphology by previous authors (e.g., Thiele 2019a, 2019b; Toelken 2010, 2013; Wheeler 2002, 2004). There is good preliminary molecular support for some species groups as monophyletic clades (see Horn 2009; Thiele 2019a). Vestiture. Hair morphology, length and density, particularly on stems, leaves, sepals and carpels, are highly varied in Hibbertia and are important for distinguishing between species groups and discriminating some closely related species. Hairs may be simple and unicellular or fascicled, i.e. comprising 2-many unicellular arms arising from a single point on the epidermis. When fascicled, the individual arms may be  equal in length or very unequal and may be spreading-erect, antrorsely-directed or flattened-radiate; in the latter case they are often variably fused to form peltate scales.

Fascicled hairs are often borne on rounded or sometimes elongate epidermal tubercles; hooked hairs may also be tuberculate at the base. Only simple hairs are present in subgen. Hibbertia, while fascicled hairs and hooked hairs are common in subgen. Hemistemma. For more information on hairs in the genus, see discussions in Horn (2007), Thiele (2015) and Toelken (1998, 2010, 2012, 2013). Leaves. Leaves vary from broadly orbicular to narrowly linear, with or without a prominent midrib below, and may be terete or have an expanded lamina; when laminate, the margin may be flat, recurved to revolute or (rarely) involute. Many species in subgen. Hemistemma have ericoid leaves, with the margin tightly recurved or revolute and often butting tightly against the midrib below.

Stomata in all species are borne only on the abaxial surface; it is likely that in the many species with ericoid leaves, the whole leaf essentially acts as a stomate, with minor movements of the lamina margin towards or away from the midrib controlling water relations. In many such species the nature of the (largely hidden) abaxial surface is important for species discrimination, being either glabrous, distinctly papillate, or densely hairy.

Pachynema appear leafless or have leaves reduced and scale-like; only seedlings (or vigorously resprouting growth) bear ""normal"" leaves. Inflorescence. Most species have solitary, terminal flowers, which may be sessile or pedicellate (the flower stalks sometimes referred to as ""peduncles""). Early growth of a subtending shoot from an axil of a subtending leaf or bract (see below) may render the flower leaf-opposed; the branch system when flowering is thus sympodial. Flowers may also be borne (and sometimes closely aggregated) on short-shoots, in which case they appear axillary. Several species groups in subgen. Hemistemma have flowers borne in unusual bracteate inflorescences (Thiele 2019b), here called pseudo-cincinnae (because their bract pattern indicates that they may not to be cymose like true cincinnae). In Australia such inflorescences are usually unbranched, but in a distinctive New Caledonian radiation they may be branched. Floral bracts. Flowers are usually subtended by one to several bracts that clearly comprise modified leaves but are morphologically distinct from normal leaves. The terminal (primary, flower-subtending) bract always lacks an axillary bud, while all distal bracts bear an axillary bud; growth of these buds (or axillary buds from upper leaves) continues the shoot axis sympodially. When pedicellate flowers are subtended by a single (primary) bract, the bract may be at the apex of the pedicel immediately below the calyx, at the base of the pedicel, or variably along the pedicel; the bract position in these cases is species-diagnostic. Secondary bracts in pedicellate flowers are always at the base of the pedicel. Bract texture varies between species, from herbaceous to distinctly scarious. Secondary bracts may morphologically grade into normal leaves. In some species one to several leaves subtending a flower differ in size and shape from stem leaves. Androecium. Androecia in Hibbertia are very diverse. Stamens may be arranged all around, only on one side of, or rarely on opposite sides of, the carpels. Species in subgen. Hibbertia always have an actinomorphic androecium (the stamens arranged all around the gynoecium). By contrast, most species in subgen. Hemistemma have a zygomorphic androecium, with the the stamens all on one side of the (usually two) carpels. The disposition of stamens (and styles) in both cases is highly diagnostic, presumably due to specialised pollination syndromes: in those members of subgen. Hemistemma with a zygomorphic androecium, the stamens and styles may be erect, or the stamens may curve forwards over the carpels and their short, curved styles. In the latter case the androecium is reminiscent of a hand of bananas. When stamens are distributed all around the carpels they may be free in a single or multi-layered whorl, or in clusters (often between the carpels). The filaments in the latter case may be free or variously fused. Staminodes (reduced, infertile stamens) are present in some species groups in subgen. Hemistemma and Pachynema (less often in subgen. Hibbertia). The presence or absence, and positions when present, of the staminodes with respect to the stamens is always species-diagnostic. Subgenus Pachynema and subgen. Adrastaea have 2 or 3 distinct whorls to the androecium, with the inner whorl of two stamens or staminodes that are alternate to the 2 carpels. The filaments of some species in subgen. Pachynema are rounded and transversely thickened. Most species are found in shrublands, woodlands and forests, with very few in alpine or desert regions. Most species are likely to be principally bee-pollinated. Some species may be pollinated by shield-bearing moths (Heliozelidae), which also lay their eggs in the carpels. Flower beetles are commonly seen on some species eating the anthers, pollen and carpels; it is not known whether these are effective pollinators. Seed dispersal is likely to be by birds for those (few) species with red- or orange-coloured fleshy arils that enclose the seed, and by ants for species that have a reduced, usually translucent, aril, which may act as an elaiosome (Stebbins & Hoogland 1976). The seeds of some species have a long and complex seed dormancy (Schatral et al. 1997, Hidayati et al. 2012), the seeds at dispersal having a scarcely differentiated embryo. Fire ecology varies from obligately resprouting to obligately reseeding after disturbance (usually fire). Obligate reseeders mostly germinate readily, while obligate resprouters may be intractable germinators (Hidayati et al. 2012). Temperate species flower mostly in spring and early summer, sometimes with occasional flowering in response to rain at other times of the year; species in the monsoon tropics flower in the late wet and early dry season."

The culm angles are marked by thickening of the subepidermal sclerenchyma as well as a group of sclerides in the chlorenchyma and a vascular bundle in the angle, rather than being due to enlargement of epidermal cells as occurs in some other Restionaceae (Cytogonidium, Dielsia) with angled stems. Ribbing of the faces of the stem is over outer vascular bundles. Reduced leaves on rhizomes are referred to as scales; reduced leaves on the culm as sheaths; spathes are the primary bracts subtending the inflorescence or inflorescence branches. Peg cells are palisade-like chlorenchyma cells with lines of peg-like projections that meet the similar projections of adjacent cells. Cluster roots form clusters of closely spaced short lateral rootlets; they may form a mat just beneath the soil surface and are mostly found in plants of oligotrophic sites.

Several species of Microtis use either self-pollination or apomixis as a fail-safe strategy to ensure seed development (Bates 1981, 1983, 1984b). The process of self-pollination is relatively simple and easily observed. The stigma is situated immediately below the anther with the two organs separated by a thin, almost vestigial rostellum. The pollinarium consists of 2 pairs of pollinia connected either directly, or via a short hamulus, to a viscidium which is in contact with the rostellum. These organs are separate when the flower first opens, but swell and soften with age, eventually coming into contact (usually 2-4 days after opening), after which the pollen germinates and brings about fertilisation. Though self pollination and apomixis are the primary pollination strategies for several species of Microtis, the flowers of many species are scented and most species, if not all, produce nectar which gathers in a small well (nectary) at the base of the column. Nectar is sometimes also produced in droplets on the labellum where it can smear or coalesce. The nectar attracts a range of visitors and ensures some degree of outcrossing to maintain diversity. Insect visitors to Microtis flowers include several species of small ants which seem to be significant pollinators in this genus (Jones, 1975, Peakall & Beattie, 1989 - see M. parviflora for more details). Other small insects that visit the flowers include flies (Syrphidae, Sciaridae), beetles (Chrysomelidae, Curculionidae) and small wasps (Ichneumonidae, Braconidae, Bethylidae), some of which can bring about limited pollination (Bates 1981, Kuiter 2013, 2017). Some of these insects have been observed to remove pollinaria from freshly opened flowers and are capable of carrying out limited pollination, but the process of autogamy/apomixis impedes the removal of pollinaria from flowers more than 1 or 2 days old. The author has observed small dark weevils of an undescribed genus removing and depositing pollinaria from freshly opened flowers of M. oblonga, M. parviflora and M. unifolia while feeding on labellum nectar.

however, they can also be found in subtropical and temperate rainforests, littoral rainforests and mangroves fringing rivers and estuaries. a few live in the drier scrub of the kimberley, the gulf of carpentaria, cape york and the western slopes of new south wales. large epiphytes usually grow on the trunks and more substantial branches of trees, as they can become quite weighty and require more support. small epiphytes may also be found on main trunks, or further out in the canopy. some tiny specialised species (twig epiphytes) grow almost exclusively on the small branches and twigs of the outer canopy. several epiphytic orchids also grow on boulders, rock outcrops and cliff faces within the forest or along its margins, occasionally in quite exposed situations. terrestrial orchids favour the dry summers and mild, wet winters of temperate regions and are less abundant in the tropics. most terrestrial orchids are deciduous (having a dormant period), and those that grow in the tropics are usually found in areas that experience marked fluctuations in precipitation during the year. terrestrials that live in wet tropical forests are usually evergreen. australian native terrestrial orchids have adapted to a wide range of habitats and soil types. while the greatest diversity occurs in the sclerophyll forests of the south, terrestrial orchids can also be found in coastal swamps, dunes and heathlands; mallee scrub and heathlands; native pine (callitris) and sheoak (casuarina) forests; grasslands; and western australia's sandplain heath. subalpine regions of the southeastern mainland and tasmania support many unique terrestrial species. subalpine habitats include snow gum forests, moist grasslands, high altitude meadows, button-grass plains, moors and fens; a few species even survive in windswept alpine tundra. soils in these cool regions are moist to wet for much of the year. along the tropical and subtropical east coast, a few terrestrial orchids occur in rainforest, while others have adapted to the high tablelands and mountains where the climate is modified by altitude. within a given area, different terrestrial orchid species inhabit different microclimates - some favour exposed slopes and ridges; others grow in shade on sheltered slopes, embankments, gullies and beside watercourses. for details on the biology of orchids see chapter 3 in jones (2021: 30-41). the majority of the world's orchids grow as epiphytes on trees, enabling them to take advantage of the increased light and air movement available in the microclimate of the tree canopy, compared with the forest floor. epiphytic orchids are not parasites; they live independently of the host tree, creating sugars through photosynthesis, and obtaining nutrients from animal droppings, detritus and compounds leached from the bark of the host. rock-dwelling species are known as lithophytes, but it is not uncommon for epiphytes to also grow on rocks if the prevailing climate is suitable for their survival. to cope with harsh climatic conditions, such as regular dry seasons or exposed sites, some epiphytic orchids use a metabolic system known as crassulacean acid metabolism (cam), rather than c3 or c4 photosynthesis. cam allows plants to capture and store solar energy during the day, then complete the process of photosynthesis at night, when humidity is higher and plants are at less risk of desiccation. in contrast, many terrestrial orchids have a dormant period which allows them to withstand unsuitable climatic conditions. the plants die back to a fleshy underground tuber and regrow again when conditions become suitable. some terrestrial orchids are evergreen, with leaves present all year; these generally grow in habitats that are consistently moist. orchids have evolved a wide range of strategies to encourage cross-pollination of their flowers. these include food rewards, food deception (pretending to offer a reward, often by mimicking other flowers) and sexual deception (pretending to be a desirable mate). orchids are pollinated by various creatures, including birds, beetles, moths, flies, ants, bees and wasps. orchids often provide examples of co-evolution, e g between the madagascan endemic darwin's orchid angraecum sesquipedale, with its long flower nectar spur, and a specialised moth-pollinator, with its long proboscis to reach the nectar. several australian native orchids also produce seeds after self-pollination (the seeds are fertilised by the individual's own pollen without the intervention of a pollinator). many native orchids, especially terrestrials, have evolved vegetative (asexual) methods of reproduction, allowing the plants to spread and form colonies. plants that are produced asexually are genetically identical to the parent plant. the seeds of most orchids are  and are usually dispersed on the wind. however, the fruit of rhizanthella species (underground orchids) are unusual; they don't dehisce but develop into fleshy, b fruit that contain comparatively large, hard seeds. these fleshy fruits are probably eaten by truffle-seeking mammals, then the seeds are dispersed in their dung. the minute seeds of orchids lack any nutrients and require inoculation by a mycorrhizal fungus to provide nutrients for germination and growth. an orchid species may associate with just a single fungus species, but some use a range of fungal partners. some orchids continue to rely on mycorrhizal relationships throughout their lifetime. several orchid species lack chlorophyll and cannot photosynthesise; they are called mycoheterotrophs and gain the nutrients they need by parasitising ectomycorrhizal fungi. fire is an integral part of australian ecology, and many native terrestrial orchids have developed adaptations to cope with its effects. numerous terrestrial species flower profusely in the growing season after a fire, and some even rely on fire to stimulate flowering. for terrestrials, if a fire occurs during the period where the orchid has retreated to an underground tuber, it may be protected - depending on the severity of the fire and the depth of the tuber. however, fires which occur while the orchid is growing above ground or flowering may result in mortality. in contrast, epiphytic orchids (which typically occur in wetter forests that rarely burn) are likely to be killed outright if they are burnt. epiphytes rely on seeds distributed from unburnt areas to recolonise burnt habitats. orchids are increasingly threatened by a variety of pressures. these include over-collecting, destruction by feral animals, climate change, and habitat loss or fragmentation due to activities such as logging, construction and agriculture. specialised relationships with pollinators and mycorrhizal fungi make orchids particularly vulnerable because these organisms are also subject to pressures of habitat loss and climate change. the unique biology of orchids and their specialised relationships pose considerable challenges for their conservation. ;",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Terrestrial, epiphytic, epilithic or climbing, sometimes mycoheterotrophic, perennial herbs;

For terrestrials, if a fire occurs during the period where the orchid has retreated to an underground tuber, it may be protected - depending on the severity of the fire and the depth of the tuber. However, fires which occur while the orchid is growing above ground or flowering may result in mortality. In contrast, epiphytic orchids (which typically occur in wetter forests that rarely burn) are likely to be killed outright if they are burnt. Epiphytes rely on seeds distributed from unburnt areas to recolonise burnt habitats. Orchids are increasingly threatened by a variety of pressures. These include over-collecting, destruction by feral animals, climate change, and habitat loss or fragmentation due to activities such as logging, construction and agriculture. Specialised relationships with pollinators and mycorrhizal fungi make orchids particularly vulnerable because these organisms are also subject to pressures of habitat loss and climate change. The unique biology of orchids and their specialised relationships pose considerable challenges for their conservation."

Sterile florets: lemma ovate to lanceolate, (1.5-) 2-4 (-5) mm long, acuminate (often longacuminate to aristate) or subulate, glabrous or midnerve and/or margins scaberulous. Bisexual floret: lemma mostly obovate, (6-) 6.5-9 mm long, awned, coriaceous to cartilaginous, 5-nerved; lemma awn (30-) 60-150 mm long, terete to subterete; palea (5.5-) 6.5-8 (-8.5) mm long, with awn c. 0.3-1 mm long; anthers 1.3-2.5 (-3) mm long; stigmas blackish purple or brown. Caryopsis lanceoloid to oblanceoloid or obloid-ellipsoidal, laterally compressed, (5-) 5.5-7.5 (-8.3) mm long. Oryza meridionalis is sometimes treated as a synonym of O. rufipogon, see notes under that species. These AA genome wild rice species are sometimes distinguished by their panicles: O. meridionalis often has contracted panicles with branches  appressed (sometimes later spreading) and secondary branching is rare, while O. rufipogon usually has open panicles (Lu & Jackson 2004: 17 & 28). Grows in shallow or sometimes deeper water, in aquatic to drying conditions, on margins of lagoons, waterholes and creeks, in depressions, temporary pools, drainage channels, grasslands, swamps, including seasonal swamps, often in cracking clay (sometimes in loams and sandy soils) and on floodplains.  A study on the role of fire in germinating the annual wild rice Oryza meridionalis and threats to its wetland habitats from exotic grass invasions is provided by Williams et al. (2011).  Flowers March-June."

Pistil can appear cryptically perfect with the ovary and style both about 4 mm long, the ovary with nil or few ovules. Although dioecious, most male plants produce the occasional fruit.

Declared a weed in Victoria. Restricting horticultural plantings to just male plants is not a solution as most of these plants also produce occasional fruits; all forms are self-compatible and plants range from dioecious to monoecious. Neither the recent morphological nor the DNA analyses are informative on the affinities of this species. Noticeably the two truly wide-ranging/weedy Pittosporum species in Australia (P. undulatum and P. ferrugineum) both display the full spectrum of sex strategies from unisexual flowers with staminode or pistillode tissue, to perfect and clearly viable bisexual flowers, often in the same inflorescence. Hybrids are becoming more frequent between Pittosporum bicolor and P. undulatum as the latter continues its range expansion. Pittosporum bicolor has rather narrow elliptic leaves with a persistent indumentum on the undersurface, maroon streaked yellow flowers and black fruits with red seeds. Hybrids between these two taxa tend to have bicolor foliage (although wider and often longer), undulatum flowers (complete with vestigial staminodes) and fruits with orange seeds. For an account of Pittosporum undulatum on Norfolk and Lord Howe Islands, where introduced and escaped from cultivation, see Green (1994: 158). In 1956, R.C. Cooper stated that Pittosporum undulatum was naturally occurring in marginal rainforest throughout the coastal ranges of southeastern Australia. Grows in wet sclerophyll to sheltered dry sclerophyll forests and scrubs. This species presents its seeds attractively packaged and cohering for easy bird dispersal; seed production on female trees is enormous. Pittosporum undulatum has a vigorous rhizomatous root system which survives all but the most intense wild fires, and a habit of holding the large leaves of its coppice growth horizontal blocks light for other seeds to germinate. This ensures very rapid colonisation, particularly on disturbed sites (Gleadow 1982). For details on biology and ecology see Mullett (2009) and references therein. Peak flowering in spring."

Male spikelets narrow acute-ovoid, 4-5 mm long; glumes lanceolate, acute, dull tan-brown, glabrous or very shortly ciliate, to 4 mm long, lower glumes shorter. Female spikelets ovoid, 5-7 mm long, 2-3 mm wide, with 9-15 sterile lower glumes and 1 or 2 fertile upper glumes; glumes similar to males; a few of the lowest glumes with a very short, blunt mucro. Male flowers: tepals 6, narrow-lanceolate, hyaline, glabrous; 2 outer tepals keeled, 3-3.5 mm long; 3rd outer tepal and inner tepals flat, slightly shorter; stamens 3; filaments c. 1 mm long, anthers c. 1.3-1.8 mm long, not exserted. Female flowers: tepals 6, concave, glabrous, red-brown with broad hyaline margin, lanceolate, acute, 3-5 mm long; staminodes 3; ovary trilocular; styles 3, shortly connate at the base. Capsule trilocular, c. 1.2 mm long. Seed ellipsoid, c. 0.9 mm long, pale brown. The seed surface of slightly convex, isodiametric cells differs from the seeds of Chordifex which are mostly colliculate with lines of convex cells, and from the flat rectangular cells of Tremulina. Reduced leaves on horizontal rhizomes are referred to as scales; reduced leaves on the culm as sheaths. Peg cells are palisade-like chlorenchyma cells with lines of peg-like projections that meet the similar projections of adjacent cells. Girders are sclerenchyma ridges opposite the outer vascular bundles, extending from the sclerenchyma sheath all or part-way through the chlorenchyma. Cluster roots form clusters of closely spaced short lateral rootlets; they may form a mat just beneath the soil surface and are mostly found in plants of oligotrophic sites. An informative online interactive key to the Western Australian species of Restionaceae, with abundant photographs, is given by Hollister & Thiele (2014). Grows on stream banks, in moist peaty sand in sedgeland with tall shrubs; sites constantly moist with considerable seepage through the substrate. Killed by fire; regeneration is by seed. Wind-pollinated. Flowers November."

Slater thought the 'curious object might be of orchidaceous character' and sent the specimen together with the Dipodium plants to Mr & Mrs Frederick J.

Other diverse habitats include wet sclerophyll forest, littoral rainforest and streambank vegetation with species of Syncarpia and Tristaniopsis. Soils are mostly freely draining sand or loam. Apart from the general importance of myrtaceous plants, no tree or shrub species forms a common link between the localities. Most of the details of the biology of this species, which is very similar to that outlined for Rhizanthella gardneri, have come from the research carried out by Mark Clements for the Centre for Plant Biodiversity Research in Canberra. Mark has kindly made the results of his studies freely available for my use. Plants of R. slateri can occur singly, but most often form clumps comprising single or conjoined rhizomes at a depth of 20-25 cm underground. Growth occurs all year round, but fluctuates in response to rain. Plants occur in various stages of development with new and old growths present on the same plant. Rhizomes consist of a series of internodes with meristematic buds at the nodes, each subtended by a small bract. New lateral rhizomes arise from these buds. The basal area where it is attached to the parent rhizome is only a few millimeters wide, but older parts reach 10-15 mm across. The narrow basal connection is easily broken, but separated parts can develop individually. Excavations of several plants revealed an interconnected labyrinth of multiple decaying, mature, developing and immature rhizomes up to 25 cm apart at the furthest points. In one case up to 27 individual rhizomes (plants) were found in an area of about 250 cm2. Rhizomes first develop laterally, flowering when large enough. Prior to flowering, the apex of the largest rhizomes grow towards the soil surface, taking 4 to 6 months before developing a capitulum that just emerges at the soil surface under the litter layer, anytime between January and October. Flowering occurs from August to early November. The capitulum, which is slightly funnel-shaped, consists of an outer layer of sterile sheathing bracts and a series of spirally arranged individual flowers (up to 30), each subtended by a floral bract. Individual flowers are tubular, creamy white, maturing to pink, red or maroon with the sepals and petals held close together, the triangular labellum protruding between them. Rhizanthella slateri is pollinated by small microdipterans (gnats), possibly attracted by a mushroom-like odour. They enter the open flower, possibly deceived into laying eggs or seeking nectar, and pick up a pollinarium on the thorax when leaving the flower. Deposition on the stigma occurs when visiting another flower. The percentage of pollination observed in flowerheads is unusually high (70-100%), indicating an efficient system and a strong attraction for the pollinators. Self-pollination has been ruled out because cultivated plants grown out of their natural habitat do not produce capsules. Pollinated flowers develop into fleshy, indehiscent drupes that take 11-12 months to mature. At first the cream-coloured ovaries develop below the ground surface, enlarging to a cluster of fleshy, yellow, aromatic drupes at or near the soil surface but under the litter layer. The ripe berry-like fruit contain dark brown sclerotic seeds, 16-900 per fruit. Seed dispersal is probably by truffle-eating animals such as swamp wallabies and bandicoots feeding on the ripe fruit, or birds such as choughs and bower birds, the seeds passing through the gut and being dispersed in dung. The impact of a bushfire at Alum Mountain showed that Rhizanthella flowerheads covered by thick litter were destroyed, eliminating seed production for that year, but the rhizomes, which were more deeply buried, regrew below the damaged tissue.

Highly localised, growing in heath and heathy forest developed on sandstone in freely draining to moisture-retentive sand and sandy clay loam. The plants commonly grow in open sites, often on margins of sandstone outcrops or in shallow soil in rock fissures or over rock plates, less commonly in moss under tall shrubs. Notes Remarkable in that growth cycle is completely the reverse of all other members of the genus. The rosettes emerge first in autumn and the inflorescences develop in spring. Rosettes actually develop from the parent (old) tuber and the flower stem is produced from the new replacement tuber, while both tubers are still connected. In all other species of Speculantha the rosette arises after flowering and is borne on a lateral growth from the base of the flower stem, often after flowering is finished. The rosettes of S. vernalis are always present at flowering time and new rosettes can subsequently develop on lateral growths which arise from the base of the inflorescence. The spring flowering period is also notable since related species flower in summer, autumn and early winter. Flowering is promoted in the season following summer fires. Aug-Nov."

In many species, particularly those with inflorescences greatly exceeding the foliage, the spikes elongate markedly during development; in the descriptions below, length of spike and flower density are taken at an early- to mid-flowering stage. The flowers are scentless or in some species possibly faintly scented. At anthesis the anthers and stigma are held tightly together under tension; on being touched, the stigma flicks across and the pollen is ejected (as in Conospermum ).

Column 4-7 x 3-4mm, white or bluish with yellow apex and broad blackish apical collar; post-anther lobe short, 3-lobed, yellow-tipped, dorsal surface with few short erect finger-like papillae; auxiliary lobes broad, higher than post-anther lobe; column arms projecting to obliquely erect, often touching, 1.5-2.5mm long; hair-tufts toothbrush-like, dense, white, hairs c.1mm long. Widespread from the coast to the foothills and high mountains where often locally common in wetter habitats, especially on slopes and ridges in high rainfall forests, including snowgum woodland, wet sclerophyll forest and dense shrubby open forest; less commonly found in coastal heath. Soils range from moisture-retentive sands to shallow clay loam and deep rich well-structured mountain loam. Notes A majestic and imposing orchid that produces memorable floral displays. Long-lasting insect-pollinated flowers are scented and open freely in warm to hot weather. Flowering strongly enhanced by summer fires. Poll. By a fast-flying native bee that lands on the column and works between the hair tufts with movements of the abdomen. Flies away with the pollinarium attached on the upper side of one of the last two abdominal segments (Jones 1981). Notes The five species in this group are attractive sun orchids with slender habit, freely opening blue flowers with darker blue longitudinal veins in the perianth segments and column with well-developed post-anther lobe that hoods the anther, flanked on either side by well-developed fleshy auxiliary lobes that are often ornamented in the same way as the post-anther lobe. The lateral lobes (column arms) have terminal tuft of variously coloured hairs. All species are apparently pollinated by insects, probably native bees. For a review of the group see Jeanes (2001).

Seeds with longitudinal lines of flat, rectangular or rhombic cells which are transverse or oblique to the long axis of the seed. Culm with chlorenchyma of 3 or 4 layers of short peg cells, interrupted opposite some outer vascular bundles by sclerenchyma girders extending from parenchyma sheath to epidermis; pillar and protective cells absent; central cavity present. Reduced leaves on the culm are referred to as sheaths; cataphylls are erect leaves at the base of the culms. Peg cells are palisade-like chlorenchyma cells with lines of peg-like projections that meet the similar projections of adjacent cells. Pillar cells are elongate, palisade-like cells of the parenchyma sheath, usually with moderately thickened walls, radiating from the sclerenchyma sheath to the epidermis, dividing the chlorenchyma into longitudinal bands. Girders are sclerenchyma ridges opposite the outer vascular bundles, extending from the sclerenchyma sheath all or part-way through the chlorenchyma. Protective cells are modified chlorenchyma cells that are thick-walled and line the substomatal cavity (Cutler 1969). Tremulina shows a flavonoid pattern distinct from that of Chordifex and other allied genera (Williams et al. 1998), including chrysoeriol as well as the more widely found luteolin.  An informative online interactive key to the Western Australian species of Restionaceae, with abundant photographs, is given by Hollister & Thiele (2014).
