  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: adult juvenile
  sampling_strategy: This dataset is sourced from the Flora of Australia online website
    (version date 2022-09-14). Briefly, the textual descriptions of each taxon were
    downloaded and organised into a tabular format of individual taxon names and their
    corresponding text using R coding script. Sentences mentioning the words 'burn'
    or 'fire' were extracted and manually scored to match relevant traits in AusTraits.
    Unclassified taxa were inferred, where possible, as possessing a trait value from
    a higher-level taxonomic description, e.g. all taxa in the Glischrocaryon genus
    were classified as resprouts, which was mentioned only in the genus description.
    All below-species-level taxa were also inferred from species-level values where
    possible.
