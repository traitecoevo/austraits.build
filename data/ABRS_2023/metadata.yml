  description: Plant growth form data extracted from the Flora of Australia online
    website.
  basis_of_record: preserved_specimen
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: This dataset is sourced from the The Flora of Australia online
    website (version date 2022-09-14). Briefly, the textual descriptions of each taxon
    were downloaded and organised into a tabular format of individual taxon names
    and their corresponding text using R coding script. Sentences and phrases were
    categorised using a large glossary of botanical terminology as referring to one
    of the following, the entire organism, stem, leaf, flower, fruit/seed, roots and
    environment/habitat. Key terms corresponding to trait values in AusTraits were
    then extracted from these smaller chunks of text using a reference table containing
    a) the AusTraits trait name, b) the AusTraits trait value and c) terms to search
    for in the text. The resulting traits were then checked manually using a subset
    of ~500 taxa to search for errors and update the reference table and coding script
    accordingly. The process was repeated iteratively to remove any wrongly classified
    trait values and to ensure as many correct trait values as possible were captured
    using the algorithm. Where possible, unclassified taxa were inferred as possessing
    a trait value from a higher-level taxonomic description e.g. the fruit type of
    all taxa in the Adenanthos genus were scored as `achene`, which was mentioned
    only in the genus description.
