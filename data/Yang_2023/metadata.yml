    online state and national floras and the taxonomic literature.
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: This dataset is sourced from Australia's online state and national
    floras and the taxonomic literature. Briefly, the textual descriptions of each
    taxon were downloaded and organised into a tabular format of individual taxon
    names and their corresponding text using R coding script. Sentences mentioning
    the words 'burn' or 'fire' were extracted and manually scored to match relevant
    traits in AusTraits. Unclassified taxa were inferred, where possible, as possessing
    a trait value from a higher-level taxonomic description, e.g. all taxa in the
    Glischrocaryon genus were classified as resprouts, which was mentioned only in
    the genus description. All below-species-level taxa were also inferred from species-level
    values where possible.
