  description: A government report collating information on the ecological attributes
    of 80 fire-sensitive systems in the South Coast region of Western Australia.
  basis_of_record: field literature
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: Southern Prospects, the South Coast Strategy for Natural Resource
    Management, identified that the South Coast region has many fire sensitive ecosystems
    occurring on public and private land; that inappropriate fire regimes were a significant
    threatening process impacting on biodiversity; and that more information was required
    to adequately manage and conserve these systems. This project identifies a preliminary
    list of 80 fire sensitive systems and collates information on their ecological
    attributes that will directly assist their management. The response to fire and
    rate of maturation rates of flora species is documented where known.

    description: The coastal granite features of West Cape Howe, Albany to Manypeaks,
      the Bremer peninsulas, and Esperance to Point Malcolm. This Ecodistrict contains
      vegetation communities similar in structure and often taxa, including many that
      are endemic, localised or restricted. These include particular mallet and mallee
      systems as well as kwongan heathlands.
  Albany Fraser Inland East:

    description: A mosaic of inland hills of the Esperance area and includes sub-coastal
      features as well as Mounts Ridley, Ney and Burdett to the north of Esperance.
      The laterised sheets surrounding the hills are included in this Ecodistrict.
      This Ecodistrict is similar to Albany Fraser Inland West in that it also contains
      many localised endemic plants although it is appreciably more arid with shrubbier
      plant communities. Inland it is further surrounded by the Mallee Lakes Ecodistrict
      of internal drainages on Eocene sediments.
  Albany Fraser Inland West:
    latitude (deg): -32
    longitude (deg): 120
    latitude range (deg): -32.5 to -35.3

    description: A visible western zone of the South Coast region that includes low
      sub-coastal granite hills, inland to the Porongurup Range and Mounts Barker,
      Lindesay, and Frankland. A significant although scattered Ecodistrict, it contains
      wetter forest and woodland habitats and occurrences of many locally endemic
      plants, relictual communities related to climatic conditions, and rare and threatened
      animals. Note, The Ecodistrict map is not sufficiently detailed to show the
      western occurrences of this district e.g. Mt Lindesay and the numerous granite
      islands that occur with the western Forest Mosaic.

    state: WA
    description: The granite island system that includes all offshore islands except
      Red Island, (a quartzite feature) off the central Barrens coast. These islands
      support vegetation systems commonly exclusive in nature and important habitat
      for mammals, some endemic and relictual species no longer found on the adjacent
      mainland and marine animals which require land for parts of their lives.

    description: A narrow strip of the most recently formed landscape units of Aeolian
      limestone, dunes, swales and estuary edges. These support woodlands of peppermint,
      Melaleuca, yandil (Eucalyptus cornuta), yate and mallet; and shrubland of Hakea,
      peppermint, Spyridium and wattle, and often an understorey of restiods and annuals.
      These vegetation systems are able to withstand more frequent disturbance having
      adapted to these recent and more dynamic landscape units. Note, This unit is
      not mapped.

    description: The eastern division of the Esperance plain to the east of the Lort
      River drainage is typified by its uncoordinated or very short coastal drainage
      and junction with the Albany Fraser province that underlies it. Mallee and Banksia
      shrubland dominate with interspersed kwongan heath, and wetland palusplain and
      freshwater systems.
  Esperance Sandplain West:
    latitude (deg): -32
    longitude (deg): 120
    latitude range (deg): -32.5 to -35.3
    longitude range (deg): 116.7 to 124.5
    state: WA
    description: The western division of the dominant Esperance plain is typified
      by its coordinated drainages and junction with the Yilgarn Block, which dips
      south under it. It runs from an Ecodistrict junction at East Mt Barren and the
      Jerdacuttup Fault at Culham Inlet east to the eastern divide of the Lort River
      drainage system. It comprises kwongan heathlands, Banksia and mallee shrubland
      and wetland chains including the Lake Shaster system.

    description: The extreme south western corner of the region where the wettest
      forests on deepest organic soils contain significant mixtures of relictual Gondwanan
      plants and animals including karri and tingle, red-flowering gum, frogs and
      trapdoor spiders. The mosaic of this Ecodistrict also contains several classes
      of wetlands from estuaries to winter wet swamps.
  Greenstone:
    latitude (deg): -32

    description: The Ravensthorpe Range and nearby associated hills. These are unique
      on the South Coast and their geological difference, metamorphic relationship
      with the adjoining quartzite system, a unique nodular limestone presence, and
      proximity to three additional Ecodistricts make it one of the most intense occurrences
      of plant diversity in south-western Australia, with woodland, mallet, mallee
      and heath communities. It intriguingly has outliers of the goldfield floral
      elements and contains intense mineralisation and as such is subject to exploration
      and mining activity.
  Mallee Lakes:
    latitude (deg): -32
    longitude (deg): 120
    latitude range (deg): -32.5 to -35.3

    description: A mosaic eco-district inland from Esperance comprising the paleodrainages
      marine sediment systems and their internal lake drainages. This Ecodistrict
      is similar to the marine plain Ecodistrict further west although it lacks it's
      relatively large coordinated drainages. It is dominated by mallee woodlands
      and shrubland, mallet woodlands and scattered kwongan heathlands on calcareous
      sandy soils.
  Marine plain:
    latitude (deg): -32
    longitude (deg): 120

    longitude range (deg): 116.7 to 124.5
    state: WA
    description: A western manifestation of the Eocene sediments between Albany and
      Ravensthorpe, this district has coordinated drainage systems that have formed
      linear alluvial and breakaway colluvial soils that in addition to the several
      duplex soils support a range of exclusive vegetation communities including kwongan
      shrublands and mallet and moort woodlands. The impact of the drainage system's
      erosive and development forces in carving through the substrate have created
      new landscapes that support a great diversity of habitats and vegetation.
  Northwest Mosaic:
    latitude (deg): -32
    longitude (deg): 120
    latitude range (deg): -32.5 to -35.3
    longitude range (deg): 116.7 to 124.5
    state: WA
    description: Wetter climates in the west give rise to coordinated drainage systems,
      often fresh, as well as slightly less diverse vegetation types than the Yilgarn
      Block East. It includes woodlands of jarrah, marri, wandoo, brown mallet, york
      gum, yate and swamp sheoak; as well as shrubland, kwongan heathlands and wetlands
      both fresh and saline.
  Nuytsland:
    latitude (deg): -32

    description: A linear coastal and sub-coastal Ecodistrict that extends along the
      coast of the western Great Australian Bight from just south of Israelite Bay
      west to Point Malcolm. It is typified by the recent Pliocene shoreline and Aeolian
      limestone, sand dunes and linear saline lake systems with Acacia and mallee
      shrubland and kwongan heathlands. It forms the fine coastal corridor that extends
      the southwestern botanical district to its easternmost
  Quartzite:
    latitude (deg): -32

    description: One of the most dramatic landforms of the South Coast are the omnipresent
      Stirling Range, Barrens and Russell Range/Mt Ragged. These metamorphosed sedimentary
      rocks that began as old river deltas in a prehistoric ocean floor have resisted
      weathering better than the surrounding geology to remain standing as jagged
      low mountains. The mountain thicket, heaths and mallee-heath vegetation contain
      many of the endemic plants and plant communities found in the South Coast region.
      The Barrens and Mt Ragged have distinctive wave cut benches surrounding the
      seaward sides of their bases.
  Yilgarn East:
    latitude (deg): -32
    longitude (deg): 120
    latitude range (deg): -32.5 to -35.3
    longitude range (deg): 116.7 to 124.5

    description: A complex mix of soil systems underlying a climatic transition zone
      supporting as many different vegetation types, including tall woodlands of morrel
      and salmon gum, woodlands of many species of mallet, mallee and Banksia shrubland
      and rich kwongan heathlands. This Ecodistrict is largely intact with little
      human interaction in its eastern sections.

  methods: habitat, to map in the future; Conserving the nature of complex Mediterranean-type ecosystems such as
    those of the South Coast region of Western Australia is a challenge. The first
    order for the effective conservation of such intricate systems is understanding
    how the landscape and biota developed - particularly vegetation systems, and most
    importantly the disturbance responses of the biota. The use of a systematic methodology
    is a productive way to help attain this understanding. The eco-district analysis
    (McQuoid 2009, in prep) provides a useful methodology. It identifies the region's
    natural patterns in terms of related areas by the criteria of oldest to youngest
    of geology, climate, drainages, soils and vegetation systems. It contextualises
    the physiographical patterning of landscape units and vegetation communities,
    and supports the contemplation of biological and structural responses. This method
    is designed to help identify fire sensitive systems and develop more holistic
    management recommendations for these systems. It addresses the foundations for
    the presence of the biota, its distribution patterns and the physical forces that
    support its existence.
