  description: Study investigating how limitations in resources such as water and
    nutrients, and herbivory can affect tree productivity.
  basis_of_record: field_experiment
  life_stage: sapling
  sampling_strategy: The experiment was conducted in an E. globulus plantation located
    20 km east of Hobart, Australia (42° 49.4'S, 147° 30.6'E). Soil at the site comprises
    an Aeolian sand A-horizon of 1.5-2 m depth over a sandy clay B-horizon. The bulk
    density of the A-horizon is 1.4 g cm-3 (O'Grady, Worledge & Battaglia 2005). The
    site experiences 550 mm annual average rainfall, and average pan evaporation is
    in excess of 1300 mm (Australian Bureau of Meteorology). Daily average maximum
    and minimum temperatures are 22.5 and 12.5 °C in January, and 12.0 and 4.0 °C
    in July. ^p Eucalypus globulus plants of 0.25 m height were planted at the site
    in December 2006. The plants were irrigated every second day with 3 mm municipal
    water until February 2007, when watering treatments were applied (as described
    below). Fertilizer was applied 1 month after planting, at an equivalent rate of
    25 kg N ha-1 and 15 kg P ha-1 (high N treatments), or at one-fourth this dose
    for plots allocated to low N treatments. Trace elements were included in the mix
    (O'Grady et al. 2005). Fertilizer was re-applied at 3 month intervals, making
    a total dose of 100 kg N ha-1 year-1 and 60 kg P ha-1 year-1. At the start of
    the experiment in March 2007, saplings were, on average, 1.09 m in height and
    1.16 cm in diameter at 0.15 m above ground. ^p Treatments and experimental design
    ^p The experiment was established as a completely randomized split-plot design,
    with three replicates of each of four plot-level treatments, 1) High water, high
    N (W+N+) (watered every second day with the equivalent of 1.5 mm daily, plus rainfall);
    irrigation was doubled in December 2007 to account for the increased size of the
    saplings; 2)    Low water, low N (W-N-) (rainfed only, one-fourth fertilizer dose);
    3) Low water, high N (W-N+); 4) High water, low N (W+N-) ^p Each plot comprised
    six treatment saplings surrounded by a 12-sapling buffer. The water treatments
    commenced in February 2007, at which time total soil N in the top 10 cm averaged
    6.4 and 3.1 mg kg-1 for the full- and half-fertilizer dose plots, respectively
    (Fig. 1). ^p Two defoliation treatments were randomly applied to each of three
    saplings per plot, 1) Control (no defoliation); 2) Defoliated (remove leaves from
    50% crown length in March 2007 when saplings were 3 months old, and remove leaves
    from 75% of crown length in September 2007, when saplings were 9 months old).
    The defoliation treatments removed leaves from the crown apex downwards, excluding
    apical buds. Leaves were removed using snippers. All leaf material was collected
    at each defoliation event and total leaf area removed was determined. A subsample
    of 20 leaves per sapling was taken and fresh leaf area was measured using a planimeter
    (Delta-T Devices; Cambridge, UK). Leaves were then dried at 65 °C and weighed.
    The ratio of area to dry mass [specific leaf area (SLA)] was used to calculate
    leaf area removed per sapling.

  methods: Net light-saturated CO2 uptake (Amax) and stomatal conductance (g) were
    measured on three leaves of each sapling in all treatments, using a CIRAS-1 portable
    infra-red gas analyser (IRGA) (PP Systems, Herts, UK) with a photosynthetic photon
    flux density (PPFD) of 1100 µmol m-2 s-1 and [CO2] of 370 ppm. This PPFD provided
    an average of 92% light saturation, as determined using the light response curves
    described below. Measurements were made approximately one branch whorl below the
    defoliated zone (or similar crown position for undefoliated saplings), between
    three and five leaf pairs from the branch apex. Measurements were recorded after
    Amax and g had stabilized. Temporal variation in Amax and g was examined by regular
    measurements throughout the experiment. Measurements were made prior to defoliation
    and then 2, 5, 9, 11 and 27 weeks after the first (March 2007) defoliation, and
    0, 4, 6, 10, 13 and 23 weeks after the second (September 2007) defoliation (equivalent
    to weeks 27, 31, 33, 37, 40 and 50 of the experiment). Measurements were conducted
    between 1000 and 1400 h Eastern Standard Time (EST), on clear, still days with
    minimum temperatures ranging between 5.4 and 11.7 °C, and maximum temperatures
    of between 12.0 and 24.3 °C over the course of the experiment. ^p Diurnal patterns
    in Amax and g were examined 10 weeks after the second defoliation event (37 weeks
    into the experiment). A single block was selected for this study. The day was
    divided into three hourly timeslots between 0600 and 2100 h EST. It took approximately
    2 h to measure all saplings per time slot. To minimize the effects of time of
    measurement, saplings were randomly selected for measurement in each time slot.

  methods: A non-rectangular hyperbolic function was used to describe the shape of the ACi curve of each plant. This was used to estimate the photosynthetic utilization of CO2[carboxylation efficiency (Ce)], the capacity for ribulose bisphosphate (RuBP) regeneration (Vj) and total daytime respiration (leaf dark respiration plus photorespiration, Rday) (von Caemmerer & Farquhar 1981). The potential electron transport rate (Jmax) and maximum rate of ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase (Rubisco) activity (Vcmax) were calculated using the equations of Medlyn et al. (2002) and Bernacchi et al. (2001), and adjusted to a temperature of 20 °C. Following Wullschleger (1993) and Medlyn et al. (2002), Jmax and Vcmax were fitted over the entire ACi curve using non-linear regression. The CO2 compensation point was taken as the value of Ci where net assimilation was zero.

  methods: Leaf dark respiration (Rdark) was measured on the same date as gas exchange
    measurements following the method of O'Grady et al. (2008b). Measurements were
    made using a CIRAS-1 IRGA, with a custom-made perspex chamber that included a
    fan for air mixing. The chamber had dimensions of 10 x 10 x 4 cm2. A copper-constantan
    thermocouple was placed inside the chamber to monitor the temperature. Leaf temperature
    was assumed to be equilibrated to chamber temperature. Reference [CO2] was set
    at 370 ppm, and measurements were made in a constant temperature room with an
    air temperature of 15 °C (±1.5 °C). Rdark was measured on detached leaves collected
    from the same location as that used for measurement of temporal Amax. Three fully
    expanded leaves per sapling were collected at dawn (0530 h EST) and kept cool
    in the dark until measured. The measurements were split over 3 d, with all saplings
    in one plot per plot-level treatment sampled each day. Measurements were completed
    by 1100 h EST on each day. The Amax of these leaves was measured on the day prior
    to Rdark measurements. ^p Leaves were placed into the leaf chamber and left to
    equilibrate for 10 min. Measurements were then taken at 1 min intervals until
    a constant rCO2 was observed. Following this, leaf area was measured using a planimeter.
    The leaves were dried at 65 °C and analysed for total N using the method described
    below.; units based on referenced paper, O'Grady 2008b

    by the single acid hydrogen peroxide technique (Lowther 1980). Total N (mg g-1)
    was measured with a continuous flow colorimetric auto-analyser (QuikChem 8000,

    disc (area 0.50 cm2) from each leaf was ground finely with liquid nitrogen and
    MgCO3 (c. 120 mg) using a pestle and mortar. Chlorophyll was extracted with a
    total of 6 mL of 100% acetone. Samples were kept on ice in the dark between processing
    steps. The samples were centrifuged at 2500 rpm for 3 min, and the absorption
    spectra of chlorophyll a and b were measured using a UV/vis spectrophotometer
    (Varian spectrophotometer, Varian Medical Systems, Inc., Palo Alto, CA, USA) at
    470, 645, 662 and 710 nm.

    first defoliation. SS were extracted from 50 mg of dried leaf tissue in 10 mL
    of 80% (v/v) ethanol in a 60 °C water bath. After centrifugation (10 min, 2500
    rpm), the concentration of SS was determined colorimetrically at 490 nm using
    the phenol-sulphuric acid method of Dubois et al. (1956) as modified by Buysse
    & Merckx (1993). St and complex sugars remaining in the undissolved pellet of
    plant material after ethanol extractions were enzymatically (amyloglucosidase;
    Fluka-10115, Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) reduced to glucose using the method
    detailed by Palacio et al. (2007). Carbohydrates measured after the ethanol extraction
    are referred to as SS, carbohydrates measured after the enzymatic digestion are
    referred to as St and the sum of SS and St measured in glucose equivalents is
    referred to as total non-structural carbohydrates (TNC).

  methods: Leaves measured for temporal variation in Amax were collected for analysis
    of SLA, total nitrogen (N), chlorophyll, soluble sugars (SS) and starch (St).
    Foliar N and chlorophyll were determined for pooled samples per sapling, before
    defoliation and 2, 5 and 9 weeks after the first defoliation, and 0, 4 and 6 weeks
    after the second defoliation. SS and St were examined 0, 2 and 5 weeks after the
    first defoliation. SS were extracted from 50 mg of dried leaf tissue in 10 mL
