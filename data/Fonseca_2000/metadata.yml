  description: Leaf traits for NSW environmental gradient studies. Looking at how
    trait combinations shift along rainfall and phosphorus gradients.
  basis_of_record: field
  life_stage: adult
  sampling_strategy: SITE SELECTION AND DESCRIPTION Forty-six sites were chosen in
    relation to rainfall and geological criteria (Table 1). Sites were spread from
    east to west across the rainfall gradient. Within a rainfall zone (as defined
    in Table 2), sites were required to be either in a different geology (categories
    from 1:1000 000 Australian geological series maps, Geological Survey of NSW, Department
    of Mines) or, if in the same geology, then at least 30km apart. Efforts were made
    to locate sites both on rocks with high content of phosphorus and other nutrients
    (e.g. basalts) and on rocks with low phosphorus content (e.g. sand- stones). Sites
    that were clearly run-on or run-off were avoided. Soil water potentials were not
    measured because measurements over many years would have been necessary to obtain
    a long-term site aver- age, and in any event soil water potentials reflect water
    extraction by the vegetation as well as rainfall, whereas our aim was to use site
    descriptors that were independent of vegetation. Sites greater than 600m a.s.l.
    were avoided in order to stay within a modest temperature band (c. 15+-18 _C mean
    annual temperature). For each locality, sites were selected where vegetation reflected
    species composition prior to habitat modification by people of European origin.
    At each site, five soil cores of 10-cm depth were collected and pooled. Subsamples
    were air-dried and ground to 0.2mm then digested with sulphuric acid and hydrogen
    peroxide (Anderson & Ingram 1989). Total soil P was determined colourimetrically
    by an adaptation of Murphy & Ridley's (1967) single digestion method (Anderson
    & Ingram 1989). For each site an estimate of mean annual rainfall was obtained
    by interpolation between neighbouring rainfall stations with the use of the software
    ESOCLIM (CSIRO Division of Wildlife and Ecology, Canberra). The database and interpolation
    algorithm is as described for the related software BIOCLIM (Hutchinson &Bischof
    1983).  Total soil phosphorus was adopted as the indicator of soil nutrients at
    each site since (i) phosphorus is provided from the parent rock that characterizes
    the site, in contrast to nitrogen, which is substantially provided by nitrogen
    fixation (that is, by the vegetation itself); (ii) although only some soil phosphorus
    is readily available for plant growth and other short-term physiological processes,
    the total represents a pool of resource that has been available over the hundreds
    to thousands of years during which the present-day species mixture at the site
    has been assembled; (iii) other rock-derived nutrients, such as magnesium,are
    strongly correlated with phosphorus in rock, being influenced mainly by the proportion
    of nutrient-bearing minerals vs. quartz in the rock; and (iv) phosphorus is regarded
    as the most important single nutrient in shaping vegetation in temperate Australia
    (Beadle 1954; 1966).  FIELD SAMPLING  At each site, a single quadrat of 50_20m
    (0.1 ha) was surveyed with the aim of finding all vascular species apparent above-ground.
    Vouchers collected for subsequent identification are deposited in Macquarie University
    herbarium. Percentage canopy outline cover of each species within the plot was
    estimated by eye. The present paper reports results for perennials only. Ephemerals
    were excluded because it was not possible to sample them consistently (they were
    not growing at all sites at the time of visit). In addition, their traits would
    not relate to year-round rainfall in the same way as for perennials. (Nearly all
    perennials are evergreen within the study area). Epiphytes, parasites and vines
    were excluded on the basis that canopy height estimates do not reflect the same
    height-support trade-off as for self-supporting species. Also, para- sites like
    mistletoes do not pay the root-construction costs for supporting their transpiration
    needs.

  notes: There are 9 cases where a species has the same trait values at multiple sites,
    but otherwise a given species does have unique/different trait values across sites.

  methods: Five leaves were collected and pressed for measurements of width, area
    and SLA. Leaves were taken from full-light situations and, where possible, from
    random branches on separate individuals (see Westoby 1998, appendix, for discussion
    of protocols for characterizing leaves and height). Leaf outline images were captured
    by HP DeskScan II scanner (Hewlett-Packard, Palo Alto, USA) and quantified by
    Delta-T SCAN image analysis software (Delta-T Devices, Cambridge, UK). No information
    given on protocol for determining mass.

    species. If only seedlings were present within the quadrat, full-grown individuals
    were sought nearby. (This trait, plant_height, is excluded, because it measures
    current individual plant height, not the species maximum height.)
