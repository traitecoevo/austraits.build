Description: The Austraits database (AusTraits)  is an open-source platform for 
    ongoing compilation and distribution of data on the traits of Australian 
    plant species. Data have been assembled from diverse sources, describing 
    more than 300 plant traits and over 23k species. This repository contains all
    the information needed to build the resource from different sources, i.e.
    harmonise the different datasets into a common structure,
    with common variable names, units and structure. Also included are the functions
    we use to help with adding new studies. Note the compiled database is available from
    https://github.com/traitecoevo/austraits.
