Description: AusTraits is an open-source platform for
    ongoing compilation and distribution of data on the traits of Australian
    plant species. Data have been assembled from diverse sources, describing
    more than 300 plant traits and over 25k taxa. This repository contains all
    the information needed to build the resource from different sources, i.e.
    harmonise the different datasets into a common structure,
    with common variable names, units and structure. Also included are the functions
    we use to help with adding new studies. For more information on the project
    go to https://austraits.org.
